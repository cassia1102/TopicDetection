Edward L. Harwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best machine I have used.,the United States,14-Jul-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I used my first vac 6 times before it started shutting off after 3 sec.  I notified Tineco because I was one week out of Amazon send back. I have used hoover floor jet, Koplens and Bissil wet dry vacs. No experience with Bissil crossfire.I was impressed with being able to contact customer service by phone with no wait time. They requested a video of the problem which is reasonable but for me hard as I am 84 y/o and not technically proficient. Customer service answered my 4 phone calls promptly and sent me a new vac promptly. The machine is fault free in use. I have porceline tile. In short I give 5 stars to machine and customer service.  I hope this keeps up. I will update after more use.UPDATE: I have never written an update on anything but due to the product quality and the customer service  I feel the need. No product lasts forever but it was nice to talk to humans and send your vac back and get a new one postage free. My replacement $300 Tineco 3 is working great after about a month. Wish I could put this under 1 star so peeople will read it. I mostly read only the bad reviews as god ones are often too numerous.",951
JPG,4.0 out of 5 stars,Addictive... should. be 5 stars but.,the United States,9-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"After using the Tineco Floor One S3 for several months, you don't want to use anything else. Not even the vacuum. It is addictive once you get used to it. It has it's learning curve, but once you understand all its functions you will not, and let me repeat that... You will not want to use a mop ever again. If you think your floors are kept clean, wait until you use this machine.Pros: There are so many... I will be really brief.It does everything as advertisedSimple to clean and maintainNo messComes with 2 rollers and 2 filters.Great customer serviceWell thought.Although, it is a great machine, it has very few drawbacks. Remember, it is addictive?Well...Cons:The battery. Since it is lightweight the battery is the heaviest part of it, there for its autonomy.Depending on how dirty or clean are your floors and how big your house is perfect for 550 sq ft at onceIt takes at least 1.5h ‚Äî 2 hours to charge before you can use it again. Big house, long wait.The auto-cleaning process consumes a lot of battery and it is heavily recommended you clean it immediately or it will start to smell.In my opinion, it'll be perfect if, the charge time was faster and/or you could exchange the battery for continuing use.",450
Martina,5.0 out of 5 stars,A time and life saver,the United States,12-Jul-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This is a must have for anyone with hardwood or vinyl flooring. Our household includes both a toddler (who is just beginning to learn how to fling food on the floor) and a hyperactive dog. We have a cordless dry vacuum that we would often use, but it just wasn't enough and would still require mopping afterwards. Because of this, we were spending a ridiculous amount of time cleaning just to try to keep up with all of the various food, vomit, and other messy substances around the house.This Tineco is a gamechanger for us because we no longer have to compromise between time and cleanliness. The battery lasts long enough for us to do the major problem areas (kitchen, dining room, living room) on a single charge. Even when the floor looks ""clean"" to the naked eye, the Tineco's dirty water tank tells a different story and you will be cleaning grime you had no idea existed (especially if you have an older hardwood floor with gaps between the boards). The unit has a self cleaning feature when it's on the charger, but you will still want to remove the roller every once in a while to clean by hand and fully dry. I would easily recommend this to anyone who has more than one or two rooms in their house with hard flooring, as I know it will help them as much as it has helped us.",451
Our Best Friends Rescue Inc.,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW! Blows the Bissell Crosswave Away,the United States,25-Sep-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant to order this machine as I was unfamiliar with the brand. I read a few reviews that there were some problems with it ceasing to operate. I've gone through 2 Bissell Crosswaves in under 2 years and really needed to get a machine that worked without all the issues the crosswave had.I took the plunge, but did purchase the extended warranty just in case I do have issues with it.Shipping was a bit slow so the mop and bucket were out as well as the scrub brush which I needed with the crosswave anyway. It never was good removing anything that had dried.When my Tineco arrived I was hoping for at least the performance I had with the crosswave. I took it out of the box and inserted the handle which was a breeze, removed all the packing, it was definitely packed 1000 times better than the crosswave, plugged in the charger and set the machine into it.I let it charge overnight and tried it out the next morning. Holy Wow!!!!! Was I surprised! The suction on this machine was incredible. It's got adjustable suction power which really helps getting the dog hair up, the other machine was not the best with that. It did not stop and say the machine was clogged once! The other machine did it constantly. Dried on stuff came up like a dream. Dog hair was nonexistent! What a pleasure it is not have to sweep and then use the machine and then sweep again.When I turned off the machine there was no puddle of dirty water left on the floor as was the case with the crosswave, that would need a few paper towels to sop up.The tanks are a bit smaller than on the crosswave, but it makes the machine so much lighter that it's okay with me.Cleaning the machine is also easier than the crosswave. I don't have to stick my hand in the dirty water tank to remove the hair catch, that was really kind of a disgusting thing to have to do on a machine that costs that much. Not a good design feature at all.Not once did the new machine clog, tell me to empty the dirty water tank unless it was full or have any other malfunctions lights go off.The cleaning solution that comes from the manufacturer is terrific. It did not need to be measured into a measuring cup like the old one. One small capful is all that was needed making the filling of the clean water tank easy peasy. My kitchen tile looks better than it has in years and my LVT in the rest of the house is cleaner than it's been since it was installed.I recommend this floor cleaner over the Bissell machine 100%. I do recommend getting the extended warranty just in case, but that's just my personal thought.",330
MBA Squared,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cleans a variety of floors with minimal effort, great product!",the United States,24-Jul-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This is a remarkable mopper! I have used it all over my house for the past several days, can‚Äôt tell you how impressed I am! We have a lot of different hard surfaces in my home: tile wood and cork. I have included a video of his performance on each type of floor. The first thing I noticed is how easy it is to operate. I barely looked at the instructions, just plugged in the first night and started using it the next day. The only thing I checked was how to refill the water, which is super easy as it‚Äôs the container on top and I added the recommended cap full of cleaning solution.  I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how this product essentially pulls itself. You might notice in the videos I am operating it with one hand, and sometimes one finger. I also noticed I was able to use this on dirty floors without sweeping first. It collects dust and debris along with the water, you‚Äôll see what you collect when you dump it out and you will be grossed out and impressed at the same time. In the video, I cleaned my white tile with a pattern so easily, and as you can imagine that is such a pain to keep clean. It‚Äôs beautiful but now that I have this mop or it will be as beautiful as it should be more often.  Then, you‚Äôll see me bounce over to the cork floors, as easy as the tile was this was much easier if you can imagine. I don‚Äôt mop these floors very often, but I couldn‚Äôt help but mop the entire basement and I would say it took less than 10 minutes (2200 square feet). It‚Äôs lightweight so its easy to carry up and down the steps, I even mopped the steps and I‚Äôm not saying it was super easy but there is no good way to mop the steps and the result was better than normal. But, I‚Äôve used it upstairs extensively. The wood floors upstairs gets so nasty, so for me, this mop was the solution for that. I can do the entire floor in about 20 minutes (4000square feet), but I rarely do that. I‚Äôm using a small primarily in the kitchen and living space, I use it daily and it takes just a couple of minutes. In one charge I get around 30 minutes, and that is  alternating between auto and Max. The more often I use it, I am able to use the auto setting more. In one use, expect to refill the water container at least twice. There is a voice alert that will let you know when you need to do that, as well as any other part of the mop that needs attention.Overall, this mop was definitely worth the investment. I wish I could say I‚Äôm going to throw out my mop but I will still need it to get into small corners, around toilets for example, but it will definitely replace my mop for almost everything. I also used to dry mop much more frequently, this is replacing some of that, especially in high traffic areas like the kitchen. It came with lots of accessories, an extra filter, an extra roller, and hardware it looks like to mount. I haven‚Äôt found a home for it yet so I will look into that later. For now, I‚Äôm just enjoying my clean floors, clean it with minimal effort and that‚Äôs how I roll!",254
Debra Hendrickson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best floor machine I‚Äôve ever purchased,the United States,4-May-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant.  Every gadget holds the big promise of being the best thing ever.  I‚Äôm glad I bought the unit.  I‚Äôve had fractured vertebrae and major back surgery.  This machine is so light and easy to use that even with a very bad back, I can use this!  It cleans my textured tile floors spotless.  The suction is unbelievable.  It‚Äôs an amazing device.  It‚Äôs efficient.  It‚Äôs quiet.  Love the self cleaning feature!  Best money I‚Äôve spent in a long time.  It looks durable- I hope it is.  No regrets",232
Dexter1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time!!!,the United States,7-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I have owned a Bissell Crosswave for three years.  That‚Äôs three years and three new Crosswaves.  I don‚Äôt know why their so highly rated because you have to replace them yearly after they quit working!  Looking for a different option I found this one.  A little more expensive but worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY!!!  I LOVE this thing!!! I can just grab it off the charger and get to it.  No hassling with cords, no spending time at the end cleaning every piece because it‚Äôs self cleaning!  What a great concept and it pulls a lot of dirt out of the brush roll and internal parts.  I love that it‚Äôs self propelled because I have a bad back and knees and it runs itself with me just to guide it!  It cleans much better than my old Crosswave, leaving my wood floors streak free.  My floors would look terrible after cleaning with my Crosswave.  It only takes 1 cap of solution with the water so you save on cleaning solution.  I didn‚Äôt think I really needed it to talk to me but it‚Äôs great because it reminds me to start cleaning cycle, fill water tank, empty dirty tank, etc.This machine is stellar in every way.  The only con is it has an internal battery so once the two year battery warranty has expired and the battery gives out I guess you have to replace it.  Even do its then lasted twice as long as my old Crosswave!  And maybe the battery will last 5 years- who knows?  No one has had one long enough to judge because it‚Äôs a pretty new item in their line.Don‚Äôt think twice and make your life easier!  Buy it now!  Lol I‚Äôm not getting paid to write thisüòä",139
Sunshine Mel,5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm excited to mop when I use this to clean my fooors,the United States,22-Jul-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Wow! This floor cleaner absolutely blows my mind! It mood and vacuums and chooses on its own which to use with its own sensor. It can even tell the level of dirtiness and use the proper setting. Every time I‚Äôve used it I am immediately start smiling and laughing because it makes it so fun! Once you turn it on you can let it propel itself forward and mop and vacuum depending on what your floor requires. Now I actually enjoy mopping. It arrived with a bottle of solution you mix with water and put in the top container for it to clean with. The bottom container has the filter and where the gray water goes that you will dump. At the end of your cycle you do need to clean everything so it will work fine next use. It even decides whether it should begin a self cleaning cycle when you put it back on the charging base. It comes with an extra filter and the cleaning brush. If you have a lot of bare floors at your house I would definitely recommend this.,206
Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Labor Saving Device,the United States,29-Dec-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Y'all ready for a 5 start review?  I just used my Tineco Floor 1 cordless for the first time.  I hadn't moped since after Christmas and hadn't vacuumed since yesterday.  I am SO excited!  I'm a sucker for convenience saving cleaning devices and technology.  You name it and when I could afford it within reason, I get it.  I have an old Eufy vacuum, named Rosy, a Shark vacuum with the 30 day reservoir - Jaws, a battery operated scrub brush.  I've an old Floor Mate, 2 regular size carpet cleaners - different brands in my hall closet.  Plus a Dyson stick cordless - Suckered.  I had been seeing a competitor's version on TV and was really interested in it.  Did my research and decided on ""Tina"" instead.  I took her out of the box just over an hour ago.  Simple to put together.  Did I mention I don't read instructions?  Put her on her charger but couldn't wait for a full charge.  Mopped my kitchen - waterproof Pergo- and the living room, 2 small halls with adjoining small bathrooms - tile - on less than a 75% charge.  Maneuvers like a dream.  A little difficult going around the toilets, not hey.  Cleaned very well, even cleaned up washable creation and pencil marks from grand children and spill splashes from Christmas that got missed.  The auction was great, even got a small bug (don't judge, the doors were opened a lot).  I was amazed at how dirty the reservoir water was.  Tina let me know when to empty and when to refill.  She warned me when the battery was starting to get to low and took me through the steps for the self cleaning.  The hardest part I have is replacing the clean water reservoir.  Again I don't read instructions.  Sorry this review is so long but at the moment, I'm in love.  If anything changes, I'll update my review.",104
T. Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,25-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"So, I have a very old dog who has been having problems these days. I was using a traditional mop multiple times a day to clean up after her. Having to prepare mop water every time there was a mess (starting before my coffee!) got to be a tiresome.I initially bought the Tineco iFLOOR Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop, which worked OK for my needs, but then my hubby suggested I the higher end one, TINECO Floor One S3 Cordless Hardwood Floors Cleaner, I was glad I did.TINECO Floor One S3 is a little heavier than the Tineco iFLOOR, but that is OK since it is self propelled once it is powered up. I love that once you put it on the charging mat, it starts a check of the roller to see if it needs to be cleaned. Press a button and self-cleaning starts! Basically, I love this mop! It has saved me a lot of effort when I have to quickly clean up a spot.Cons: Well, there are a few.- Corners. I have found you have to be able to roll over the mess. So, I can't give up my traditional mop altogether, but this works in a pinch.- Modes: it has two - Auto and Max Clean. Wish there were three. Auto, Max Clean and Suction. Wish there was a way to suck up the puddle then mop over it.-Clean Water Tank (CWT) and Dirty Water Tank (DWT). Wish they were bigger. But not a game changer.If you are like me, you research (a lot) before spending hard earned $. Glad I did. This mop is worth every penny.",112
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,KILLS THE CROSSWAVE,the United States,30-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the Tineco S3 at the same time as a Bissell Crosswave Pro so that I would not ever wonder if I purchased the wrong one.  The bissell was sent back pretty immediately.  This is for hard flooring only and the crosswave is supposed to be able to switch back and forth between hard flooring and carpet.The dirt left behind with the crosswave called it for me.  I don't care if it can do a ""decent job"" on two types of flooring.  I would rather own two units that do an immaculate job on their specified flooring.  I like my  house clean!!! not semi clean!The suction on this with it being cordless is absolutely impressive.  The roller is so compact it is perfect for hard flooring.My only complaints are - battery life.  But its a fair trade for it being cordless!  Second complaint is the smaller water tank,  BUT! again it alerts you to clean it out so that it can continue to clean with full power/suction.  It really is an all around well thought out product.The cherry on top is the Tineco is aesthetically pleasing.  So if you do not have somewhere to store it and it has to be left out in the open it's not a giant purple or green eye sore.",87
Lisa B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,19-Jun-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"You know you're an adult when you get excited about getting a vacuum in the mail! I spent weeks online trying to find one that would be perfect for my floors. I live in a house built in the 1940's and the hardwood is the original flooring without any sealant on it. So, I was hesitant about buying a wet/dry vacuum for this reason. I took the plunge and bought this one and I am so glad I did! To test it I only did a small patch on my floor. Oh my gosh!!!! I don't think those floors have ever been clean before I moved in! I had a Swif**r but I didn't feel it was actually cleaning. Now I know it wasn't because that small patch I went over looks like a different floor!! I am waiting until those little parasites that live with me go away for the summer. Then, it is just me and my vacuum making the living room a better place. A little music and some wine...then hello clean floors! Well worth the price!",94
Gloria ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,7-Sep-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I've used this vacuum cleaner for over 2 weeks. The suction power is strong enough to clean the small pieces on the floor. The floor is a little bit damp after using the cleaner but it will dry in 1 to 2 minutes. It doesn't leave streaks and also removes the stains on the floor pretty easy. The vacuum cleaner is light weight and one good thing is that it moves forward so it will save you some energy. The battery can last about 30 minutes and you might need to empty the dirty water tank once in the middle. It will also remind you to run the self cleaning function after each use to keep it clean. Very easy to install and remove the water tanks and the roller. It's smaller than what I thought so it doesn't take a lot of space. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and it saves a lot of work on cleaning the hard floor.,90
Heather L. Graham,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is amazing,the United States,18-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I have 3 dogs, 3 kids and lots of hardwood floors.  I can't get over how well the TINECO cleans the floors & vacuums all the dog hair up.  It does not leave my walnut floors overly wet and it really sucks up the dirt (see my picture).  It is super easy to clean and a full charge will cover all my hard surface areas.  I am so happy I spent the money on this.  It has made mopping / vacuuming so much easier and less time consuming.",81
Kagan whitten,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have wood floors, this is a MUST",the United States,16-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"No matter how well I would dust/vacuum our wooden floors there was always that line of debris when mopping/swiffering etc afterwards. This has easily cut the cleaning of our floors in half, more like 70% honestly. It practically moves itself with just a little push. Always using clean water so you're not using the dirty water to clean your floors. It's not the best at getting close to the floorboards or corners of the room but the little extra time I take to clean those manually is nothing compared to the overall saving of time. The self-cleaning mode is also incredible. Run, do not walk to purchase this product. Especially if you have wood flooring.",78

Light weight and very easy to clean with. Best part is how everything comes apart to clean it thoroughly and everything goes back in right places without any problems. The only things I‚Äôd say i don‚Äôt like about it, even thou i love it overall, is that i have to fill water and clean dirty water three times to mop my whole floor. However i don‚Äôt often mop the entire floor in one setting, so it not a deal breaker to me. I‚Äôd prefer smaller mop anyway and fill it more times then not having space for giant one.Also i love that when it‚Äôs charged it‚Äôll stop charging even if it‚Äôs still plugged in. I was concerned about that when it says it takes 6-8 hours to charge. That I‚Äôd leave it on charge to long. But it stops charging.",74

Sjcs24,1.0 out of 5 stars,Gotta give you the dirt on this vacuum!,the United States,21-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was super excited to get this on sale during Prime days.  I have had many months to use it and therefore have experienced it enough to give my honest review of it.  I purchased this because we own a german shepherd and anyone who has a dog that sheds as much will understand why I wanted this all-in-one vacuum and mop wonder.  I follow all directions and use only the cleanser that was included with the product fyi. Even though we groom our dog and I do my floors every single day, this still would clog so quickly.  Everything from the dirty collection cup down to where the roller brush is.  After using it only 5 minutes it would want to ""self-clean"".  Which means it would have to be put on the charger again, and then I'd have to constantly empty and fill the dirty and clean cups.  To the point to where I ended up buying another vacuum (Shark brand) just to vacuum the hair before I even used the Tineco.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of having it.  Now, if it actually mopped well enough I would overlook this and happily keep using it.  However, the gaps it leaves along the sides and in the front against a wall, etc. knocks out the fully clean floors look for me.  We mostly have hard wood floors and you can see any amount of dust or hair left. So needless to say, I am not happy with this purchase nor would I recommend it.  Not even to houses without pets on account of the amount that's left around all edges.",58

J. Crawford,3.0 out of 5 stars,6 Month Review -  The Good & Bad.,the United States,31-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This was not an easy sale. I have had my fair share of gimmicks and come to the general conclusion that there is no fix for a quality vacuum and a solid cotton-head mop and bucket. But both of those things require the effort to use them. Which then means you don't use them as much as you'd like.And because of that my wife and I both fell in love with Tineco. For spot jobs it was amazing. We have pets and pets make messes. And if you have tile and hardwood flooring, this is machine is amazing. It's almost perfect. And frankly this is where I would list the few gripes I have, but they are so minor and nitpicky, it's not worth the effort.However, I'm writing this review today because we just sent ours back to get repaired. And as much as I hate that, I'm hoping they will take care of us and in a timely manner. We use the Tineco just about every day. Not for long stretches, but certainly a few minutes. And while it's easy to get upset about it breaking, we now have an opportunity to see how they stand behind their product.So, hit the ""Useful"" button to follow along. I'll let you know how everything works out in a few weeks when we get our repaired unit back.We really miss it.",45

Thien D Tien,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cost is hight but performances are just fine.,the United States,17-Aug-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Been using this vacuumed for couple of months now. The vacuum does a decent job overall, however considering its price I wouldn't buy it again based on several defects that don't justify the price.First of all, due to its design the brush can't reach the edges but actually leaves a space of 1-2 inches of untouched surface (doesn't suck nor clean the area). The brush also seems pretty thin - I would have used a thicker brush that helps with stronger cleaning power.Also, many drops of water/liquid are left by the vacuum on the surface (I use it mainly on hardwood floor) and these won't dry in couple of minutes unless with dry cloth or similar.The vacuum also spills water from the dirty water container during the auto cleaning while stationig on its charging base.The suction power isn't that strong as advertised. I need in fact to use my other vacuum for a complete cleaning.Noise is decent and lower than other vacuum on the market.Light weight and battery are decent.",48

Never buy tineco again if this is the quality of their products.,the United States,19-Feb-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I have followed your instructions to a tee!  I clean religiously after use.  I leave apart to dry properly after use.  Then when I go to use it next  time it will run for about 3 seconds and tells me to clean dirty water tank or debris channel.  I've just started cleaning so obviously the dwt is empty and debris channel is clean.  I keep shutting off and returning hundreds of times.  No luck!This problem started within 2 months of owning this product and has just continued to get worse to now where the mop is completely unusable.And this isn't n due to over use or neglect.  The floors were not super dirty or overloaded with debris.  This is ridiculous!So this problem makes your mop/ vacuum COMPLETELY useless.  I splurged for the first time on a cleaning product, thinking I would really have a nice product.  All I have is a heaping pile of crap!!!!!I would give zero stars if I could!  Pathetic!!!",44
Brittani Bailey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best Valentines Gift Ever,the United States,19-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,,"I would give this product 5 stars, but it runs for a few minutes and then it flashes for a self clean in the middle of the cleanup. So, I have to re-dock it and let it self cleanse, empty out the container, re-fill it and finish.However, it does a great job with quick cleanups, especially behind my toddler.Powerful suction- it glides itself, you just guide it. I used to use a steam mop and I immediately threw it to the curb after I ran my tineco over it. It picked up so much dirt on my hardwood floors, it was disgusting.

Esther,2.0 out of 5 stars,The idea of it is wonderful but...,the United States,26-Apr-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"The idea of it is wonderful but.... if you want to go close to the wall to vacuum some dirt, dust, water or anything u can think of, the vacuum wont pick it up. It can only vacuum and wash 1-1 1/2 inch away from the wall/baseboards ( u name it). U have to take a broom or a regular vacuum to clean very close to the wall because this vacuum wont do it. Another thing that i would of liked to be different: when you push the vacuum forward you will have the wheels marks on your floors. Another one: you cannot go under couch or tables with it, if you tilt it too much the brush will come up too high and wont touch the floors. For the money you pay for it you expect at least to clean all the way to the wall and not to be forced to redo the job with the broom. The dirty water tank could be bigger, it fiLs up too quickly.",47
John M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stay away- Other reviews do not make sense,the United States,27-Apr-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Updated; The manufactor and seller should offer a refund and free upgrade when the next version comes out.  Stopped working after a month due to lack of suction, and the electronic voice goes off every 5 minutes regardless of whether the tank is wet or dry.  Basically, very poor suction, not as advertised in the least bit.  Very bad product and borderline scam of a tool that is way over-priced and not at all what was promised.  I should have went with one of the Bissells.I was very critical to spend money on this, but the reason I splurged on the newer model was due to the 35-40 minute battery life.  The machine also is very small.  Do not let that betray you when you are choosing between that and the Bissell.  Quality wise I think this item is a bit higher in terms of parts, however, seeing as how I only had a Bissell vacuum that broke down, I wouldn't say I really can compare it to the Crosswave Max.  With that being said it did the job and I did have to change the clean water tank between 2-3x before I was done- but that is just how it works.  Solid, fluid, and easy to manage, I also found it worked decent on the area rugs I have after about 2 passes.  If you have a big house, I would go with a Bissell or other mop vacuum, but I am happy with this purchase, because it takes 1/3 of the time to vacuum and mop and that is why it was made.",44

I had purchased a different vacuum/mop machine and sent it back immediately to get this one! I have 5 cats and an Australian Shepherd. The shedding is constant but this machine keeps up! Because it‚Äôs cordless and so easy to clean I literally use it every morning before letting my 9 month old daughter crawl around so she‚Äôs not getting dirty or germy.

Aimer L'infini,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing vacuum that has cut my cleaning routine down by more than half,the United States,27-Jul-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Let me start by saying how AMAZING this smart vacuum really is. I was skeptical, how can a vacuum keep dirt, clean water, and dirty water separate? Whoever designed this knew exactly what they were doing in that department because nothing ever mixes. I can go from a dirt spot and then mop it immediately.Battery life is decent. I usually need to recharge tho because my entire house is hardwood so this would be inevitable with any battery I feel. I've not had one of these in the past to compare it to, but it pleases me with how long I can keep it running.My floors are left streak free and looking absolutely gorgeous and it's done with very little effort from me. The vacuum is lightweight and cordless so taking it from upstairs to downstairs is very simple. There's a docking station that keeps everything stored nicely while charging your vacuum at the same time. My most favorite part is that this is self cleaning. Aside from emptying tanks I don't have to take it apart to clean the inside tubes or roller because I push a button and the vacuum does it for me!This has saved me so much time. My routine before was to sweep the floors with a broom then go over them with a vacuum, after that I would mop with cleaner, then I'd go through and mop with clean water, then last but not least I'd apply a floor solution to keep my floors shiny and beautiful. This was something that used to take me several hours to complete the entire house, now I'm done in a quarter of that time because I've been able to eliminate multiple steps and combine them all into one with this gem of a vacuum. One small con is the size of the dirty water tank, I have to empty it a few times during use, and fill up the clean water, but for as portable as this is it's really not that big of a deal, more of a preference. If you're considering this I would definitely recommend trying it out, it's been a life saver for me!",104
pretty picky,3.0 out of 5 stars,Measure your wants vs. your needs first!!,the United States,1-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This is a great little, convenient unit.  However, I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs worth the price I paid.  It‚Äôs great that it talks to me and tells me when the tanks are empty or full because I get distracted when I‚Äôm cleaning and don‚Äôt always notice it, but do I really need to track my ‚Äúcleaning habits‚Äù on my iPhone?  The answer is no.  Another reason I wish I had bought ‚Äúthe other brand‚Äù, is that this gadget DOES NOT clean close to the walls.  It leaves about a 2‚Äù gap of uncleaned, unmopped space along all of the walls.  If you think this is going to take the place of your swiffer vac, or your regular mopping, deep cleaning chore, you‚Äôre wrong.  This is no ‚ÄúRosie Robot‚Äù.  At best, it‚Äôs fantastic for spills and a light ‚Äúswish‚Äù before company comes. Also, don‚Äôt be fooled by the ‚Äúself cleaning‚Äù feature. It does a pretty good job of rinsing off the roller, but you still have to take all of the removable parts off and  rinse them.  Finally, do not expect this cleaner to just tuck away in a closet or corner. When it‚Äôs on the base/charger, it leans awkwardly forward and not snug against the wall. In the picture, the top of the handle is about 15 inches off my wall.",21
Jessica Beam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Time Saving and Easy to Use,the United States,16-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"So far I really like it! I absolutely hate sweeping and even though I dont mind mopping (or using our Swifer Wetjet), I still had to sweep beforehand and it takes forever. This device was easy to put together and easy to work. I managed to clean our laundry room, hallway, and about 1/3 of the kitchen on one tank and in about 10-15 mins. I could have refilled it and kept going but I just wanted to try it out today and am waiting until later to run it through the rest of my house.Pros-‚Ä¢Quieter than I expected.‚Ä¢Only needs a cap full of the included cleaning solution.‚Ä¢Doesn't leave the floor soaking wet.‚Ä¢Did well with dog hair and dried on stains.‚Ä¢I only used it on ECO mode and not MAX but it got the job done.‚Ä¢Pretty easy to empty and clean the dirty tank. I just dumped the dirty water and debris out in the toilet and gave the tank a rinse.‚Ä¢Self cleaning mode worked well and quickly.‚Ä¢It kind of propels itself so its super easy to push around.‚Ä¢Significantly cuts down on time because I dont have to sweep beforehand, which is a dream.‚Ä¢The clean water/solution tank lasts longer than expected.The one and only con I have so far is that I can't get super close to the edges of the walls and baseboards. I tried going along the edges with the side of the mop and then tried to see how close I could get with the front, but still couldn't get it closer than about an inch from the wall. Its not a huge deal, but its definitely a bit of an inconvenience.So far, I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating based on this first impression.",27

Asusuan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product,the United States,23-Sep-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"The only issue is that the battery does not last long enough to mop my whole house.  However, it does an amazing job.  I have 2100 square feet to mop.  If you have a smaller home that should not be an issue.  To me it is worth it regardless of the battery time issue.  I just put it back on the charger and do other chores around the house, then finish mopping when the battery is recharged.  I know the floor is clean because i tested it.  I take a wet paper towel and try to get any dirt left by the mop and literally nothing is on the paper towel.  I would recommend this product to everyone who has laminate or wood floors.  It is worth every penny.UPDATE:  I used it for three months.  It just one day stopped working.  I get it, these things happen.  I called because it is under warranty.  Its been a month and I feel like I am getting the run around.  At first they said they will send me a new base because they thought maybe this was the problem.  The base never showed up.

Also won‚Äôt suck anything larger than a grain of rice. Has to be charged 3 times to clean my house. Also I have to empty it and put new water in it every 3 minutes because the containers are so small. I‚Äôve used more cleaner running a self cleaning cycle than actually cleaning my floor. Ants getting the containers back on right is so finicky and if even slightly off it will poor all the dirty water straight on the floor or will run with no clean water going through.

D. Gingue,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and quiet but quit after 5 months,the United States,1-Jun-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE:  quit working after 5 months.  I really loved it while it worked, but have been having intermittent problems.  Time I would asked me to send a video. Well, they just got a video of the machine but sucking anything up.  This was expensive for only 5 months of use.  Let's see how good their customer service us.ORIGINAL: I was a little skeptical about this machine.  I used to have a Floormate, the first lasted several years, the next two lasted until just after the warranty expired.  I switched to Crosswave.  On the first two Crosswaves, the brush motors stopped working after a few months.  Bissell sent warranty replacements.  The next two the suction motors died just out of warranty.  I really loved the crosswave - it did  great job but replacing them constantly or waiting for a warranty replacement became annoying.  The Floor one is so quiet, except for the voice prompts which can be muted.  It doesn't over-wet the floor, and it really does a great job on stuck on stuff that I had to scrape off when using the Crosswave.  It has a water only mode that I love for quick clean up when the dogs come in with muddy paws.  Not having a cord is great, On heavy cleaning days it means putting the machine on the charger between rooms. I was able to do my entire downstairs (a little less than 1000 sq ft) on one charge.  My husband didn't have to turn up the TV to hear over the cleaner like he had to with the Floormate or the Crosswave.  I was able to do out stair treads - I wasn't able to with the Crosswave or the Floormate. Now, let's see if this holds up better the the Crosswave and Floormate.  Fingers Crossed!!",18

Battery still had 2 bars, and my floors were practically spotless to begin with! I have no pets in the house and there was nothing on the floors except a couple of tiny crumbs from where my son ate dinner! I had to dump the dirty water tank once during cleaning and again during one of the self clean cycles.

Ashley,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I had expected,the United States,26-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"So I've been waiting to write a review. I've had this for about two months now. I have to say at first I was really upset because it was not what I had expected. I thought this was going to scrub my floors and I would finally throw away my dreaded mop. For the amount of money I would at least expect that. But no.What did get me to slowly start to like it was my son had dropped a jar of artichoke hearts in oil on the tile and it went everywhere. I picked up the larger parts and food and decided it was time to really put this baby to the test. I have to say it did impress me. It cleaned up the oil, and small bits of glass and didn't leave the oil residue. I had the mess cleaned up in literally 2 min and I didn't have to scrub anything.  So I had decided to keep it because it is nice to have for spot cleaning and smaller messes, as well as in between mops.With that being said here are the pros and consPro:-For quick clean ups this is perfect. Even if your dog has an accident in the house. ( Which our puppy did twice )- Easy to clean and the self cleaning option is pretty fantastic.- Very light weight and maneuvers very easily.- The vacuum works great but I want to note there is no option for vaccum or mop it's always vaccum and mop.- if you have tile that showed everything on it like mine. This is a great in between moping.Cons- holding tank is super small, the same for the clean water tank. If you are using it on max the water will last you about 5 min.- this is not to replace mopping by any means. This is JUST for little clean up or in between.- the charge does not last long at all. And it takes forever to recharge. My house is about 2800sqft and I do one room at a time in between charges. It's totally horrible and not practical.",10

Chelsie Luttrell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good machine but short battery life is a frustration.,the United States,19-Sep-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I like the efficiency of the machine that does both mopping and vacuuming at the same time however I wish the battery was better. It cleans the floor very well, but it's not able to get all the way to the edge, so that leaves a small area to do manually. It is difficult to only have enough battery life to get through part of the house then have to charge for 4 hours before I can finish. It would be nice if the battery could last at least 40-45 minutes instead of 20-25 on eco mode. Overall I am happy with it though. I think it will save me time in the long run.",13

I feel like its being moved around rather than being cleaned up. The cleaning solution tank is small so after every use you need to add new solution. The dirty water tank is also small so you need to empty out the container after using it, turn on slef clean mode and then empty out again. Not really worth the money. If I had the box still I would of returned it. Not worth 320 spent.",15
Diane Belanger,3.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 1 use!,the United States,13-Jun-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Stopped suctioning after 1 use!! Called Customer service. Will update after their responseCustomer service was very good with responding and sending me a replacement. The first replacement was another model which also didn‚Äôt work properly (telling me to clean the brush roll very 5 min ) and they replaced that one with the correct model. The new replacement works great! I love the ergonomics - very easy to use for someone with a back pain. Cleans very well and easy to clean! The unit actually tells you when to empty the dirty water tank and when to refill the clean water tank. The cleaning solution is streak less and very effective. I asked for an extended warranty Because of my concerns about reliability ( the unit comes with a 2 year warranty) and customer service agreed but they keep replying that the extended warranty is 2 years. Not sure if that is a language barrier problem. Love the unit for it‚Äôs streamlined look and self cleaning features. Much easier to clean then my daughter‚Äôs Bissell Crosswave.,13

Def. Not enough time to do a big room or two rooms on one battery.-after a few passes in the kitchen, it wanted to me put it back on the charger in order to self clean. This happened almost every time. Granted, there was fur on the floor, but not enough for me to understand why it needed cleaned after 5-10 swipes.-it wasn‚Äôt great with dog hairIf you don‚Äôt have a dog that sheds, this might work well for you.

I normally don't leave bad reviews but if i could go back and not buy this I would. Im going to make this short and sweet as best I can with all the issues I ran into.The vacuum itself is so cheaply made, its not sturdy and just slides around the floor unless going in a direct up and down movement.It LEAKS.... the dirty water tank wasn't close to full and it was spraying dirty water all over the base and my floors. Also leaks from the sides of the dirty water tank and drips behind leaving you to clean it up anyways. Don't try using this under chairs either or places to get under bc it will LEAK!My downstairs is pretty open but small and I had to refill the tank 4 times just to finish the floors. Also emptying the dirty water several times.When using it, i wasnt 5 minutes in when the self clean light started to flash. Not sure if you just ignore that or have to stop and self clean it every time. But as a mom with 2 young kids I cannot just keep stopping to self clean this awful vacuum!I have a dog that does shed so thats another issue with it. All the dog hair just flys around the floor from the air coming out the front so your constantly chasing it. Also the dog hair you do collect stays on the front of the vacuum like static and you have to take that apart off later to clean it.One picky thing of mine was it doesn't have a light on it so you have to have or turn all your lights on or vacuum in the daytime.The self cleaning system is a JOKE! You have to take everything apart and wipe it all down anyways. So you have to take the brush roll top part off then the brush roll to clean behind it. You have to take the filter apart and let it dry for it to be clean which is pretty normal but i would think the brush roll would be cleaner.Needless to say I was very very disappointed with this product and will be telling everyone I know not to waste their money!",9

We‚Äôre hard on our floors, no doubt- with 2 dogs and lots of red clay, but for $300 I should be able to clean the entire desired area in 1 pass without streaks and without stopping to self-clean.Also, don‚Äôt expect to be able to use on rugs or carpet.

I was quickly let down when I unboxed the new beauty, read and followed all of the directions, knowing to fully charge before first use to realize that it wouldn‚Äôt actually charge. I called Tineco customer service immediately, their decision was to ship me a new charging station, I agreed, thinking it would be worth the wait, because surely it wouldn‚Äôt take but a few days to get it... well I have now been waiting a month for my replacement charging station and it still hasn‚Äôt arrived. I have reached out to their customer service several times, they told me the delays were due to covid, and finally received an email on Christmas Day (ironic huh?) that the charging station finally shipped. Tracking noted that it was to be delivered after the new year, further annoyed, thinking that over a week and half to ship nearly a month after my initial claim/report was filed was excessive, but again, I accepted the defeat. Well I had checked tracking Saturday, excitement returned when I realized it was due to arrive here today, but alas, after no delivered notifications arrived, I checked tracking to see that the freaking shipment is no longer affiliated with my freaking charging station. Called Tineco, they were already closed, naturally. I give up, I‚Äôm returning something that may or may not have been the best thing to ever happen to me because I am honestly just so entirely sick of looking at a $300 paperweight. After all of the frustration, my husband came home from work today with an o cedar spin mop for me instead. It already didn‚Äôt let me down and was just as amazing as all of the reviews and go clean co said it would be. Also wanted to say that I cannot honestly tell you of the suction power, overall capabilities, or battery life of this machine based on the 15 minutes I finally used it til it died out of pure defiance on Christmas... it honestly didn‚Äôt wow me, but that may or may not have been due to my biased annoyance.",12

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best christmas present I‚Äôve ever bought myself!,the United States,18-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Tineco FloorOne S3. This thing kicks major ass, IMO. I have a very large floor plan with a mix of engineered hardwoods and ceramic tiles (I believe. Maybe porcelain). I have 3 small kids and lose my mind on a daily basis trying to sweep up debris and clean spills/splatters multiple times every day. Especially around mealtime.I had been considering a Bissell, but heard a couple things that made me hesitant.  Well, I heard about this, and saw a couple comparison videos. Then it went on sale. Instead of my usual analysis paralysis, I pulled the trigger and am so glad I did!  Between all the hair my 3 girls and I shed, and all the hair and fur their dolls and ponies shed I wasn‚Äôt sure this would get the job done. But it does!  It‚Äôs lightweight. Has good forward pull. Puts down just enough fluid, but not too much. And picks up every damn crumb.I have used it every day for almost a month now. Having my sweeping and mopping done in one step is almost freaking giddily orgasmic. Now I don‚Äôt fear serving rice for dinner or giving my kids chips. Nor do I have to threaten them with the iron maiden if they make a mess. In fact, it‚Äôs so easy to use that my 5yr old can manage it too. I can get about 1800sqft of space done and still be at around 30% power left. Depending on how dirty the floors are I can get everything done without having to refill or empty the tanks. The cleaning solution that comes with it smells so dang good, but not overbearingly so (I get migraines from strong scents). And my floors FEEL cleaner afterwards. My husband even noticed they feel different and he generally never notices anything having to do with cleaning.Also, mine S3 appears to charge very quickly. I use it several times a day and never have had an issue.Please note, as awesome as this is, you may still need to sweep/wipe out tight corners. My half bath has a space between the toilet and the wall that is too narrow for this to fit. It does have suction that helps with lint/hair/fur at the baseboard edges, but for heavier stuff you may still need to sweep it out a bit. It‚Äôs never been a big issue for me though.  I am SUPER anal about my floors and this machine leaves me super satisfied.Also note, this will NOT scrub grout. Nothing will. Not even this. It will clean it, but not scrub it.",9

We have had many floor scrubbers and we like this one the best. We raise dogs for a living so we use it multiple times a day. The problem is with the electrical supply. One of the units burned out the contacts. The second one we have now has stopped charging. They were very good to work with but I really want one that stays working.

I was in love the first two months until the day it stopped sucking and started er.. to suck.. in the sense of ‚Äú well this sucks‚ÄùThe vacuum motor would not come on and it would leave the floor wet. Tried all the suggested albeit limited troubleshooting tips to correct this to no avail. Finally after sending the information via email to the factory, I received a response to take video, document it through their warranty portal. Repeat this process a couple of times and then was informed that they would be sending me a new machine but not until I packaged and sent them the malfunctioned unit. Of course they would pay shipping, but I had thrown the box out and was in the process of selling my house that had wood floors throughout the entire upper story that would need to be cleaned before closing. Needless to say , I persuaded them to send me the new and I‚Äôd send the old back when I had the box. All of the correspondence was a little tough due to the country of origin and the differing written dialect but worked out in the end. Got a new machine a week after the deal was finalized. Fast forward to now. 7 months after the second machine was received, it has also died. The fact that sucks the most is- it‚Äôs unexpected and when your floors are dirty, you grab it off the charger and turn it on then disappoint immediately sets in. It was working the last time you used it then nothing. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with this cleaner. For $300 bucks, 2 machine failures and having to go back to the old fashioned cleaning method, I‚Äôd do it over without having discovered  this revolutionary cleaning machine and stick with the basics but unfortunately I‚Äôve been spoiled for the last 9 months and may not be able to turn back.

It leaves about an inch of untouched space on edges. The suction power is amazing and it can take on some heavy duty messes but it will not do edges. I also feel like for the price I shouldn‚Äôt have to be changing water as often. I wanted to love this vac so much. I do love it. It just doesn‚Äôt do what I was expecting it to do.

Christy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Real Review from a Real User,the United States,26-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"If you‚Äôre looking for a permanent mop/bucket substitute, this is NOT for you. I‚Äôm a mom of 4 (ages 11-17) with a dog and cat. This is great for those ‚Äúin between‚Äù deep cleanings or cleaning up a spontaneous mess on the floor. This does not get up against baseboards, doorway ledges or where cabinets meet the floor (kitchen, bathroom, etc). There‚Äôs about a 2 inch ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù area on the sides and front of the brush head that will not be cleaned.I‚Äôm keeping this for 2 reasons:1. I love how easy it is to grab it and zip it around to do my quick cleanups. It‚Äôs simple to use and simple to clean the unit afterwards - just give the detachable pieces a quick rinse and let dry. The slower you move this, the cleaner the area. Don‚Äôt go too fast or you‚Äôll pass over general smudges on the floor.2. The amount of time I save is incredible. While I can‚Äôt use this as a substitute to deep cleaning, I‚Äôm not having to do those as often. The floors aren‚Äôt soaked and they dry very quickly. Since this ‚Äúsweeps‚Äù as it mops, I can have my kitchen and living room done (swept, mopped and DRY) in about 20 minutes. Sure beats filling the sink up with solution/hot water and going back and forth with a mop and then making everyone stay off the floors for another 30 minutes or so until fully dried. Plus, using this to maintain the floors, makes a deeper cleaning not as bad and definitely not as often. Get this! Don‚Äôt get rid of the mop and bucket, but definitely get this.If you‚Äôre looking for a negative point, I‚Äôd say it would be how often I had to do the self cleaning mode in the beginning. BUT, I‚Äôve found that the cleaner the floors, the longer between self cleanings you‚Äôll have to do. So expect the first couple of times to take a while but once you get to where you‚Äôre using this every 3-5 days, those self cleanings will be fewer and far between. If you think every 3-5 days is a bit too often to clean your floors, you‚Äôll enjoy the ‚Äúresults in minutes‚Äù aspect so much and won‚Äôt mind cleaning more often. (It takes longer to do the dishes!) I haven‚Äôt had an issue with battery life and I‚Äôm contemplating getting a second roller just to have. And while the cleaning solution seems to be difficult to find, it smells really good.So if you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôve compared this with other brands and models, keep researching until you‚Äôre comfy. I wish I could‚Äôve been able to afford one of the newer models, but I felt this was appropriate for the money and honestly, I‚Äôm pretty satisfied with it. I‚Äôd be willing to fork out the extra money if this actually did the deep cleanings that we all have to do by getting up against baseboards - maybe have a rotating brush on the sides and front for those untouchable areas. Hope this helps.",7
Nancy H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's BEAUTIFUL!!,the United States,24-Apr-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited when I received this.  I've been using the Bissell CrossWave for the past 2-3 years and loved it for the first year but now it's not performing effectively so I decided to try Tineco iFloor3.  First off, it's BEAUTIFUL.  I love the sleek design and how modern it looks.  It's light enough that it can easily be moved from one room to another.  The buttons are in the right spot and it's so cool to see them light up.  So space aged :-).  It practically moves by itself so there is very little effort when washing your floor.  And, it seems to do a good job vacuuming and washing the floor.  I only wish the tanks were larger. Tineco - why did you make the tank so small; it's hard to fill and it empties too fast. I have a lot of area to clean and it's not convenient to need to refill the cleaning tank right in the middle of washing the floors; it doesn't hold much liquid.  And, the battery only lasts about 20 minutes yet it takes 4 hours to charge. I think this would be perfect for a small kitchen or condo or any smaller job.  The floor area I need to clean is over 1200 sq feet so I don't think this little machine is going to work out for me.  I REALLY want to keep it so I'm trying to decide if I can do part of the floors one day and more the next.  I'll have to say this, I used the Bissell Crosswave in my kitchen and then used the Tineco over the same area and the Tineco picked up more dirt.I would recommend this 100% if you don't need it for a very large area.  Still undecided but I would love to keep it if I can figure out how I can get all the flooring cleaned in a timely way.",7

I was waiting and waiting and never received it. When I checked back with them they acted like this was never a thing and that I was not going to get one since I received a refund.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice but has its flaws,the United States,8-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôve had the Tineco S3 for a few weeks now and it‚Äôs been a great addition to our home - it cuts down on floor cleaning time and the amount of energy I usually spend on the floors. However, it has its issues which (in my opinion) does not allow it to live up to its $400 price tag. I live in a 1200 sqft apartment in NYC and have two dogs. One of my dogs has pretty fine hair which apparently doesn‚Äôt work too well with this vacuum. As soon as that fur gets wet, it sticks to the floor and it takes quite a few passes to suck it up into the vacuum. The vacuum would also be annoying to have in a large home. The water tank has barely just enough space to clean my top floor. Then I have to refill, self clean and empty the dirty water tank before I can move on to the second floor and then repeat the process. The maintenance of the vacuum has become another chore in itself. I would actually have actually loved its self cleaning mechanisms if I didn‚Äôt have to do it ~3 times every use. Overall, it is an upgrade from my old routine but I definitely would not buy it at full price if I had to do it again.",6
3Rivers K9,2.0 out of 5 stars,Quit working after 10 days,the United States,29-May-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the Floor One S3 to clean the 2800 sqr ft of tile in our home.  The unit takes a bit to get set up and charged and the CWT/DWT clean&dirty water tanks are fairly small requiring them to need refilling & dumping often.  Additionally the clean up process takes 15-20 mins each time the machine is used, however all of this is acceptable, as is the cleaning performance.Unfortunately the dang thing stopped working after the third use.  It will run for apprx. 3-5 secs then it stops and the power indicator flashes.  The instruction manual that came with the unit indicates that this ""problem"" is a ""motor malfunction"" contact customer support.When one calls their well hidden CS number the message over the last 4 days I've called says they are experiencing ""tech"" issues with their phone service and they are working on it.  If you hang in there you will actually get someone in the Philippines, once again.  The last person I spoke with this morning 5.29.20 had a dog barking in the background, which made the already difficult conversation more difficult & FRUSTRATING!!!!!WHEN it works the cleaner does a good job, but like others, I have found dealing with their customer service to be a 1/4 star at best.Buyer/s be ware.",9

My husband tracked mud all over the house and didn't clean it up right away. He let it sits overnight to dry so I can test this little machine out.I was skeptical at first because let's face it...they always show cleaning an already cleaned floor, or maybe a fresh mess but never DRIED MUCK. But this machine proved to be a miracle. Not only does it vacumn all the dust and hair, it mops and dry!!! It is not a complete dry, but when I walked over the freshly mopped floor, I didn't leave any tracks on it, so that's good enough for me!This machine is magical!",11

It took nearly 3 weeks to come in, the clean water tank had water inside, and no cleaning solution came also the box had a cut out which I believe was from a previous send, I emailed the company about this but decided to still try the product, I charged it bit it kept showing the tangled icon, after further inspection I saw one of the clips was broken! They definitely sent me a refurbished product that wasn't even refurbished properly for $200, I sent a return through Amazon and I am hoping the new product they send me is worth $200!

I tried contacting the company by their phone number and it immediately puts you on hold listening to elevator music and no one responds to email ever!. At first I thought I wasn't getting a response due to the holidays, but, now it's 1/25/20 and I just attempted to call again and again it went to the elevator music and never got a person.

Blake,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great cleaning product but, misses the mark due to design flaws",the United States,18-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I WAS really excited to get this product after reading the reviews on this site and others, it seemed like it was everything I wanted...Pros:1. It does provides a deep cleaning compared to a mop or disposable pad cleaning devices. I cleaned my floors before hand and then used the this product to see if it cleaned more which it did. I was actually really impressed and disgusted at the same time with how well it cleaned the floors.  I do recommend it for deep cleaning purposes (in addition to a mop).2. The vacuum suction is great as well.Cons:1. As stated in the description the average battery life is 18-23 minutes however, this is not sufficient time to clean any room. 18 minutes for max cleaning and 23 for eco cleaning. But, who wants to use the eco function?!?2. It takes 4 hours between each full use to be able to use again for another 20 minutes. 90% of my house is tile and after 2 full days I‚Äôm only 50% finished cleaning my house.3. Within 5-7 minutes the self cleaning icon starts to flash, meaning you need to place it on it‚Äôs charging base to clean the roller, otherwise it will just spread the dirt accumulated on the roller across your floor. Mind you it does not charge during this process so it‚Äôs reduces the battery life and the time that you have available to clean your floors.4. There is a major design flaw! This is not edge to edge (front to back or side to side) it will not clean near a baseboard or any other object within approximately 1 inch regardless of you approach the area head on or from the side (see photo).5. It does not clean the grout very well between tile. Nor does it buff out scuff marks or caked on dirty area (even with multiple passes).Overall: I think that this device does a great job of cleaning the hard surfaces after you mop the floors. However this will not replace your mop or other clean interior tools. The battery life is not efficient to clean your house in 1 day. For the price point you are better off buying a wet/dry mop that is corded, in ordered to clean your entire house.",4
Kelsi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Six months later...here's the scoop,the United States,13-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I love my tineco. Three kids, a big dog and a house with nothing but wood floors. Swiffer wetjet just pushes the mess around and you have to vacuum separately first. So let's talk about the downsides....-You will go through a lot of cleaning solution even just using a cap's worth per fill.  I use my tineco once every two days on average and I went through three bottles in six months. You can't get this through amazon because it's back-ordered so you have to order from their website and pay shipping.-Mine stopped working out of nowhere a few weeks ago the process to get a new one under their warranty has been HORRIBLE.  I had to send them a video with super strict size requirements showing them that their machine truly was broken.  I had to download a special app to make a video that demonstrated I had tried everything they required but would keep the video size small enough. Then they sent me a label and said ship it back and when we get it we will give you a new one.  Except they didn't send packaging materials.  $27 later I had the right size box and packaging that met their label's requirement. Customer service will not take your call you have to communicate strictly via email.  It took me a whole month to get the replacement and lots of emails from their ""customer care"" in broken English.-It stinks! If you don't clean out the catch bin really good every time and constantly change the filter it gets an odor to it.I love the machine, it's great for muddy, sticky messes but customer care needs an overhaul.",5

Also does not clean as well , I do have a tineco vacuum I like but this was a mistake , only reason for any stars it‚Äôs self propelled though it‚Äôs computer and clogging issues almost had me throw it out , I guess if you baby it and conform to its needs then you may like it but the alphabot  puts a smile on my face every time yet this tineco3 gets me upset every time , it has an issues every time I use it , the alphabot no issues and put a smile on my face every time and anyone around that hears it talking though it is a bit heavier cause it can do more has larger bins easy to take out and put back and not self propelled was a pleasure. Wish I could return this tineco3, I threw out it‚Äôs box because of all the positive reviews and my tineco3 vacuum works great , maybe the top of the line model works better though the way the water and dirty water bins you have to click in perfect or it don‚Äôt work is enough for me to not even want to try it and the clogging issue , if you like this you don‚Äôt know any better that‚Äôs all I have to say it‚Äôs just a status symbol and a terrible one at that, I constantly have dirty water puddles on the floor from it clogging and when it cleans it shuts off after putting water on roller 5 times before it starts working water leaks all over there , this tineco3 is more work then something that just works all the time like the alphabot with a smile , it‚Äôs been about 4 months now with the tineco3 and the aggravation had me right this review ,it does not clean good a specially near wall or corners .  I know tineco can do better , it‚Äôs like they never tested it in real world just made something that looks good , the alphabot blows this away in every aspect but self propelled, it‚Äôs a bit louder for has more suction, it‚Äôs get the job done ,",3

I take care of my 9 year old as well as my mom with dementia so I need something to make my life easier where possible. First day I got it, I was so happy and mad I waited to long, BUT Not even a month later, it keeps prompting me to self clean even though I have, multiple times. Took it apart, air dry, try again the next day. Wipes it down with a damp cloth. Switched out parts for clean etc. Tried it without solution. Everything!  Emailed, no response. Called and finally talked to someone and unfortunately none of the resets helped. We emailed back and forth with me sending the same info and pics etc.  So now not only am I out 400$, I have to find someone to come sit with my mom to go buy a box, and ship via fedex. They couldn‚Äôt mail me a label, nor box. I‚Äôm a little pissed this new machine has to be sent to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù and sending the machine back.

So, I finally broke down and spent the money.Pictures don‚Äôt lie.  Not sure they do justice to what this machine picked up!  I dust mopped fur and dirt FIRST!  But, the second pic shows even more fur this machine picked up!!  It took three tanks and 80% battery to wash about 2,000 sf.  The dirty water was a slurry of mud and fur!  Inspected the roller after and thought it was pretty clean but when I ran the clean cycle, that water was almost as disgusting!!  Now, the floors LOOK and FEEL SO CLEAN!!!Only one capful for cleaner is added per clean water tank.  No Streaking!  Floors dried in less than five minutes!!WILL update.",5

The battery life isn‚Äôt phenomenal, but it‚Äôll get my whole house done in a single charge. The best thing that sets this apart is the ability to detect and work with wet messes as you would dry messes. It has app and self cleaning function with it. The dual function with medium size cleaning tank saves the need for multiple devices. Overall I am impressed with the vacuum.

The water tanks are too small as well. I have to constantly keep emptying and filling the tanks. The roller is too soft, it should have some stiff bristles mixed in with the soft material.

A. Arango,2.0 out of 5 stars,"O-Cedar Mop better value, or Steam Mop",the United States,19-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"First off, like SO MANY OTHERS, I read the negative reviews and the positive ones.Positive:1)  It does clean the areas it can't reach. It does have a sleek design.Negative:1)  How are you going to use this behind the toilets? It won't fit.2) The roller will always leave an inch gap against the walls, where it will not clean. It's annoying to see that inch of just dirt. (I'm not paying $300, to use a microfiber cloth to make up for that)3) I don't need another app on my phone to operate a mop I have to push myself. If this was a vacuum self robot, then I understand the app idea.4) THIS IS THE BIGGEST ONE - You need at least a 10% charge to remain at the end of your mopping in order for the self cleaning to work. The charging takes FOREVER just for 10%. So, imagine this, you mop the areas you need, and you're assuming it's going to be 30min of a job right? Well....if you get below 10%, you're going to have to wait about 30minutes for the battery to charge past 10% for self cleaning to work. I don't know about you, but I want a machine that cuts down on time.5) I got the O-Cedar Mop, that thing is 30 times better, so is any steam mop that is around $1006) I did email Tineco customer support, and they could not give me a straight answer, they wanted me to send them a video with the problem - 3 days later.

Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible hard floor cleaning,the United States,20-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"With a cat, dog, and three kids we needed a better floor cleaning system than a cordless stick vacuum.  The S3 is beyond what I thought could be accomplished with a mop/vac.  It truly cleans the floors and does it with ease.  The S3 is well built, powerful, sturdy, and intelligent.  It auto senses dirtier spots and turns up the cleaning power.  My floors have never been cleaner.Before filling it up,  take a few minutes to understand how to take it apart and put it together.  That way you don't have anxiety when you have a tub of dirty water and the S3 is telling you to clean its dirt chute.  For people with long hair animals (mine is great pyrenees--he's a giant furball)  take time after every cleaning to pull up the roller and clean the chute behind it where fur collects.  Things like large pieces candy wrappers will also get stuck in this area.  It is easily cleaned out using your fingers.  I have only had one complete clog where I sectioned up a large clump of fur and it was too much fur at once for the machine to suction.  The S3 stopped and said it needed cleaning.The S3 comes with cleaning solution.  A tiny capful is all thats needed per fill up.  The floors look great!  I was hesitant to buy due to never owning a combination vac/mop and the $400 price point.  I do own an older model Tineco stick vac that still works great, so I know the company makes reliable products.If you can afford to buy the S3 I strongly recommend it.  Its such a huge improvement from regular vacuuming and the floors look much better.",8

The results are downright spectacular and it‚Äôs pretty easy to use. That being said, it‚Äôs almost like the AI still needs refinement. The original Tineco that I purchased kept shutting down and telling me to ‚Äúempty dirty water tank or clean debris channel‚Äù over and over and over once it hit 73% battery. I contacted the company and they wanted me to send it in for repair. It was brand new and expensive, so I returned that one to Amazon instead and am giving a 2nd machine a try.  Now the new one I have tells me to run the auto cleaning cycle over and over and over even when I just started using it. So, either there are some design flaws or I keep purchasing lemons.

I try to just purchase a new cord from website and it's been out of stock For a while. Comes to show you how many power cords stop working. So now I have a $300 vacuum mop that's just sitting there.

M. Holman,5.0 out of 5 stars,This machine is a dream for a household with animals and children!,the United States,1-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I rarely ever mopped my floors before buying this vacuum (maybe once every few months). Ever since I've had the Tineco Floor One S3, I cannot stand for my floors to have a spot on them! It cleans so thoroughly!! I didn't realize what I was missing out on until I got this vacuum. AND no more having to use a million paper towels or old towels to clean up messes made by my 2 children or my 2 large dogs! I just whip out this guy and it's clean in just a few minutes. It's so light and SUPER easy to maneuver - it feels like I'm vacuuming with a traditional lightweight non-bulky vacuum.  It powers up so quickly that I can use it for little spills or spots really quickly without any hassle. I LOVE the self-cleaning feature. I just put the vacuum on the charger and press the self-clean function and BOOM it cleans itself! I just have to empty the dirty water tank into the sink. Maintenance is super easy too! Run self-cleaning cycle, dump and rinse out the dirty water tank, refill clean water tank with water and a capful of the cleaning solution, and once a week I take out the roller brush and filter and deep clean them by hand. However, an extra roller brush and extra filter come with the vacuum so no waiting on the other ones to dry! Plus the storage base has places to hold the extra filter and roller brush so they can air dry and be easily stored in a convenient place! Oh and don't be scared off by the 30 min battery life or the size of the tanks. I can clean my entire kitchen/back hall/laundry room/guest bath (approx 1,000 sqft) on one battery charge and only 2-3 dirty water tank emptying or clean water tank refills. Which is about the same amount times I'd have to change mop water but this way I'm not having to lift a heavy bucket. Oh did I mention the ""smart"" feature?! It tells you if the floor is dirty! Then it speeds up or slows down depending on the amount of dirt and it tells you when it's cleaned! Amazing!!! I am truly in love with this vacmop! It is worth EVERY PENNY. Stop guessing if you should buy it and JUST BUY IT! You won't be sorry.",3

BUT if you have pets with long hair, id skip over this. i vacuum prior to using the tineco and still it gets clogged up with hair after doing a small area. also, the water tanks are small, leaving them to need refilled pretty quickly. another thing to consider is if you have textured floors. i have textured vinyl plank flooring and it definitely does not leave my floors clean like i saw people claim on tiktok. and now, within 3 months of buying this $300 machine it is broken. so we will see how easy the customer service and the warranty process is....... needless to say i cannot say i recommend this product",3

After you're done cleaning put some white socks on and I hope you feel as satisfied as I did after I slid all over my floors and my socks were still WHITECONS- I wish I would've known about this machine before I purchased the DYSON I HATE!!!!!!! I could've gotten this machine and TINECO VACUUM which I'm sure if its anything like this machine.....it SLAYS- DUMPING OUT AND REFILLING TINECO SOLUTION.......(NOT A CON FOR ME but is for my brother) I have about 1200 sq. ft. worth of tile on the first floor and please note I also have 3 dogs 2 pitbulls and a lab/german mix so lots of dog hairs, I use my machine on the entire first floor every 2-3 days so when I'm cleaning I probably have to stop to dump out the dirty water and clean or swap the rollers about 2-3 times. This doesn't take very long and I don't mind it cause at least I'm not slushing dirty water all over the place as my son is now crawling everywhere. PLEASE NOTE: If- WARRANTY IS VOID is you use any other solution other than TINECO CLEANING SOLUTION**OVERALL**I suggest the first time you clean take your time and go slow, let the machine glide and guide you so you can get a deep clean. In general I love this machine and it makes cleaning a breeze. Well made, well put together, customer service is awesome, and I just wish I had known about this sooner. Needless to say I can't wait for my girlfriends to get pregnant, this definitely should be on everyones BABY REGISTRY!! <3 <3 <3 <3THANK YOU TINECO for making life A LOT easier for this first time mom. <3 LOYAL TINECO CUSTOMER FOR LIFE. <3",2
Elissa Pierce,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Leaking and Broken Roller, STINKS - Less Than A Year Old",the United States,12-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"The roller no longer snaps in properly and now it will suck up larger things more easily which then clog the machine. It leaks water everywhere while in use. I have been fairly good about cleaning it out after each use, occasionally I won't clean it right away because i only used it for a quick spill clean up and I will be cleaning my floors later in the day. It stinks permanently now, I have even tried using lysol to wash the roller and parts but it still smells like musty water. The cleaner it comes with is okay, it smells nice but it doesn't deep clean. Also using anything except the tineco cleaner voids the warranty which is BS because like I said the machine stinks after only using the tineco cleaner because it is not strong enough.TL:DR Not worth $300, MAYBE worth $150",3
J. smith,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So Far: good cleaner, but water tanks way to small",the United States,31-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This is an ""out of the box"" review which I'll update in 6 months or so.  I've had literally a couple of dozen hard floor scrubbers over my years of breeding Cavaliers from inexpensive Hoover Floormates up to an $1100 Clark ""commercial"" model and quite frankly have found all to be lacking.  With that said, I'll review this product fresh out of the box and will adjust up or down on the rating as time goes by.THINGS I LIKE SO FAR:  Light weight, cordless, the self cleaning feature does a pretty good job of keeping machine clean and fresh, brush doesn't tangle with hair (HUGE for me with all the dog hair), Cleans relatively well and has a ""Max"" power mode for stubborn grime, much quieter than any other machine I've had to date, long enough run time to get me through the 650 sq ft that I routinely clean one to two times per day, very maneuverable and I can get in, around and under (low profile) all the toys and apparatus of puppyland and I can get under many of the areas I couldn't clean without moving in the adult dog area.THINGS I DON'T LIKE SO FAR:  My biggest complaint and the thing that really knocks a couple of stars off the rating is the size of the clean and dirty water tanks.  I have to constantly refill the clean water and empty the dirty water tanks throughout the aforementioned daily cleaning routine.  Both tanks should be 3X bigger.  It is very annoying to having to keep running back and forth to the tap to dump and refill tanks is a big issue, the fact that you have to use the mfg cleaning solution (not that it does a bad job, but I will constantly have to make certain I have a generous supply on hand as I have to order from Amazon and allow plenty of time for delivery), and although I like that it cleans itself, it will have you running back to either replenish the clean water tank or dump the dirty water tank after you are done cleaning, and the VOICE......UGH.....it jabbers all the time!  It never stops talking to you whether it is alerts to clean dirty water tank, fill clean water tank, start self clean, max mode, auto mode, replace appliance on charger (often when not needed), shutting off.  It is a total NAG!  Just give me an indicator light for those instances and stop TALKING!  Although this seems like a small complaint, it really is very annoying!So, that is my take on the new machine.  We'll see how well it performs over time.  I've found that most cleaners work well ""out of the box"" but don't stand up to daily use.  We'll see.  Updates to come.",3
R&GMom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!  Surpassed expectations!,the United States,14-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I had previously purchased the Bissell CrossWave¬Æ Cordless Max Multi-Surface Wet Dry Vac which is similar to this Tineco iFloor3.  The Bissell CrossWave¬Æ Cordless Max was horrible and I returned it after using it one time.  Because of that experience, I was very hesitant to order this Tineco iFloor3. But I've ended up with my arm in a cast for 10 weeks and really needed something since my little Swiffer push stick mop was almost impossible for me to use.So I took a chance and ordered this Tineco iFloor3 and used it for the first time today. Wow, I'm extremely impressed! The Tineco iFloor3 is very lightweight and highly maneuverable which is very important to me right now since I am down to one hand/arm for a couple of months.  I could easily push it around our extensive footage of hard floors with one hand and it did an excellent job cleaning, better than I can do with just the little Swiffer stick wet mop pads.  Plus it was fast! I did not have to go very slowly in order for it to clean well; basically as quickly as I could push it, it would clean the floor well, particularly on the Max setting.The battery life also surprised me. I cannot vacuum both my sunroom and kitchen with my Bissel cordless vacuum without running out of battery power before I can finish the 2 rooms. With this Tineco iFloor3, I was able to wash the floors of both the sunroom and kitchen, laundry room, and powder room and still had charge left.  Definitely impressive and a very nice surprise!I was skeptical about both the floor cleaning solution that comes with this Tineco iFloor3 and the self-cleaning cycle but I am pleased with both. I usually prefer to use simply water with vinegar and alcohol for my floor cleaning solution to avoid streaks, but just using water and the Tineco solution did a good job cleaning without leaving streaks so I‚Äôm happy with it. Also, the self-cleaning cycle was easy to use and did a great job. I took the roller out and washed it under running water after the self-cleaning cycle just in case, but the roller was already very clean from the self-cleaning cycle.As always, there are a few cons. You cannot tip it flat to get under chairs/tables and it does not fit under the toe-kick in my kitchen.  But the pluses of this Tineco iFloor3 far outweigh its cons, so I can live with having to touch up underneath those areas with the Swiffer stick mop pads .  It would also be nice if the clean and dirty water tanks were a little bit larger so you can go longer without having to refill the clean water tank and empty the dirty water tank, but of course that would increase the weight and decrease the maneuverability so maybe if I had to choose, I would stay with these smaller water tanks so that the weight stays lighter.Overall, at this time I highly recommend the Tineco iFloor3.  Time will tell how long it last before having problems at which time I will find out how Tineco‚Äôs customer service is, but with first use I‚Äôm very pleased with this floor washing unit and hope it will remain trouble free for a long time.",3

Unfortunately it stopped working within a year of owning it. I reached out to customer support on July 19th and was told to ship the whole vacuum back to them (so keep your box in case this happens to you!!) and they determined that the motor broke and they would be sending me a new unit, which I received on August 31st . Awesome! Except the new unit was filthy, clearly used, and the clean water tank was broken. I emailed them immediately (with the pictures in this review) and was told they would be sending a new clean water tank and would supply the shipping information when they ship it. Still waiting... super frustrated.",3

I would turn it on, it would spin and then shut off but the next time I‚Äôd try it would work. Cleaned and took care of it according to the instructions. Well, today, it did it again but this time would not turn on past that and started dumping water everywhere. I looked up the troubleshooting for it and tried for 30 or so minutes to figure it out but ultimately ended up coming on here to figure out how to fix it. I saw that I was eligible to return it, thankfully. I‚Äôm so appreciative of Amazon and their return policies. It really protects us consumers who spend a fortune on products. This mop was THE BOMB, when it was working. But I took great care of it and it‚Äôs unfortunate that it just stopped after less than 7 months with it.Returned my crosswave for this as so many others have! Worth it! This thing is amazing! I use it daily! Functional, easy, cleans well!",4
Abel MAGANA,3.0 out of 5 stars,Less cleaning time and much less effort,the United States,13-Jun-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I used to vacuum the floor and then mop it using a Bissell steam mop, the result is good but it demands effort and besides that if the floor is too dirty the steam mop acts just like a normal mop that really doesn't pick up all the grime. Now that I have been at home because of the quarantine I have had time to search the Internet for better options, I decided to buy the Bissell CrossWave Cordless Max Multi-Surface, I placed the order but later I received a response message that that model was out of stock, since I had already made the decision to buy I then moved to Tineco, which was my second option, and how happy I feel because of that. This machine really rocks. At the beginning I was getting streaking on the floor but I realized that it happened because the floor was too dirty for the machine to clean it completely on the first pass, the result I got later after two or three more uses is just incredible, our ceramic floor has never been so clean and with so little effort.As other review says once the floor is cleaned, it's just maintenance what is needed, the cleaning time is reduced and also the battery and the cleaning water solution last longer because the machine automatically adjust the cleaning power that is needed according to how dirty is the water that is being suctioned up. I'm so glad with Tineco that I now want to buy one of the Tineco vacuum sticks but I'm waiting for a discount or good offer.I'm trying now to clean the grout on my floor, the first attempt this morning was to apply grout cleaner directly on the floor and let it stay for a while before using the Tineco machine to pick up the dirt. The result is quit good.07/01/2020As some reviewers mention the machine is not able to clean the floor closer than 1 inch to the wall (actually on the right side the unclean strip is around 1"" and on the left side is about 1.5"" see my picture). There is a Karcher FC5 machine capable to clean right to the edge but the cleaning roller is split by half and the video reviews on YouTube show that the final performance is not good. I consider this as a minor limitation on the Tineco machine since the overall performance  is fantastic.10/28/20 FIRST PROBLEMAfter only five months of usage the Tineco Floor One S3 has started to not charging the battery or even though the battery appears to be 100% charged the charge doesn't last the same as before. I found out that the problem may be due to a corrosion on the electrical contacts that connect the appliance to the charging base (see the picture), which looks to me like a design flaw since on the base that part is covered by a flap and on the Floor One contacts seems to be not exposed to humidity.  I cleaned the contacts the best I could with a scotch brite pad but would like to find a better solution for the problem.",3

I really didn‚Äôt think it would work so well. I was trying to choose between the Bissell or the Tineco. I currently own an older version of the Bissell and my floors always have a film and are still dirty. Like I clean them and if I do a wipe it still has a brown tinge to the paper towel. I used the Tineco and did a wipe test and nothing. I used a dry and a wet paper towel for the test and I was blown away. I also want to preface that this is even more amazing in my home because I have three dogs, a cat and a toddler in my house. I am constantly cleaning. I love too that it‚Äôs almost like a self propelled lawn mower it pulls itself forward so maneuvering is really easy. It doesn‚Äôt leave much of any water around. Picks up most of the fur.

My kid likes to draw on my floors with chalk (I know it‚Äôs an easy clean up with a rag etc) this thing gets it up with little to no effort. The only downside of this for me would be the fact it has a small water tank. I have a huge 2 story house and I have to refill between rooms which isn‚Äôt a problem I just wish it was bigger.

Tiffany,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's Time You Upgraded your Swiffer Sweeper & Enter the Adult 2.0 League of Cleanliness,the United States,22-Oct-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Damn, can we just appreciate some cleaning tool technology feats here? It's a wet mop & vacuum that's perfect for hardwood floors...& it's cordless! AMAZING. If the thought of a really clean kitchen floor turns you on, buy this vacuum. But look, I get it. This thing is pricey, especially if you're a millennial with a somewhat decent paying job & student loans to pay off. Why spend your hard-earned cash on a vacuum/mop combo when a Swiffer Sweeper Wetjet seems like it should be good enough? For those who are fortunate enough to have disposable income they haven't YOLO'd into GME, it's time for you to upgrade from that Swiffer to a Tineco. It'll change your life & you will have absolutely NO RAGRATS.Clean-up is so easy with this bad boy. It's sleek, lightweight, & astonishingly easy to use & clean. Yes, you have to clean the cleaning tool. Welcome to adulthood, don't be lazy, it's necessary to maintain the integrity of the vacuum.This is the perfect tool for apartments or houses with hardwood or tiled floors. However, I will say that while this vacuum is fantastic at cleaning & sucking up things in open spaces, it fails to suction up debris near edges or walls. The suction isn't powerful enough (even on max) to grab things right near a wall. My recommendation is to sweep any spilled messes to the middle of the floor & then go HAM. If you spill soil from your plants, that won't be a problem to suction up, but if you try to suction up foliage--such as palm leaves or dead leaves--just don't. Sweep those things up, y'all--they're not meant to be vacuumed. Other than that, it's a 10/10 would recommend.If you're deciding between a Dyson or this Tineco, you're comparing different tools for different jobs. Think about what you really need to clean (kitchen where there's wet things or carpet, stairs, & mostly dry yuckies) & then make a decision. This vacuum/mop combo is fantastic for kitchen, bathroom, & living room cleanups. This doesn't mean it's not good for suctioning up dry mess, it just means you shouldn't be using it on carpets because the roller brush will just spread dirt all over it.The autoclean mechanic works great, making clean up a breeze. Dump out the dirty water tank in your sink & bin the chunkier debris. The battery charges pretty quickly & you get a solid battery life before it dies. If you're spending more than 35 minutes vacuuming, your house is either way too filthy or just way too enormous (must be nice). As a wet vacuum, this is one of the best cleaning tools to have in your arsenal & it is a DELIGHT to use. The suction is so powerful that it practically drives itself (again, with the exception of edges). Dried spills easily come away when you roll over them SLOWLY a few times.If you have a lot of carpet in the house or rugs or you need to clean a lot of stairs & this is your main concern, go with a Dyson. They're the best vacuums on the market with the best suction & you can convert them into a smaller handheld vacuum to get those hard-to-reach spots & stairs.Overall, I wouldn't go so far as to say that this product will replace any vacuum you have, especially if your vacuum has the ability to be converted to a smaller unit to grab small messes, but it will replace your mop! Upgrade your crappy mop, y'all. It's time you got a Tineco.",One

He is uber particular and snotty about his bamboo hardwood floors being cleaned.

Amy Robertson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Takes on 2 Toddlers and 2 Dogs Like a Champ,the United States,5-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôm absolutely in love with this machine. My expectations were definitely exceeded. We have a 5,200 sq ft house, and it is almost all hardwood floors. We have two toddlers and two dogs. The mess is substantial...and sticky.If you are considering buying this, here are some things you may want to know:- The voice instructions are really nice. This machine will audibly tell you exactly what it needs. It is super smart, and takes the guesswork out of figuring out where there is a clog or why it isn‚Äôt working as well as usual.- The battery length is impressive. I can do my entire house (5,200 sq ft at a relatively slow pace) and still have some battery left.- This auto-propels forward. I underestimated how nice this is. Makes the effort that much less.- The auto clean cycle makes your job easy, but I do have to run it a few times during a cleaning session. Before starting a self cleaning cycle, make sure you have enough clean water in the tank and enough space in the dirty water tank otherwise it will make you start the whole cycle over again.- Run with the grain of your floor. This seems obvious to me, but there are some complaints about streaking in the reviews. Solves the problem completely. I get a beautiful shiny floor every time.- For the best clean, slow down a little bit. My husband uses this like he is racing the clock. It gives a nice clean, but when you slow down just a bit, you notice the best results.- Works on tile as well, but I think of it more as a refresh in our bathrooms. It isn‚Äôt going to get down to the grout like a mop. I still do a proper cleaning with some stronger cleaning products where we have tile.- Also works to refresh your low pile rugs. I had no expectation of this making any noticeable difference on my rugs. However, very pleasantly surprised.- It comes with a bottle of Tineco cleaning solution. It is a very light and good smell. The bottle has lasted me about 2+ months with near everyday use.- Empty the water tanks every time! It does not take long for the tank to smell musty. I think this would be the case when any similar product, but it is a pain when I‚Äôve forgotten to empty. I run a few cleaning cycles in a row and the issue is fixed.Overall, 10/10 recommend. Our Tineco has handled some pretty significant messes. I anticipated pulling the mop and bucket out for a ‚Äúreal clean‚Äù at least once a week still, but it has been 2 months and I haven‚Äôt had to do it.

jesredneck98,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pet hair, dust, farm dirt, or baking flour it gets it all!",the United States,9-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"SEE the picture it will pick up all your pet hair! This machine was on my mind as a purchase for a month before I actually bought one. I have many reasons to buy one. I am a farmer in Wisconsin so we experience all seasons on top of that I also bake and decorate cookies out of my home kitchen. I have a dog who sheds all year, a three year old cat and two kittens so there‚Äôs no shortage of pet hair. All rooms are faux hardwood floor and endure pets, muddy boots, and the dreaded flour/baking powder mess in the kitchen. I have spent countless hours trying to mop daily and vacuum to keep up with the sometimes daunting mess or just the pet hair. So when I saw this product I watched videos and researched the product because at $400 it better work. Vacuuming was never enough because I also would need to mop after, plus there‚Äôs nothing more satisfying than a clean floor. Dragging a vacuum and then mop which still would leave some dirt/pet hair behind was annoying. I would have to walk around and wipe up spots with a paper towel to get what the mop didn‚Äôt pick up. So I pulled the trigger on the Tineco and haven‚Äôt looked back! It does exactly what it says! It cleans amazing and gets the job done where my stick mop doesn‚Äôt. It also washes the floor so it solves the problem of having to always use a vacuum and a mop. It‚Äôs great for everyday and it‚Äôs great for deep cleaning. The slight downfall is that the machine has a small clean and dirty water tanks. If I deep clean I am changing them often as I spend more time in each room. I am doing a general cleaning I only have to change the tanks 2-3 times which for me isn‚Äôt a huge deal, I‚Äôm usually close to the kitchen anyway. The other minor issue I have is that the cleaner for the machine doesn‚Äôt have a strong clean floor smell. There‚Äôs nothing like the smell of clean crisp floors and I really miss that about using this machine. I‚Äôm a month into using the Tineco and I‚Äôm super happy with it, it‚Äôs worth the money if you want to speed up your process and not use a vacuum and a mop as well if you have a high traffic home.",2
Sweetone,4.0 out of 5 stars,High maintenance but works well,the United States,25-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I was really excited about the Tineco and it did not disappoint; however, I‚Äôm not thoroughly impressed with every aspect. One reason I went with the newer version was because I liked that it turned red until the mess was thoroughly cleaned up. I have found this feature cannot really be relied on. I went over a little dried kitty puke and it stayed blue. It turned red in areas that already looked clean. My Husband thought it might be reacting off shadows or something. There was a high traffic area it turned red on and I was pleased with that but it‚Äôs definitely not accurate.The fact that it propels itself forward was exciting to me, it could practically run itself, just needed a little direction. Well it‚Äôs not such a fun feature when you‚Äôre pulling it back to go over areas. It gets exhausting quick, kind of reminiscent of chasing my toddler.My last gripe is that it is extremely high maintenance. A mop bucket is basically two steps for maintenance: fill up the bucket with solution and water, empty the bucket and run the mop under the sink. Done. The Tineco needs to be changed twice while doing my living area, then it needs to be changed once for its self cleaning cycle. Then everything has to be washed out thoroughly and left to dry. I didn‚Äôt know to take out the roller and after a day it smelt like mildew. So you‚Äôre thoroughly cleaning a disgusting tank, pulling out wet hairs, crumbs, etc then you are scrubbing the roller, filter, etc after every single use. My roller is currently outside because it didn‚Äôt dry over the sink overnight.All this aside, it did a killer job cleaning my floors. They are streak free and I felt excited to go over all the messes. I think I will get into a routine with it where all the things I find complicated I‚Äôll find short cuts for.  I‚Äôll update in a couple months to see if any of my thoughts have changed.",One

I wanted so much to love this but it's way overpriced for it's subpar performance. Do not buy this if you have more than one dog. I have an Aussie and her hair clogs it fairly quick. I'm still on the fence if I'm keeping it or notPros: self cleans, easy docking station, cordless, holds a charge long enough for me to mop 3 rooms, mops and vacuums at the same ame timeCons: kind of heavier than I was expecting, I have to empty the dirty water tank 2-3 times doing 3 rooms because the dog hair clogs before it's actually full, leaves an untouched 1 inch border around everything and there's no attachment to get into those spots, too expensive for the performance you get",2
Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a vacuum collector, WORTH IT.",the United States,6-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"My partner hates me. I collect vacuums thinking the next best thing will come along and improve my life.So far, I've bought a Roomba, a Dyson  v7 stick, various other cheap stick vacuums, a shark lift away. Those are just the ones I can think of. For mops, everything from a basic mop, to a Lipman refillable/washable, a spinning one.No matter what, my routine took me hours and left me exhausted. To be quite honest, I never felt swiffer/lipman mopped my floors clean either - just pushed the gross around... We rarely walk barefoot in the house because I just cant keep up. AND I MISS WALKING BAREFOOT!We have 2 dogs, and 1 (hairless) cat. That means needing to vacuum and mop constantly, like once a day minimum. With the Roomba it should've been easier but one dog attacks it and also piddles randomly (so didn't want the Roomba freeroaming on a schedule).Enter this. Man. I knew I would be in trouble for buying it and I did get the ""ANOTHER ONE?"" speech... But guess what? We now use it daily. It cut my cleaning time in literal fractions. Its easy to clean and its pretty much self propelling, so its like 0 effort to use it. I will say, the first time around I wish I vacuumed first, it clogged up a lot with the dog hair, but after that it wasn't a big deal.For comparison, I feel(but may be wrong) it has better suction power than the dyson v7 stick (go figure), and definitely better floor mopping than a swiffer wetjet(or equivalent) or a bucket and mop. I have wet the floor after and whiped with a paper towel and its still super clean after using the Tineco.I have used the included cleaning solution and it smells nice. It does leave a haze, but it also cleans well. I've also tried pure water, which also works fine.I wish when I got it I did NOT peel the sticker off the LED area - I had to put the manual on my fridge so I could readily see what it was telling me it needed. Other than that, not a big deal.I did my research and bought the iFloor3. It's pretty close to the same as the One s3 without the added cost. I felt I didnt need it talking to me, and I could keep up with the lower milliamp (mAh) battery. Although I wish I waited a week (theres a discount now, and I would've gotten the One s3). However, I can quickly clean my whole house on MAX with the 3000mAh battery, for a deep clean/messes I will need to charge a few times.It's light and easy enough to use for kids, and is a bit of fun to use, if you'd like to get them involved. I'd highly recommend this all in one floor cleaner.",One
Kayla L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just shy of 5 stars!,the United States,8-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I've had this product for 4 months now. What I really like about it: fast, cordless, easy maneuverability. What I dislike about it: cleaning the parts, suction could be a bit better, cleaning solution that comes with it.I have 3 dogs and 1 cat. One of the dogs is a husky, which sheds enough for the other three animals. This mopvac does not do the trick when it comes to picking up the husky hair. It clogs way too fast and I felt like I was clearing it out every other pass of the floor. Even though this is supposed to do the job of a mop and vacuum at the same time, I started to do a quick vacuum in the areas where my dogs hair really gathered. And that made mopping with the Tineco much easier. I know it kind of defeats the purpose, but it's still faster to do both this way than use a mop/bucket.I think if this was a larger mopvac, it may do the trick with all the animal hair. But for the most part, I love how quick I can clean the floors in my home. The rainy season has me using this just about every 2-3 days, and it cleans up the muddy paw prints perfectly. I'm curious if any other cleaning solution will work in it because the Tineco solution is a bit streaky on my floors.Overall, great product, would definitely purchase again and I've influenced several family and friends to purchase as well!",2

Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,I should have bought this a long time ago.,the United States,15-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Let me start this by saying I spent a good hour, maybe longer, reading reviews, searching online for reviews not just Amazon, and finally settled on this model. I‚Äôm so glad it did. My research paid off. Look no further - this is money well spent and I am so glad I went with this Tineco vacuum/mop.It vacuums while it mops, which is amazing to me. It‚Äôs smooth - it‚Äôs lightweight and easy to maneuver, the functions and parts on the machine are easy to empty, get on or off to empty the containers, it‚Äôs easy to charge, and it‚Äôs just made for someone who wants minimal hassle while cleaning.I feel like a sucker that I didn‚Äôt buy this sooner. I‚Äôm literally disappointed in myself that I waited this long (and the only thing keeping me from buying earlier was the price tag and wondering if it would be a good ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù since I spent a pretty penny on my regular vacuum). I only wish this could vacuum carpets or rugs in addition to the floors, but I think they have a model for that too....once again, I‚Äôm not usually so ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, but I had read so many mixed reviews on so many products that I just wanted the search process to be over with!I have hardwood floors throughout my house with tile in the kitchen and bathroom. Everything looks so great! I used a cap full of the cleaner it came with and filled it with tap water (I might use distilled later on but for my first time I didn‚Äôt). I read that you are not supposed to use any other cleaning solution except the Tineco one, and I also read that it‚Äôs hard to find... I will use the Tineco one because I see now that it works great, but also because the warranty won‚Äôt be good if I use a different cleaner in it, and I kind of want to play it safe, especially since I was hesitant to purchase because of the price and I don‚Äôt want to have to buy another one.Another major plus and determining factor for me was that it keeps the dirty water separate from the clean water. In some machines there is only one container for the water and so it sloshes around the dirty water... yuck.A major factor when purchasing was that it is cordless. The run time is not too long but I easily got the whole level of my fair-sized ranch house completed in record short time compared to prior cleanings. I did have to stop twice to empty the dirty water and refill the cleaning solution with water, but I think it is important to note that I had it on the most powerful setting (there is a ‚Äúmax‚Äù setting and a regular setting and even the more powerful setting was not very loud, but still very efficient) the entire time I was cleaning so I might have had to stop because of that.Since I did use the cleaning solution by Tineco I will add that the drying time (and I used the max setting so it was a little wetter than the regular setting) was only a few short minutes. I used to have to wait 3-4x that long when I used my ‚Äúother‚Äù mop. Seriously...why did I wait so long to buy this thing?If you found my review helpful please click the button below.

Hasmac,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute junk,the United States,27-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"We bought the Tineco one floor s3 in October 2020. Initially, it worked pretty good and did its job at its best. After 3 months the charging base wasn‚Äôt working properly so we had to put some support and keep the base crooked for it to continue charging. After 6 months the charging base completely stopped working. When we tried to contact the customer service through phone, all we can hear is a recorded response asking us to contact them through email and not phone because of the pandemic situation. So, I contacted them over the email response was they need photo and video proof and finally they themselves called us. When we tried to explain the situation, the lady on the other end was rude and asked us to send the whole product for them to check and repair it and send it back to us. She said she will send us the return label and we need to take the machine to FEdEx. Seriously, do we have that much time to wait for their product to be repaired and sent back us. Especially, when you need to clean your house everyday!!!! After spending $399 for a piece of junk from China we need to go through hell of a process to make it work again. Do you think it‚Äôs all worth it?? Please save your money and run away from this junk. Will never recommend it to anyone.",3

Its too large to get under my stove and leaves a wide margin around the egdes of my floors where it cannot get. The air it is kicking out from the suction blows around the pet hair instead of picking it up. Its great for mud season, but other than that I would have to pass on buying this machine again. The brush when removed never seems to dry. It also needs to self clean every other time I use it to clean my kitchen floor.",3
Terry in SA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spectacular at cleaning your hard floors in a very short amount of time,the United States,3-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This TINECO Floor One S3 Cordless Hardwood Floor Cleaner is spectacular at cleaning your hard floors in a very short amount of time but if you have pets or people that shed a lot of hair, it's not quite as quick and easy. (Also note that this is for hard floors only. It is not for vacuuming carpeting or rugs.)So basically, this is a floor machine that vacuums and scrubs your hard floors simultaneously, sucking up the dirty water and leaving your floors super clean. The floors dry so quickly, I wondered if it was a steam cleaner, too, but it's not. It just vacuums up the dirty water so well that there is very little left on the floor. And wow, the water in the dirty water tank is filthy! It also has a stand that also serves as a charging dock. It has easily changeable brush rollers and filters. The dirty water tank is easy to remove and clean. There is even a self cleaning cycle that cleans the brush roller very well. Basically, you only clean manually the dirty water tank and the area where the brush roller is installed and the HEPA filter, which takes very little time.It's a quality, well built, machine but the manual leaves a bit to be desired for such an expensive machine. For example, it comes with an extra roller and HEPA filter, which I assumed were to be used when the installed ones wore out. The manual doesn't really make it clear. Also, there are two accessory holders but it doesn't say where they go. (They attach to the sides of the charging stand.)The machine speaks to you - giving you status reports on the charging status, telling you when to run the self cleaning cycle, when to refill the clean water tank, when to empty the dirty water tank, etc. This is actually pretty great. And it's extremely gratifying to see how dirty the water is after cleaning. Best of all, it's super quiet and maneuvers very well. I am currently living in an apartment with mostly hard flooring and I can use this machine at night without worries of disturbing any neighbors.I was upset at first when it told me to start the self cleaning cycle after only about 10 minutes of floor cleaning. And then, I saw that the HEPA filter must be fully dry before reinstalling it in the machine after rinsing it as directed. It says the same thing about the roller brush. Then I realized THAT'S why you get an extra set included in the box!Next, I realized that hair is what clogs the dirty water tank and gets stuck on the roller brush, prompting the self cleaning cycle. I have a household that includes a couple of dogs that shed a lot and several people with very long hair. So for me, doing a quick once over with a dust mop before using this machine works much better. Less hair means I can clean the floors for much longer before I have to clean the tank and the brush roller. If you don't have pet fur or a lot of human hair to deal with, you can skip the dust mopping but if you do have pets, be ready to stop a lot unless you use this machine almost every day to keep the hair and fur to a minimum. I also ordered 2 more HEPA filters and 2 more roller brushes so I can clean the entire apartment.It comes with a cleaning concentrate (which is awesome, BTW) but you can also clean with plain water.I have some unusual cleaning challenges. We had a house fire so we are living in an apartment until the house is repaired. We are working in the sooty house daily and come home covered in soot. I also have a broken wrist that is in a cast. Despite the hair challenges, this machine does an amazing job of cleaning up after us and I can manage it easily one handed. Although the owner's manual isn't the best, you will get the hang of it after using it a little and it's truly excellent. I will update if I have issues in the future but so far, I am very pleased with how well this works.UPDATE: I am now in love with this machine and cannot imagine life without it. My oldest dog is 18 and failing fast. We take her out in a doggy stroller because it is too far for her to walk and the other day, she had a pee accident in the hallway and elevator before I saw it. Tineco Floor One S3 to the rescue. I was able to clean the hallway and elevator floor quickly and easily. Have just ordered more cleaning solution because a) it's really good stuff and b) it will void your warranty if you use another brand.2nd UPDATE: I am still in love with this machine. My floors have never looked better and it's so quick and easy to clean up a sudden mess. Once you get used to cleaning the dirty water tank and refilling the clean water/cleaning solution tank a couple of times if you are cleaning ALL of your floors, it still saves you so much time and is much easier than even a swiffer and the floors are left very, very clean. Do learn from my mistake, though. Don't leave dirty water in the dirty water tank overnight - rinse it out right away after you are done cleaning. If you leave it overnight (or longer), the plastic tank will pick up a gross smell. If that happens, you need to clean it out and then let it sit with a bleach and water solution inside the tank for a day and then, maybe even let it sit out in the sun for a couple of hours to get rid of the smell. This won't happen if you clean out the tank right after you finish using it or after a self-cleaning cycle has been run. The machine will tell you to do this so listen to it.",One

But the dirty water thingy doesn't give me the ""dirty"" message as often as the crosswave did.

I have a Bissell Crosswave corded and wanted a cordless mop vac. I was going to get the newer Bissell Crosswave cordless and after a lot of research and a good Prime Day sale, I bought the Tineco. I‚Äôve used it only a couple times so far and have no buyers remorse.So comparisons. My corded Bissell Crosswave is extremely loud, I mean twice as loud as a standard vacuum. Yes, the cordless Bissell is much quieter, but I feel you can barely here this Tineco.My Bissell would squirt unevenly and often leave streaks. So far, the Tineco is a nice even coverage with no streaking.Weight difference - hands down the Tineco is lighter. I mean significantly lighter. Surprisingly it being battery operated you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be heavier, not the case here. For elderly or weaker individuals, I‚Äôd definitely go with the Tineco.Cleaning the machines are both similar.I do like how the Tineco one operates better than the Bissell Crosswave. The Bissell operates like a steam cleaner. You have to push the spray button and release when you just want it to suck. The Tineco does it all on its own. Also I like when you sit it up to stop, it auto shuts off. Then starts automatically when you go to vacuum again.",One

Before the Tineco machine, I struggled every day trying to get the tile looking clean. i used different mops and even a steam cleaner, but the dark tile looked dusty and hazy all the time. I swept or vacuumed first, but it did not help. Now, I just run the Tineco machine over the tile once and the dark brown color is shining, with no dust or haze. I don't even sweep up birdseed and dog hair before running the machine! With just one pass, the floor is perfect! The water i pour out of the machine at the end looks like mud! Very satisfying. The floor dries very quickly after, almost no waiting to walk on it. Plus, the machine is self-propelled, so I am using much less effort. Cleaning the floor is easy and gratifying now. At first, I had a problem with the battery running out before I finished all my floors (whole house is tiled), but then I read the instruction that said the battery will last longer if you run the machine on ""regular"" (one light bar), not ""max"" (two light bars) power. I tried this and was able to clean my whole house without recharging. I had extra power left after cleaning the whole house, so I could have used the ""max"" power part of the time, but I didn't need it.

RJV,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny,the United States,5-May-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"The Tineco Floor One S3 Smart Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner is by far, the best small appliance purchase I've made in years.As a frugal person, it was a difficult purchasing decision (making such a large investment) but it was definitely worth every penny. (I mean honestly, it's a lot of money for a mop.) Considering I used birthday gift cards to make my purchase, it helped offset my buyer's anxiety.But don't be deceived, this 'simple' mop is anything but: it's multi-talented and makes cleaning incredibly easy and dare I say...kinda fun.  First, let me talk advantages: The Tineco Floor One S3 is so convenient to use because of its sleek design. I can grab-and-go for quick cleanups or take my time with an all-over cleanup and not get an arm workout. Also, the sleek design makes it easy to lift, carry, and maneuver while cleaning so it really does require little effort on the user‚Äôs part. The fun aspect of using the Tineco S3 has actually encouraged participation from my family to help get the floors clean.The fact that this device vacuums AND mops at the same time is also incredible. It's nice that you don't have to do a heavy vacuuming before mopping. I researched other mops and I really wanted one that could vacuum and mop simultaneously and the Tineco S3 has figured it out. Also, with a rotating cleaning brush, I rarely need to run the device over a stubborn spot more than two times.A game-changer for me was the cordless feature. I honestly was skeptical that I would get any good cleaning results, but I am a true believer in the Tineco S3 after seeing that a cordless floor cleaner can keep up with the corded guys and the Tineco S3 has got the corded floor cleaners beat; I‚Äôm not wasting time unwrapping/rewrapping power cords just to clean up a small spill.On the downside: Some users may find the AI verbal commands a little annoying, however, they do sometimes come in handy when the user is doing something wrong; the Tineco voice will explain the necessary correction and get the user back on track. The AI also handles the self-cleaning mode with ease (along with user assistance) albeit with the robotic voice commands.Another downside is the Setup and User Manual. Don‚Äôt expect to have detailed instructions to clarify some of the features. (Honestly, who reads those nowadays?) Just about everybody wants a ‚ÄúQuick Start Guide‚Äù and then leave the detailed User Manual for troubleshooting. But be prepared to use your noggin‚Äô to figure out some of the setup and features, but once you figure it out, you‚Äôll be on your fun-loving, floor-cleaning way.",29

This iFloor 3 is a great model to have.  It gets the job done, saves me so much time, and makes me feel better about the cleanliness of my floors.  I was using one of those old familiar spray the floor, wipe with a pad style cleaners (I'm sure you know the one) and it was leaving streaks and just basically smearing all over the place if you tried to tackle anything major.  I have a kitty who's a litter tracker and often steps in piles of urine before making a dashed escape.  This machine has changed our daily routine so much!  No more on hands and knees with microfiber to make up for what the other wetjet type device did.  (oops I said part of the name)  My iFloor 3 has a great swivel handle that compares to my dyson vac which is great for turning corners.  I will say that it does not get as close to wall edges as I like but rarely do I need to get that close... most messes are splat right in walking paths.  I was looking for a device that had a separate clean versus dirty water tank, got it!  I was looking for something cordless that wouldn't run out while I was mid-cleaning, got it!  I was looking for something that could self-clean at the touch of a button, got it!  My only suggestion to the company would be to make it suction when pulling back not pushing forward as I would prefer to work my way out of a room instead of forward having to step over damp floors.

It moves it itself, of course with directional motivation from you, but you don't have to use muscle. You really shouldn't because I did and hit a chair and it sounded like it was dying a little. So becareful to not run it hard into furniture. You don't really have to use any muscle to push it. It's awesome that it is self cleaning. Also the deodorizer/cleaner it comes with, last for a while instead of being gone in one clean. You only need one tiny capful per water fill.

Calli Conger,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean House Essential!,the United States,26-Oct-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Coming from a momma of two and a clean house lover, I had to try this vacuum mop! I absolutely love the functionality of the product and the convenience. Truthfully, I haven‚Äôt picked the broom up, but maybe a handful of times since my purchase. It has made my everyday cleaning process so much more simple. This product is absolutely worth every penny. While we are all hoping for a miracle robot to follow us around and clean our messes at immaculate standards, let‚Äôs be real they don‚Äôt exist right now. This product is not going to deep clean, rejuvenate or steam clean your floors. However, the product does clean recent stains, dirt, hair and small object debris. I find it best to deep clean my floor once a week using my heavy duty steam mop, and my tineco for everyday use. Definitely would buy over and over again! I do wish the product had a light near the suction roller, larger tank capacities and the cleaning solution was much more accessible. But all in all, I love my tineco!",One

Delilah,3.0 out of 5 stars,1st time use,the United States,5-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This is my second one. The 1st one showed full battery but never turned on no matter what. This one works. After 1 use:Pros: Dry quick. Loved the fact that I didn't need to vacuum before (my main reason for getting it as I don't mind vacuum or mop but less time by cutting out one is good.) It didn't kick the dirt around. Vacuum edges decent. Had to go over areas a few times to clean certain spots that I know my Monado would've taken off immediately. It did do a good job at cleaning but takes a bit longer than mopping,  granted I double clean my floors.Cons:I only cleaned my kitchen and entry way that has marble tile (cheap ones) and I had to refill the clean canister 3 times and empty the dirty one 3 times and and it went in to self clean 3 times. Its about160 sq  feet max.  My floors were not that dirty. I still have to clean the machine, I did empty the dirty container and washed it out real well but not the brush roller yet.Even with refilling and emptying the canisters I feel it still saved some time. The canister cleaned out easier than a bucket and the floors dried easy. I will still need to do deep clean once a month or less.Is it worth the price. Mmm. Will c in the next month.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,I really tried to love this product,the United States,24-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"As the title suggest, I wanted to really like it. I tried to test it against a variety of conditions and standards in my household, but ultimately it fell short of my expectations.The idea behind this product is versatile and handy, but the execution just leaves more to be desired.Here are a few key points to consider about this product from my personal experience:1.  The product leaves streaks on laminate flooring which really detracts from that clean floor feeling.2. The product has a very short battery life so it works best in small spaces. For larger spaces, anticipate waiting on charge times.3. It doesn‚Äôt work well as a deep clean product because it cannot get the edges. You can have the best vacuum/mop tool, but if it can‚Äôt get everything‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point? So after a full cleaning with this product, I still have 10% of flooring that needs to be manually cleaned.4. This product is smart, but that can be a bit annoying. After each use, I would put it back on the charging block. The product would then run its self clean cycle and without fail, I must ‚Äúclean the dirty water tank and clear the debris channel.‚Äù Great idea, but sometimes you just want to clean and go. It‚Äôs meant to be a quick clean up after all. You need to listen to the instructions however because should you neglect to clean it after each use‚Ä¶ the tank will smell so horrid it will belong in the cesspool.5. The self clean ability is interesting and does a decent job of cleaning components. I have noticed however that it requires a deeper clean and I have not yet figured out how to do this. Without a deeper clean, I notice a weird smell coming from the product when in use.  My only solution so far has been to run the self clean cycle multiple times.6. You have to remember that although it can vacuum and mop, it utilizes the same tank. So you might not want to vacuum every little thing you see because you will quickly obstruct the debris channel and have to clean it out before continuing use.7. You can only use a specific cleaning solution.8. The solution tank and dirty water tank are not that big, but then again, you don‚Äôt use an absurd amount of solution.Overall, I think this product is best marketed to a single bachelor or maybe someone is a small apartment. This is definitely not a product for someone with kids and pets. Personally, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the money nor would I be quick to give up my vacuum, broom or mop after purchase. Handy tool though‚Ä¶ sometimes.",One
Morgan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy twin toddler momma,the United States,6-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I've been using a Shark steam mop for about 5 years, and it stopped hearing up so I needed to replace it. Having something to avoid scrubbing my floors is crucial to daily life because I have a back problem, and I have 2 years old twins. Our floors get very dirty very fast with our kids, and because my husband is deployed right now, I can't spend a ton of time cleaning the floor every day.Pros:1. You can choose the temperature of the water via your faucet... so it does not heat up the water, and that should make it safe to use on pretty much all flooring types.2. It does not use a lot of water, and so the floors dry very quickly.3. It only cleans the floor with clean water, unlike a standard mop. You can seriously feel the difference on the floors.4. It is relatively quiet, similar to a standard vacuum.5. The self cleaning function is really amazing, and the parts that do need to be washed are simple and quick to clean.Cons:1. If you don't pay attention to the lower compartment (dirty water), and it gets too full the dirty water will leak out.2. The battery is not replaceable, but it hasn't died on me while cleaning.3. It is motorized... and I'm not sure this is actually a con, but it will get away from you if you aren't holding it firmly.4. It doesn't get edges or corners.Overall, this has been a lifesaver for me, and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.",One
Jenny J,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, not life changing",the United States,3-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I have two toddlers and a non shedding dog. I use this only once a week but spot sweep and hand clean big spills in between. I'd say my floors see a lot of messes but are pretty clean and should be an easy job for this appliance. I still find myself running it on Max every time I use it because even with relatively clean floors I just don't feel like it does a great job on the regular setting. We have quite a bit of laminate wood flooring and I also need to change the tanks quite often and recharge two to three times to get all my floors. Obviously that's in part because of running the appliance on Max but I have to do what I have to do for it to be effective. On that max setting I would definitely say that it leaves my floors as clean as a sweep and manual mop. Even with the added hassle of charging and tank changing it is a lot less work overall. Sometimes I just don't have the time to recharge so I end up doing some of my floors the old fashioned way. I feel like this is an amazing idea that still needs some improvement.

I have to add more solution and waste about 3-4 times when cleaning the entire house. My house isn‚Äôt that big so it does get kind of annoying to have to stop to add more solution and empty the tank. I would recommend adding more solution/emptying the tank at the same time, otherwise you will have to keep stopping since the solution doesn‚Äôt always run out at the same time that the tank fills up (vise versa). It also doesn‚Äôt do well around the edges/corners. You can make it go all the way to the wall but it won‚Äôt clean the last inch so you can still see the dirt on there.",3

John Crisafi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for basic cleaning and cleanup of spills,the United States,10-Oct-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"With multiple kids, we were looking for something to make frequent after-meal cleanup easier. Crumbs, peas, pizza, etc are always falling from plates. We have a cordless vacuum and that helps, but isn't good for debris that isn't completely dry, like the peas and pizza. So we end up having to wipe up most of it with napkins before we can vacuum and we have to vacuum multiple times each day. Our entire first floor is bamboo and our bathroom is penny tile, so we need to keep the mess under control or the kids spread it quickly.We bought a Karcher FC25 from Costco because it was supposedly able to handle cleanup without having to pre-vacuum, but it just kicked everything around, so we still had to clean up manually and then use the Karcher to mop.My sister showed this Tineco to us when we visited her house, then I found it on sale a few weeks later and decided to try it. After a month of use almost daily, I really like it. It is must more convenient to use than the Karcher since there is no cord. Actual use is similar to the Karcher - the microfiber drum spins and picks up debris and the vac sucks it into the dirty tank. Comparing the two units, the Tineco doesn't kick stuff around at all and it handles spills better. Just today I grabbed it to clean up a yogurt spill. The Karcher seems to get the floors cleaner while leaving them drier.  With the Tineco, I have to go over the same spots over and over, or slowly, occasionally. The Karcher needed the same with certain messes, but not as often.Both devices have obnoxious clean water tanks with a small hole for the water that is not in a corner or edge so it is nearly impossible to get all the water out of them when finished.Both devices have pretty simple, 2 piece dirty water tanks, but the Karcher is is easier to rinse. The Tineco has a small, hard-plastic prefilter of sorts that either needs to be removed when rinsing or I have to pick the debris off.The stand for the Tineco is nicer since it has storage built it. Charging is easy since the vacuum rests in the stand and automatically starts charging. The battery is plenty for me to do our kitchen, eating area, hall, bathroom and more small spaces with battery remaining, maybe 700 ish square feet.Other thoughts:Handle is comfortable.Automatic roller rinsing is convenient and works well.Takes a while to charge but not slowly enough to be a problem.Edge cleaning is a disappointment. Since the roller is encased, the roller can't get as close to anything. For that reason, the Karcher makes it much easier to clean all the way to the baseboards and under the toekicks in the kitchen.I expected the suction to not be strong enough since some cordless dry vacuums have more power. However, it seems that the wet roller is very effective in picking up debris and the suction is plenty to clean the roller, so I am pleased.Overall, it was worth the money and I like using it. It is convenient, cleans rather well and is pretty easy to fill and clean.",

Terrence J. Gold,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeds my expectations,the United States,30-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Well, in short, this device exceeds my expectations. I was a little skeptical. Do I REALLY need this. On the off chance that it addresses my hardwood floor and 3 cat world would be worth it - so gave it shot. Read on for notes. NOT a paid or influenced review.Unboxing was easy. FYI charge fir 4.5 hours before operation so first thing you should do and come back to it.  I‚Äôm tech savvy but lots of compartments, buttons, indicators, traps, so best to read the manual before even trying to figure it out. That took all but 15 minutes, then makes sense. On first use seeing it in action all becomes crystal clear and pretty simple (again, after reading manual). FYI, the documentation is actually pretty good.Operation. Very well engineered. All the compartments are well designed, convenient, fit well. Easy to get on and off. Prepping for use takes all but a minute and prepping for storage (need to empty and clean some parts sounds like a hassle but really only takes a moment l, dead simple. Was actually surprised.Using it. Man. This baby really does it. Now I wasn‚Äôt going to get the smart model, and I‚Äôll note that you don‚Äôt need it. But it pretty much either guides you through use (voice telling you tank is full, need more clean water etc) or the mode has changed, battery, need to do cleaning cycle, etc. It's useful.Also it has auto max/mode where it will sense the dirt on the floor and adjust water and suction. I was skeptical of this working well. But, it works REALLY WELL. I knew where my blind spots from my mopping routine are and it picked those right out like a police lineup! It‚Äôs a visual led that‚Äôs bright and easy to see that constantly visualizes how clean or dirty the flor is whole moving it over it. You can go full power instead if you want by pressing the same button (that toggles between auto and low or max) but the power adjusts so well and effectively I didn't need to even on heavy areas. Surprised me how well it works.Now how well did it clean? Basically I can eat off the floor. Seriously. I have hardwoods and a spiral staircase going down and can see all the dirt by looking parallel into the floor plane. I can see EVERY speck. After using this, zero. And even got my caked dried out gifts that my cats leave around. I mean otherwise I have to go in with hot water and messy rags. Think about what this does, spins the roller and solvent are super high rpm for you. Some took 10-15 seconds of patiently doing its thing but that was rare only when encountering those spots (which would have taken me more time to deal with otherwise). Otherwise, the rest of the floor was pretty much a single pass forward and beck and move to next pass. FYI, it appears the most effective way to do this is to move it forward and slowly back (the back motion appears to really take alot of the dirt away and suck up the way for a really effective clean and dry). Everything was pretty much a single pass.Also can‚Äôt believe a couple of things that I didn‚Äôt expect or pick up from reviews:1. Because it suctions that water back in floors dry SUPER quick. Like by the time I am done with the next section previous is dry. Say about 2 minutes.2. Battery. I expected to not be able to do my entire floor (kitchen, living, two bathrooms and a master bedroom). Well, did it all and have 30% left over. They say 35 minutes on auto, I exceeded that and still had a good amount left over.3. I was hesitant about buying this because I thought dealing with water, tanks, dirt water, would be a hassle and frequent during operation. It‚Äôs not only simple but only had to refill and empty once the whole tome (so one refill and empty during and then a final empty as I prepped to put away.With manual mopping you pretty much just water down and spread around the grime. Yes, soak some up, but this system really just sucks it all up and not spread it at all. Makes sense for a much better clean. For me, manual mopping is a thing of the past now. I got an extended warranty so Im certain to be on this program for several years.A little bit of a business case. I was using Bona. I go through a gallon of their liquid every 4-6 weeks. I mop my house once a week (with 3 cats need to). Considering that i did my entire living space  (2,000 squft) with only 2 cap fulls of Tineco solvent (capfuls are tiny and get so many out of a bottle) I'll make my money back on this in about 15 months for the price I paid. You get a bottle of solvent with the unit (also extra Hepa filer and roller) so i'm factoring that i only need to buy one replacement of each in that timeframe. So, it also logically makes sense.Although, note, you can‚Äôt tip it more than 45 degrees. You can get under tables but not under beds etc so for that I‚Äôll keep the swifter handy but is such a minor trade off.",
Cynosure,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing wood floor wet vacuum,the United States,25-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Cleans really well- I used to use swiffer wet jet- it would take a lot of ‚Äúman‚Äù power to press down hard and get the floors clean . This is really easy and light weight.  It pulls so you can feel the power it has!The only down fall to me is the battery life- only last 20-25 minutes(but the website/manufacturers tell you that so I can‚Äôt really say I didn‚Äôt expect it) .It‚Äôs amazing how much dirt it gets that you didn‚Äôt know you had!!Love it so much!,3

I would describe it as superficial. We have vinyl planking and also aggregate concrete. It did a horrible job on the aggregate just made a liquidy mess and didn‚Äôt reach the small texture cracks in the vinyl however the water did come out dirtyish( by no means black or filthy). Also when i ran it in on my vinyl planking i would run it for 2 minutes and then the self cleaning indicator would start flashing i would have to run over and run it on a self cleaning then would have to refill the reservoir and then run it again for two minutes. The hassle was not worth the trouble.  If you have one consistent flooring like concrete, epoxy or linoleum it might be better.",3
Sarah N,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I had bought this sooner,the United States,17-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I have been super hesitant about spending the money on a vac-mop for months, finally decided to after days of rain and mud. I wish I had gotten one so much sooner! I have laminate flooring and it uses less water than I do with a regular mop, it dries in 1-2 minutes. The auction power is great for bringing the water back up and the maneuverability is great with the swivel feature. You can‚Äôt over fill the water tank or lean it too far back or it will leak, which is a totally reasonable thing to work with. As for deep cleaning, if you have something like dried ketchup on the floor, I advise to scrub that by hand if you have laminate or let it soak if you have a waterproof floor. The vacuum will not scrub up long dried on messes.I have two dogs and two kids with lots of in and outs, mud and messes. My boxer is a slobberer and like to drink then walk around the kitchen dropping everywhere. A quick run over with this and the floor is no longer slimy.",One
Mashehu,1.0 out of 5 stars,Never turned on despite full charge.  AVOID THIS!,the United States,14-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I bought this on Prime Day in June 2021 and never got around to opening it and charging it (there was construction in my house...) until two days ago.  Easy to unbox and assemble and put in charging port.  Within a few hours, it was at 100 percent.  Great!  The next morning I went to use it (followed all directions in instruction manual) and it wouldn't turn on.  It was dead despite having 100 percent charge.  I tried multiple times, reassembled the vacuum (external parts only), checked for blockages as per YouTube videos, etc.  I called Tineco's customer service and only got a recording that said to leave a voicemail and someone would get back to me.  Really?  I did call Amazon for technical support and they helped me walk through even more troubleshooting techniques and still dead.  Wouldn't turn on.  I tried multiple additional times to call Tineco and finally got through to a nice person who told me to return it as it couldn't be troubleshooted and was dead on arrival.  I am lucky that I am within the 30 day return window and will get my money back.  Yes, I got a lemon but it begs the question about quality control.  I rarely write bad reviews, but having read other bad reviews, I just want to warn people to try it immediately when they get it delivered.  I was so confident that it would be amazing based on all the positive reviews that I didn't feel any urgency to check its functionality.  So disappointed because I loved the concept and thought it would be a great cleaning tool.  Returning it and not asking for replacement.  A bad first impression is probably a sign of things to come...",

Lou Verrone,4.0 out of 5 stars,Finally-Clean Floors!!!,the United States,26-Sep-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I rarely write reviews, but great products deserve mention.  After using countless other products such as brooms, vacuums, swiffers, mops, shark steamers, etc. there is finally a swiss army knife for my hardwood floors.  I was skeptical at first, but this thing works and works very well for 90% of my needs.  I sweep, vacuum and steam my at least 3 times a week.  I usually sweep first, vacuum and then steam clean my floors twice to ensure I have cleaned up as much dirt as possible, yet I always felt like I am just spreading wet dirt around.  After doing this process, I used the Tineco and man, this thing sucked up some dirt and a lot of it.  I always suspected this, but the water was filthy and I couldn't believe how much grime this sucked out of my hardwoods.  I cleaned the machine and pad, then used it again a few hours later and it was the water was still pretty brown.  The third time did the trick and now my floors are looking brand new again.  For kicks, I spilled some coffee , dirt from my vacuum and coffee grinds on the floor and this worked as advertised.  The only thing it doesn't do well is scrub out tougher stains/pots like splash of coke that is dried up, but once you get those few things up with some elbow grease and some stronger cleaning solution, this thing does everything else.  In summary, I absolutely love this machine.  My cleaning time has been cut but more than 50% using only one device and I now know the dirt is being removed instead of being slopped around.  I no longer have that sticky feel under my feet and my floors look as good as new again.  Highly recommended!  I just hope it lasts for 2 years or more.  Only time will tell.",One
Dibskies!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall worth it with a few minor design flaws,the United States,26-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Pros: I love this thing. It' so nice to not have to vacuum before scrubbing my floors. Such a time saver overall. I love the self cleaning feature as well. & personally I think the battery lasts longer than what it says. The suction is definitely great & it definitely cleans better than any other hardwood cleaner I've used. My floors look so much better. I also love that it uses so little of the cleaning solution per tank. The talking feature is probably unnecessary but makes it feel fancy & nice that it tells you exactly what it needs.Cons: I wish both the clean & dirty water tanks were a little larger bc I feel like I'm constantly emptying/refilling them. & I also wish it connected to the charging station better. When I set it on the charging station, it picks up that it's on there immediately & says ""charging has commenced"" & then checks to see if it needs to run the self cleaning cycle.. If it runs the cycle, you're required to empty the dirty water tank again, only problem is that when you slightly bump it to remove or replace the dirty water tank, it starts the ""charging has commenced"" & checking to see if it needs to run the self cleaning cycle all over again which can just end up being an annoying never ending cycle. Also when it self cleans, if you have pets, it definitely still needs a solid wipe down around where the roller brush connects (still so much better than others I've had though)... The fur just really collects there. We have real wood floors so the divots between the planks seem to be deeper than laminate & light ring seems to get thrown off by those divots & will turn red when I run it across them & it seems like it struggles with dark grout in between tiles as well but I didn't buy it for the ring feature. The only other nit picky thing I can say is that I wish they included a harder brush roll instead of 2 soft ones for things like day old drop of spaghetti sauce that hit the floor & I didn't get to type of thing, sometimes it just doesn't scrub hard enough & I still have to get down & scrub with a hard sponge or use my hoover floormate that has harder bristles to clean up.Either way I definitely recommend it. I've talked 3 of my friends who have pets & muddy-boot boyfriend/husband's as well & I have no regrets. I don't have kids but I'm sure if I did it would be a life saver.",

I bought this from a recommendation but out of the box the water wasn't coming out and cleaning like it's supposed to. I have been emailing this company for 4 days trying to figure out what to do. It's ridiculous. They don't have a live chat their phone number just goes to a voice mail which cuts you off  after 10 seconds. For how expensive this product is there is no excuse.

Karrie O,5.0 out of 5 stars,Godsend!,the United States,2-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I have POTS... its an autonomic nervous system disorder. Cleaning is physically challenging to say the least. I chose this vacuum because it's lighter than its competitors, has an ergonomic handle and long battery life. Having to sweep/vacuum and then mop... I can't physically do both so this machine is a godsend! While I was still dead and in pain after using this, at least I was less dead than traditional methods, and my house was fully clean. I can't grip a broom or vacuum after a few minutes so the loop handle on this machine made it possible to push and pull it without having to grip it with my hands. The self cleaning is amazing. I used to have a wet vac and hair in the bush was impossible to remove. This clumps it all together. I have long hair, two dogs, a cat, and now a foster dog and there is a LOT of hair! I'm finally able to walk barefoot in my house. I tried to use over small rugs and it kind of works, but the brush isn't designed for carpet. It can leave hairballs on the rug. One thing I learned is to clean out the dirty water tank and let it dry. The hepa filter got moldy pretty quickly. I went through 3 tanks cleaning 4 rooms and a bathroom. It is so quick to empty and refill that I found no issue with that. When I first used it, it was not picking up anything and I thought that it couldn't get into the tile grout... then I took the cardboard off the roller and it worked just fine... Lol.",One
Dana E,5.0 out of 5 stars,An updated review for higher elevation/altitude,the United States,12-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"My daughter gifted this to me, and I am in awe!!!I have a lot of hardwood flooring that I would clean on my hand and knees....scrubbing by hand.  It took forever, and by the time I finished I was worn out.  Sore from kneeling and wringing out the rag etc.  I would clean twice a month. Using this was soooo much more efficient.  I was truly shocked at how dirty the water was with my first time using this.  I felt like my floors were pretty spotless. (We don‚Äôt wear shoes indoor etc). I could also not believe how much drier they were left....cleaner feeling and also cleaner looking.  It gets very close to the edge to clean as well.The self cleaning feature is a breeze to use.  I do leave the clean containers out to dry completely before I reassemble.I have talked this machine up so much that 5 people have ordered one, and I myself,  purchased a second one for our cabin.  I am hoping they will love their ifloor 3 as much as I do mine!I am now doing my floors weekly and just love the results.This is an update on my unit‚Ä¶.I still LOVE this so much.  I had purchased a second one for a summer home that is situated at an elevation of 10,000. We live at the elevation of 5280 and have no problem with using the unit here .  However, not the case at the higher elevation.  It would run for approximately 10 seconds, then would shut off and the DWT (dirty water tank) would be lit to empty it.  Of course there was nothing in it, as it had only run for 10 seconds‚Ä¶.press the start button and another 10 seconds etc. I tried everything I could think of‚Ä¶did I have the filter in correctly , was it fully charged etc.  I brought it back home to lower elevation and works perfectly.  Took it back up thinking that it may have been a fluke.  Same thing happens.  Bring it back home again and works well.  I then contact tineco‚Ä¶.they told me to do a reset by doing this:I took it off the charger, with no lights on top lit up (battery bar etc). They said to remove the DWT and press and hold the self cleaning button for a total of 20 seconds.  By golly!  It worked!  My floors are finally clean.I put it on the charging base overnight and tried it out the next day‚Ä¶.all is well. No problems!  So if you experience anything like this, give the above suggestions a try.  They have such wonderful and prompt customer service.  I‚Äôm still telling people how much I love this and they are buying them and love it too!FYI‚Ä¶.I brought up my second unit to see if it would behave the same way up there.  It did exactly the same thing‚Ä¶.ran for 10 seconds then shut off with DWT lit.  When I went to put it in the charging base to self clean the roller and spin it dry etc before bringing it back home, it would not do the self clean, shutting off every 10 seconds.  I had to do the reset first.",One
C. Brewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,It Works! A True Back Saver!!,the United States,11-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I'll admit to being very skeptical about this product. We have three dogs and all hardwood, tile, and laminate floors throughout the house so keeping the floors clean is a real chore, especially during Virginia's ""mud season"" which is roughly from October through April. After a lot of reading of reviews, watching video reviews, and comparing this to the Bissell products, I made the decision to try the Tineco Floor One S3. I'm sure glad I did!Pros:- Super easy to assemble.- Lightweight- VERY quiet!- It does exactly what it's supposed to do... clean the floors without leaving a mess and dry quickly - no streaks!- It cleans itself after you're done.- Dirty water tank is very easy to clean (please dump it into the toilet, not your sink!! It captures all of the dog hair and gook on your floors which will clog your drains)- It picks up thick dog hair with no problem and doesn't clog- It uses very little water but still does a great job cleaning!- Uses very little cleaning solution which saves you money- Battery lasts for quite a while (it says 35 minutes, but it cleans so fast, I've never had to use it all up yet)- Max mode scrubs well- It doesn't scratch your floors- SO MUCH EASIER THAN A MOP AND SO MUCH FASTER!Cons:- Tineco cleaning solution never seems to be in stock (I haven't had to reorder it yet, but I have been checking their website daily and it's often out of stock)- It doesn't quite get to the edges of your floors. You might need to do a little cleaning at the edges on your own but this is pretty simple all things considered.  Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this product. I'll check back in a few months and update this review if anything changes, but it is a lifesaver. If you have pets of any size and a lot of hard floors, you will thank yourself for purchasing this. While it is expensive, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend it!",
SS Arizona,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent vac mop. LOVE IT!,the United States,3-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This works great for everyday cleaning except it cannot get off stuck on messes. I use it on porcelain tile. It cleans great and leaves the floor almost dry. Self cleaning function works awesome. I do not think the sensors are very accurate though. It does not get down into grout, very close to edges or really scrub the floor hard. But I do not mind any of those negatives. It is an excellent vac mop. I love that I can just mop without vacuuming or sweeping before. I use it about every 2 days and it keeps the floor very clean. A little heavier than I expected. Feels about twice as heavy as a handheld cordless Dyson, but not hard to push at all. The self propelled function is awesome. It is easy to clean out. I would recommend washing it out after each use and leaving the brush roller part open to dry and air out to avoid any stink. It is a lot easier than a regular mop and bucket. I still use my OCedar on occasion but this works so well and is awesome!I can clean my entire tile areas of roughly 2500 sq feet on a single charge and refill water 1 time. It is a little bit of a hassle to empty the tank and the machine does talk A LOT. I do wish you could mute it because it does have lit icons if it needs water or to empty tank, etc.I use it to clean the floor regularly and to pick up spills and messes of all sorts. It is very expensive but it makes my life easier so I do not mind the price. I have been using it for 2 months now and love it!",

Hands down this is the best purchase I've ever made! Between my toddler that's constantly dripping juice or dropping food on the floor, my husband that refuses to take his shoes off at the door, and my postpartum hair loss, our floors are a disaster on the daily. This has made keeping them clean so much easier and faster and has saved my sanity! I cannot say enough good things about this vacuum.I've followed the directions exactly as stated, cleaning the filter and dirty water container, as well as running the self cleaning cycle every time I use this and it's working flawlessly. With eco I can do almost my entire house on one fill up of water and the cleaning solution, but on max I have to refill 2-3 times depending on the state of the floors. This is STILL easier than all the work I was doing before! I've gotten used to when max is necessary and just switch it back and forth as I go along and it works great.I was surprised with how well this vacuum does at picking things up. I've sucked up whole leaves, cat food, and big pine pellet cat litter with zero issues. Hair also makes it into the dirty water container and, miraculously, hasn't wrapped around the roller at all so far. I'll warn you now that you'll be both satisfied and disturbed by the yuck that you end up with in that dirty water catch! At least you know it's doing its job ;)Cannot suggest this enough!

You will have to clean about 2 inches to the baseboards all around the room.  It needs to have about 16% of the battery left to self clean.  I also recommend you empty the dirty water tank and ensure it has at least 1/2 a clean tank of solution before you self clean.  I always run the machines self clean twice.  No one wants a smelly roller.Other than that I highly recommend this to anyone worried about having excess water left on the floor.  It is easy to use, does a good job, cleans about 1800 sq feet with battery to spare, does NOT leave excessive water on the floor, it easy to clean and hopefully lasts years.",One

But it works so well with so little effort that I would gladly go back with a cord if this was an option.Another downside would be the corners, the roll has large borders so it doesn't work on the sides.I was worried as the review stated the liquid was always out of stock. At the end you only need one caps of the solution so the bottle that came with it will last enough times till I receive it. But there are no sanitizing solution so I used a spray bottle for the hardwood and another one for the marble. I will get used to it.Overall, I'm very satisfied.",One

My floors are all hard wood in a house built in the 50s with some gaps, also laminate flooring in the kitchen and bathroom.According to my app I use it about 3+ times a day. All I can say is I wish I had this sooner. It's so easy to use just turn on and go and it eats it all. My only con is that it's not amazing at edging and the app was not easy to link to nor is the app amazing but the vacuum is. It's easy to clean, I love self cleaning and it comes with the tools. It gets the dirt you didn't even know about and there is a huge difference in the floor. They are so much cleaner. I also love that it dries quickly because with hard wood that's a must. My 8 year old can use this it is so simple.

D Redding,5.0 out of 5 stars,Should give it 10 stars!,the United States,19-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,This wonderful product has made my life so much easier! I have two dogs (one is a very heavy shedder) and two cats so fighting the hair on the floor is always a problem. We have all vinyl plank flooring so sweeping and then going back over to mop or steam it took a lot of time. This cuts the time in half and does a great job on getting the hair up and leaving the floors clean. Just be ready to go when you turn it on because it‚Äôs self-propelled and eager to get to work.I think the only thing I would change is to have a larger clean water tank. Since it is self-propelled and there is no need to push it I think the extra weight wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and it would save time by not having to stop and fill it so often. But that‚Äôs a small complaint for all this machine does for me.The self cleaning feature is really great. Just put it on the docking pad and hit the self clean button. Cleaning the dirty water tank is easy and fast.The only problem I found is that it does leak dirty water back on the floor if you stop it and let it sit. For that reason I always wheel it directly to the docking pad when done so dirty water doesn‚Äôt get back on the floor. After that the self cleaning takes care of the problem.I researched the internet for similar products extensively before making my decision on this model and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I highly recommend this machine to anyone. My husband used it for the first time the other day and gave it an enthusiastic two thumbs up as well.,

Anne,3.0 out of 5 stars,Has some design flaws....meh,the United States,26-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I waited excitedly for my vacuum to arrive. When it did I noted how heavy it was especially with the water tank on full.Here‚Äôs some flaws that other reviewers don‚Äôt mention for whatever reason:-in order to spray the water onto the floor you have to push down the spray button. Ok this seems simple enough right? I mean most devices have a button. But on this unit it‚Äôs on the back of the handle. When you place your hand on the handle, where your palm lies is where the spray button is. It was SO awkward trying to spray and vacuum at the same time. I am actually surprised no one has mentioned this.-secondly, this is pointless for corners. I ordered this to get rid of having to mop but now I still have to mop corners after using this. Instead I just purchased another swifter wet jet because at least that gets corners and has been trusty enough to work for years.-thirdly, battery life. Doesn‚Äôt last that long. They mention this so it‚Äôs not a surprise. But if you have a big area then you cannot get it all in one go. You have to keep coming back to charge.All in all the suction seemed to be very strong. I imagine with time it will weaken which is common with these wet/dry mops. I just felt like if I‚Äôm going to spend $300 on something at the very least it should be designed properly and comfortable to use.",

However as your floors are maintained, you don‚Äôt have to do the self clean and empty the dirty water tank as much.  I think the first time I had to do stop and do the self clean like 4 or 5 times.  Now, I can get by with just emptying the dirty water tank once and save the self clean when I‚Äôm all done with the whole house.It does leave about an inch from the baseboards but I‚Äôm ok with that.  The cleaning after you‚Äôre done is quick and easy to do.  The roller you just have to take out and let air dry as the machine self cleans that.  Then just empty and rinse out the clean and dirty water tanks and wipe the bottom with a paper towel and you are done.I love this machine.  I don‚Äôt use the app as I don‚Äôt see a need to. Highly recommend this time saving machine!!!!  I can‚Äôt wait to mop my floors again. In fact I think I‚Äôll mop right now.",
Rebecca,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall Wonderful! Worth the price!,the United States,30-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Good: my hardwood floors throughout our home look better than ever! They never looked really clean. They are a darker color so dust shows a lot and we have hardwood in the kitchen, so there are many spills. The Tineco does a good job of cleaning the dried spills, grease splatters from the stove and anything else that spills. Might have to go over several time in tough, dried on spots, or hold in place. So much easier than scrubbing and cleans much better. The battery lasts at least 30-40 minutes. The unit is easy to clean. The liquid cleaner has a slight scent that disappears when dry. It works really well at cleaning and is economical. You use very little per tank refill. The S3 is quieter than my vacuum, but I can't use it if others are sleeping upstairs. It manuvers well. Huge improvement in the look and cleanliness of my floors. I keep it handy, charged, and filled and can use it easily for small areas or large.Two things not so good: it doesn't clean well around the edges in the front and along the left side of the unit. It won't pick up a thin line of crumbs that's sometimes in front of my stove. (I just follow up with a quick sponge in that spot to get what was missed) Second, it's profile is a little high. It doesn't go go very far under my dining and kitchen chairs or the china cabinet. I have to move all the chairs to clean.That said, it cleans my floors better than anything I've tried. The dirt is gone, not just pushed around. The floors are finally clean. They look beautiful and it's so easy to use. Overall, I love it!",
Maggie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for toddler and baby moms!,the United States,17-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I love love love this for cleaning our kitchen floors. It is perfect for the constant messes my 1 and 3 year olds make. It‚Äôs wonderful for the post meal messes and end of the day clean ups. Does not work well on dried stuck on messes. I would not recommend using this as a replacement for deep cleaning. I still need to scrub tile grout to effectively get it clean, but does work well for our wood and LVT flooring.The maintenance of the water tank is easy. However, if you do not stay on top of it the tank can get stinky. I would also proceed with caution when using in bathrooms. Our 3 year old son is potty training and frequently gets urine on the floor, the tank can take on a urine smell.Overall, recommend and wish I had this when I was feeding my babies in their high chairs.",One
ismile,1.0 out of 5 stars,I really regret buying. Wish I could return.,the United States,3-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Vacuum and wet spinner are not working well for any type of mess. The vacuum picks up a quarter size of dog hair. If I run the Roomba after, I can fill up 2 more bins of dog hair and crumbs in the same room. It also cannot get any messes from under the high chair up and since it has to dry for 24 hours after each use, it never lines up with when I need it again. It also is very loud constantly reminding me to clean something, refill something, charge, so I can only use it in between naps with a baby on one hip then bending down to scrub every foot because it can't actually get anything up. I don't understand how it how this got good reviews. I saved up for 6 months for this, and it is useless to me.",One
DogMom,3.0 out of 5 stars,Time saver but‚Ä¶ on the fence,the United States,29-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This product is a game changer. I am mixed on how much I actually like it vs how much I want to like it.Pro‚Äôs: vacuum and mop at the same time, which can be a time saver! It vacuums well and by the look of the dirty water, cleans well. No streaking on my floors and they feel clean!Cons: no scrubber so if something is stuck on the floor, you‚Äôll need to scrape it off first. I also can‚Äôt believe how frequent I‚Äôm getting the alert to do a self-cleaning. I know I have a puppy and a cat, but I do sweep and mop regularly. Sometimes I am not even finishing my kitchen floor before the light flashes. Maybe I got a bad one? Also don‚Äôt expect it to clean the grout between your tiles. And it leaves about a 1-2 inch gap near the walls that are impossible to get with this machine.Overall, it is great for a quick vacuum and mopping. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price that it sells for. It‚Äôs great for busy folks who are in ‚Äúsurvival mode‚Äù. Like me, working full-time and in nursing school. Or moms with little ones who want to enjoy their time with their babies and not spend all their time cleaning floors.With that said, Moms: your cleaning can wait, don‚Äôt stress over a messy house. Your babies will grow up fast and once they‚Äôre grown, you can‚Äôt get that time back. Snuggle them, play with them. You can clean when they‚Äôre older. <3",
Tammy Ratkiewicz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall a good time saving machine.,the United States,23-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Update on my #tineco for all who keep asking....  at first I didn‚Äôt like it was honestly thinking of returning it. Kept telling me it needed to self clean very quickly and then once u self clean it uses most of your water and fills your dirty tank up. So I was constantly stopping to clean re-fill and dump. Customer service is also very hard to get in touch with as well. Once I finally got a call back from cs they told me the self cleaning starts blinking during cleaning as a reminder to clean once you‚Äôre completely done with your floors if it needs to self clean during a cleaning it would shut down. So once I learned this I‚Äôve been cleaning with no issues. Battery last longer than expected (I was going to get the S3 because longer battery life but this one does fine) now I haven‚Äôt cleaned my floors at all this week because I‚Äôve had cabinets getting installed, counters being installed, plumper here hooking stuff up appliances being hooked up. So many people in and out. So today I cleaned because I couldn‚Äôt handle the dirt anymore and here are my results as embarrassing as this is.... it worked so well with the amount of dirtiness going on, paper, paint, etc all over my floors. It‚Äôs truly a time saving machine (this vacuum and mops at the same exact time) the only thing I‚Äôm not fond on is cleaning the roller after each use because if not it will begin to smell.",One
Sybil B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,So easy to use!  Saves time!,the United States,1-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Everyone has been raving about their Tineco or Bissell Crosswave.... so I HAD to get one.  I did my read watch, watched comparison videos, and read reviews.  Several of the videos showed the Tineco cleaning better than the Crosswave.  After using each they would wipe with a paper towel and the Crosswave left stuff behind, the Tineco did not, the paper towel was clean.  That was my decision maker.... and I am so happy with my purchase!The machine itself is so lightweight (lighter than my cordless Dyson) and it maneuvers easier too!  My 4 year old uses my Tineco with ease!I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, and 2 cats.  My kids don‚Äôt spill a ton of liquid or sauce (luckily). So I can‚Äôt really say how it does on those from experience (in the videos it cleaned those excellently).  For our family it is a huge time saver and does a better job than when we would sweep and mop.  Our cats‚Äô litter box is in the laundry room in which our kids clean daily.  Before the Tineco they would sweep (they are long hair cats so hair is everywhere plus litter is spread around) then mop with a standard wet mop pad.  Since they have started using the Tineco they can sweep and mop in one step.  Plus it‚Äôs A LOT cleaner!  We have found the room actually doesn‚Äôt need cleaned as often because it just does a better job.We have bamboo flooring.  It saves me a step to sweep and mop in one step.  Like I said, I have kids and pets.... I don‚Äôt have time to sweep and mop all the time.I love that it is easy to dump out and then self cleans!  As I mentioned my kids use it everyday.  They dump out the dirty water tank and do the self cleaning on their own.My only complaint (which isn‚Äôt really a bog deal) is that we have to fill the clean water tank a lot; that water doesn‚Äôt last long.  We use it a lot so it‚Äôs not a big deal but if I had to list one thing that isn‚Äôt perfect about it, it would be that.Overall, my Tineco is a life saver!",
HBTC#1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saves us so much time,the United States,28-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"My son and daughter-in-law have one of these and we tried it out on their floors. Most of these type of cleaners never live up to their statements but I was so impressed at how well and quickly it cleaned their floors, we had to buy one for ourselves. We have hardwoods and tile in most of our house and previously I hated having to dry mop the floors then use ‚Äúseveral‚Äù swiffers to clean the dirt. This machine has cut cleaning time at least in half, gets pet hair, dust, dirt, crumbs etc.. off the floors then stores the dirty mess in a removable container. It‚Äôs battery operated, doesn‚Äôt soak the floors (the solution drys quickly so it doesn‚Äôt ruin hardwoods), easy to clean dirty water and even cleans itself when it‚Äôs returned back onto the charger. It‚Äôs more expensive than other similar products but well worth its price. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs made in Japan not China and of high quality. I haven‚Äôt been paid to write this nor do I have any connection with this company but had to write this review so at least everyone knows how good this product really is.",

I sent mine back due to the battery not charging. (Read other reviews, happens alot!) They told me they replaced the battery and sent it back. They did NOT!  In fact they did not even OPEN the box!! It was sent back to me packaged exactly how I had packed it, with newspaper packed in tight. I contacted them and they said they would send me a replacement, instead of trying to fix the battery on mine. My ""replacement"" arrived today, and the battery will charge, but it shuts off after 5 seconds. They replaced 1 problem, for another. Calling customer service is a toss up. You may get someone or you might be on hold for 5 minutes until they hang up on you. I wanted so bad to leave a wonderful update on how well customer service is and how helpful they are, but that IS NOT THE CASE! They tell you what you want to hear and make promises they cannot and will not keep.. Save your money and save your sanity!April 2021This wet vac is awesome!! At first I had issues with it blinking the self clean button, but once I was able to break it down and clean the suction area I found the problem (I sucked up a break tie) My floors have never been cleaner.

I decided to give this vacuum a try because of all the hype. For OUR situation it is not ideal. The fan blows near the bottom so before you can suck up the hair it blows it around the room. The roller is a soft terry cloth material, it needs to be more abrasive to grab dog hair. Also, the dirty water tank got clogged within the first 10 mins of using it. Sorry, its just not made for pet owners.IF YOU HAVE KIDS and no dogs that shed---you are gonna love this. It performs amazing to clean the floor and suck up dirt or stuck on gunk. We do not have kids, only dogs so this isn't great for our situation but I would 100% recommend this for parents with young children.The machine overall is sleek and easy to use.

Takes like 4 hours to charge and the power mode lasts like 20 minutes before you have to charge. So, 20 min intervals of cleaning the floor all day. Probably going to return.

Tatum Campbell,4.0 out of 5 stars,100% HONEST REVIEW,the United States,16-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Okay so let me start by saying I have wanted a competitors version of this for several years and just never hit buy due to the price. So when Tineco came out with this ifloor 3 with more features and a cheaper price than the competition, I decided to go for it. If you're anything like me you've seen this machine talked about on apps and blogs everywhere with great reviews and while it is a handy machine, it's not perfect. I didn't vaccum or mop for 5 days before I tried this so I could get a real feel for how well it cleaned.The suction is really great. It picks up almost as much as a vaccum would. Larger things get pushed around but for the most part it has nice suction. It is also SO quiet. I'm not sure how they made it so powerful and so quiet at the same time but they did a nice job with that!The water tanks are SMALL, my house is not large and I had to refill/dump 3 times just to do my kitchen and dining area. Not a super big deal but a little annoying.Next, this is supposed to come with cleaning solution and mine did not. I have not yet contacted the company to see if they will send me some, but I will update with how they handle this once I get a response.The maneuverability is almost too great Lol. When I turned it on it took off and slammed into the wall. I was not expecting it to be so peppy and it does get away from me at times. I actually like this though because your arm doesn't get exhausted from pushing a heavy machine back and forth.Finally, the mopping portion. This is where the machine let me down some. If you want to clean comparable to running a Swiffer across the floor, than this is perfect. However, if your mother is coming home for the Holidays and you need your floor, ""MOM IS COMING"" clean, this just doesn't do it. Like I said, I didn't mop for 5 days to really see how this did. There was a bit of cheap foundation of my floor that my lovely 2 year old spilled after trying to paint his hair with it, that it didn't even touch. There was also some dry ketchup because again...toddlers... and it did not get that up either.So, if you do a deep cleaning once a week and just want to use this for maintenance, I think it is perfect. If you're wanting to throw away your vaccum and mop and replace them with this, you're going to be disappointed.In all, I am giving 4 stars. I do love it and plan to keep and use it but the mopping part is not quite all it was hyped up to be.",
Emily,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great when it works,the United States,24-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I loved this for the first few weeks! It mops fairly well, and hardly leaves any wetness behind. It took off some stubborn sticky spots (toddlers...) without me having to bend over to scrape at it myself. The vacuum function is nice as well, although it really doesn't function as a vacuum well...we have pets and definitely couldn't use this as our primary vacuum. It's still nice to have the feature to clean up the bits that get left. The self clean is awesome. You can really see how much dirt it cleans up.All that being said, it was giving us a motor error at one point and it said we had to call customer service. It was not sucking water back up, just leaving a big pool of water. They only operate during normal business hours which was difficult for us as we both work. One time I called no one answered. I did not have a chance to try calling again, but after leaving it unplugged for a while and trying it again (which we had done before but not for that long) it started working and has worked since. If that's just a weird fluke problem it's not a big deal, but given that we had only had it a couple weeks it really worried me and gives me hesitation about recommending it. I do really love it though.",

The machine also self cleans, but I make sure to clean it very well after cleanings.*My floors feel cleaner longer.  You know how your floors feel ""extra clean"" right after you mop them when you walk on them with your bare feet?  That is how my floor feels the entire time between cleanings.  And I'm talking a week or two between cleanings.*Floor literally dries in no time.*Solution provided is non-toxic and will last you for SEVERAL cleanings. One cap full equals a cleaning.Complaints:*The battery life could last longer. I am able to complete my entire house with one battery.  This includes our kitchen, hallway, bathrooms, and mudroom.  People with larger houses may not be able to complete a full cleaning on one battery.*There is a gap between the edge of the wall and where the machine cleans. Maybe about an inch.

We always have to vacuum and then wipe out using a mop to really clean up. That‚Äôs not fun if you have a large floor space. This machine vacuums and wipes in one go. It feels like it‚Äôs self propelled as the roller rolls forward. The floors are shiny after one round of use. Really impressed by the effectiveness of this machine.This model also comes with auto dust detection, which I find helpful too. Cause on floors, a lot of times you can‚Äôt really tell if there‚Äôs something on it. Although you seem to have a clean floor, you will know how much is cleaned up when the dirty water tank is full.The auto cleaning is a relief too. Having to rinse the mop everytime after cleaning wasn‚Äôt fun.The only downside is I do find it is a bit complex to get started on the machine. There are functions and notifications that you will have to go through the manual to figure out. It also takes 5 hours to charge, and the machine would only work for 20 minutes one time.

It won‚Äôt pick up a lot of stuff in the corners so I have to sweep first.I had to manage my expectations with this and accept that this is not so much a vacuum as it is just a really nice and easy to use mop.

The best part is, to be able to clean up a water spill, of which normally involve wasting a lot of paper tower; this mop simply sucks up all the water, in several iteration, if there is lots of water. But the floor dries up fast and clean, and all it takes is just a few trip to dump the water and an auto clean afterward.A good tool and time saver indeed. It is no wonder a few of my neighbors also have it.",
BC,2.0 out of 5 stars,Was amazing. Updated review.,the United States,20-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Update May 2021 : I‚Äôm knocking it down 2 stars because this thing hardly works anymore. I always clean it out and run a cleaning cycle between each use, and I never overfill water or let water sit on the pieces so I don‚Äôt know why I have so many issues. It‚Äôs constantly going through phases where it will let me run it for a few seconds then shuts off. It also alternates flashing some of the lights when unnecessary (which also leads to it not letting me run it). When it does work, it hardly cleans the floors. I have wood floors, no hard grooves, and my floors do not get as clean as they used to. When it does work for me, I only get use out of it for small messes a whole bucket and mop would be a waste to get out for. Bummer. Tempted to try the newest version but these things aren‚Äôt cheap..First off, this thing is awesome if you hate cleaning. Personally, I find sweeping and mopping the old fashioned way daunting. This cuts cleaning time in HALF. If not more. My whole main level is hard wood. The only issue I have is battery life. 20ish minutes of clean time, 4 hours of charging. Not ideal for someone with as much floor as I have. However, if I deep clean more often, this will be PERFECT for daily maintenance!  Seriously, battery life is the ONLY negative I have to say. Self cleaning is amazing! Easy to empty the dirty reservoir and easy to refill! Love that it‚Äôs cordless and that it shows battery life. Another huge plus, is that it lets you know when it needs to be emptied/filled/self cleaned! One of the best investments I have EVER made in my 11 years of adulthood!",
Sarabeth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Thorough first time using it review, not bias, and would recommend with kids/dogs!",the United States,5-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Good: It tells you when it's still dirty, shows red- even when you can't see it and the light turns to blue when it's clean! It does a great job cleaning, moves itself, and is light weight. It also has a strainer so the dog hair and yuck will seperate from the dirty water when dumping down the sink drain üëçBad: I ran it (100% charged) in the dining room and when I was almost done it was dead, I had to charge it again to finish. I'd rather it have a plug in option. It doesn't get into small crannies, I wish it had an attachment. It goe a small piece of dog food stuck into it and I didn't notice, so the roller stopped rolling and sucking up and water flooded my floor. If your tiles aren't exactly flat (whose laid tiles are?) It will miss spots. I also wish it had a larger tank for both cleaning water and dirty water- I had to refill about 4x on my dining room alone- granted I did do the max power that way it would get it really clean the first time using it. This may have contributed to the battery power not being so great as well.Ultimately I would recommend purchasing this, especially with kids & dogs! I feel like its reassuring that I'm getting my floors cleaned and I'm not having to scrub super hard to do so or carry buckets of water back and forth. I am (surprisingly) excited for that next little milk spill I usually freak out over because I think for instances like this it will be fantastic! I hated spending this much on a mop, but I do love how clean it got my floors! üòÅü§óThis was my first time using it, so I don't know about durability or longtivity of this.

Joel Steinhauser,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great!,the United States,3-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôve only used it once but so far I‚Äôm happy and impressed! Between sweeping and mopping, it was an hour long exhausting chore to clean floors. This cut it down to half an hour with a lot less effort on my part. I have a back injury so mopping wasn‚Äôt easy, this glides itself along and is much better on the lower back. Our floors get so dusty so I was tempted to give something like this a try. We have a pretty big house with hard floors and were able to get it all done right when the battery ran out. That included moving moving couches, chairs, rugs, etc.. We cleaned under everything and did four bathrooms and the amount of dust and dirt it picked up was a night and day difference than my broom and mop! And that was on eco mode, have not tried max yet. I read that the battery lasts longer with eco. I‚Äôve never had a swifter and bristle crosswave so I cannot compare brands but I‚Äôm very happy with this. It‚Äôs easy to use and clean after you read on how to do it the first time. And no water streaks! So happy about that! We got the $299 version.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a time saver,the United States,9-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I bought this after seeing a tiktok video.  First off, it's cordless which is so nice!  It continually talks to you as you are using it letting you know what needs done.  If it's out of water, it literally tells you!  If  you need to empty the dirty water, again it tells you.  Any button you push is met with a audible voice telling you what you just pressed.  Once you are finished and you place it back on the charging station it will tell you if you need to clean it.  So with a push of a button, the machine cleans itself.  You do have to clean out the dirty water reservoir and remove the roller to dry but all that is very simple.  It only has a roller, no scrub brushes, so it does not get grout clean. The suction is powerful enough to almost dry the floor.  And the charge lasted long enough for me to clean all my hard surface floors (about 1700 sq. ft.) without loosing power.  There is a digital indicator right on the top to let you know how much battery power is left.  I've only used it three times but so far no complaints.",One

Well, this little item is a life changer (or, at least, floor cleaning changer)!  No more slopping water to mop, no bucket, beats my spray mop!!- The amount of vacuum suction AND the mop cleaning ability are super.- Emptying the dirty water after mopping is a cinch.  (Please DO take care of it.  You wouldn't leave a bucket of dirty water sitting around, waiting to get smelly.)- The unit has a self-clean button.  It is recommended you do this after each use.  It's helpful to run it prior to emptying the dirty water.- At a not too distant point, (and maybe once a month, which is purely my guess) it will be a good idea to take the mop head off and do a thorough cleaning of the mop head area.  This is also very easy.End story - one more rave review to go with the prior thousands of happy purchasers.",

This Tineco iFLOOR3 Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner is not quite self-cleaning (how could it be?) but it is much easier to clean.  I was amazed at how much dirt Tineco iFLOOR3 cleaned up off of the kitchen floor, just a few days after it had been cleaned by the Bissell Crosswave.  The Tineco model is easier to maneuver than the Bissell.  It has a few eccentricities:  the self-clean light pops on when I'm about halfway through cleaning the floor; the clean water reservoir could be larger--it's easy to pop out, but a bit more difficult to set back in.  However, I'm pretty happy with my iFLOOR3.NOTE:  I've had my Tineco iFLOOR3 for seven months and have used it at least twice a month and for the first time today, I took the roller out to see if it needed to be cleaned.

I use it at least twice a week to clean my whole downstairs (around 800 sq ft). That space is split between hardwood and tile. I love this thing! As far as mopping goes, I have not been able to find better. We have 3 large dogs that are in and out of the house all day and this thing cleans up after them no problem. I do still vacuum before using this as it does not do well as a full on vacuum, not with the shedding our dogs do anyways. If I were to use it every day, it would be fine, but if I skip a day or two and there is a decent amount of dog hair, it is more work to try and use just this than it is to do a quick vacuum first. The roller will load with hair and you will have to do a ""self clean"" multiple times. If you don't have tumbleweeds of dog hair you need to suck up, this thing alone will do the job. I am able to clean my whole downstairs on one battery charge and I usually only have to stop to empty the dirty water canister and fill the clean water canister once during my clean. The dirt this thing picks up, I can't believe I used to push it around with a mop and think it was clean. I would definitely recommend!",
consciousmommy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great new vacuum,the United States,2-Sep-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,We have used the Bissell cross wave for a few years and loved it. Super timer saver. Used it daily. But it was time for a new one.We wanted a cordless wet dry vac and this one was a good price and seemed a good fit.The unboxing was worrisome. The liquid soap that comes with it spilled in the box so it took a bit of wiping down. Not the best way to start a new product.But the vacuum itself is nice. Love the cordless. It propels it self forwards which helps make vacuuming easier. Love the self clean feature. Just one button push. Self clean in Bissell was more of a chore than it needed it to be.I wish we could control the water coming out like the Bissell. Maybe I just need to get used to it but would be nice to stop water coming at times. Right now it just flows cactus Bissell that let water out when we pushed a little button.The clean water container seems small to me. Also the hole is not at very top so hard to get 100% water out. Over time I worry of junk building up there.The dirty water container is as expected. Kind of hard to explain but they have this little tray thing which helps to stop stuff reaching the air filter. In the Bissell we always clean the filter mesh since it didn‚Äôt have the little tray to prevent stuff from getting to it.It‚Äôs pretty light. Heavier than it looks though but not bad.So far so good. Just a few minor things here....oh and we love the cordless ability :),

But when I used this new wet dry cleaner I was amazed.  I expected the water that was pulled into the lower small tank to be dirty, but this was discusting.  I had been using the shark steam cleaner and thought my floors to be pretty clean.  I was so wrong.  Now I feel they are so much cleaner.  So this was worth the money and would buy again.  I have a few issues.  One: it is not light weight.  Moving it from one room to another is difficult for me.  I had to take it up and down stairs and I may have to get another machine in the future so I don't have to lug this up and down stairs.  The second issue is emptying and cleaning the tank with the dirty water.  I expected to be able to take the tank off (this was easy) but I had to take the tank and parts out and dump the dirty water.  Then clean the parts.  This is messy process.  I was hoping for an easier clean.  The battery lasted long enough to clean much of my house.  It will depend on if you use the eco option.  It will not last as long on the higher cleaning option.  So, this was not a problem. The cleaner that comes with this, should last a long time.  You add one capful to the clean water tank.  One of my bathrooms has a textured tile floor.  This device was not able to clean into the ridges of the tile.  I have not found anythiing that will clean this tile except on my knees with a stiff brush.",

A woman had all three models and used each to clean an area of a dirty floor. While the floor was still damp she wiped them with a paper towl. The paper towel came back clean after a pass with the  floor one S3. Typically I use a steam mop, but decided to give this a try because I was so impressed.Recently moved into a new home. Hired move in cleaners- the floors looked clean when we arrived. A few days later received the floor one s3 in the mail and I cleaned the floors. I was shocked at what this machine picked up. My husband did the paper towel test and it came back totally clean. Even he said he thought the floors were pretty clean before I used the s3, but there was a huge difference and we were both surprised by what I dumped out from the dirty tank.I give the vac 5 stars with some caveats. 1. Clean water tank/dirty water tank doesn't last long. I have hard floors in dining room, kitchen, living area, and bathrooms. I usually have to fill up twice, if I'm taking my time three times.  2.

Also, when running a cleaning cycle you don't always have to add the capful of cleaner. Plain water works well along with monthly deep cleaning on the mop itself. Keep in mind that the clean water and dirty water tanks are small so you will have to empty and refill if you have a large area to clean. If you use it on MAX the clean water and dirty water tank, fill up and empty a whole lot faster. Does this replace deep cleaning and scrubbing your floors? Of course not. Nothing can take the place of a plain mop, scrub brush and elbow grease. All in all this is an excellent machine for every day cleanups. I love it.",
JKay,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Mostly great, but could be better",the United States,10-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Pros:- Quick clean up of floor messes after my toddler eats or a spill- Self clean feature is nice (I wish Dysons had a self clean feature)- Definitely saves time and I can quickly get the floor of two- to three rooms done on one charge, depending on the size of the room- Before having this, I would have to vacuum and then steam mop, very time consuming. I still do this sometimes because I think the steam mop is better to be honest, but I can use this in between and still feel like my floors are pretty cleanCons:- Doesn't do a good job with dried on messes (my steam mop does a better job)- A lot of parts to think about and there is a learning curve in the beginning; you do have to make sure to take it apart and let the components dry or else you will have a smelly mess- Can't clean carpet- You have to buy the solution, which is not cheap (unless someone knows an alternative?)",
SD Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it. You'll never look back.,the United States,3-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I love this thing. I'm not one for gadgets or the latest greatest fad but I'm sold on this in a big way! I tell all my friends and family they need one. Was recommended to me by a friend and I'll forever be grateful! I can clean my whole main floor on one charge it does a much better job than I could with a regular mop. Saves me so much time! With 5 kids and frequent visitors there's no way I could keep to my own standards without this mop. I have engineered hardwood floors so I just use the hottest water from the faucet and no solution. The Tineco solution is not great for hardwood is what I've gathered with research plus I don't love the smell nor the way it makes my floor look.,One

The water dispensers are difficult to pop in.. Also be prepared to clean it thoroughly everyday if you use it often. Hair, and particles will accumulate on the roller and suction area, and turn into sludge with the moisture. This defeats the purpose of it being used to clean.

deligirl2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent cleaning power!!,the United States,29-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum/mop was extremely easy to put together. It has simple clear instructions for it's use. The charging base is well designed to keep your home tidy and clear of cords and accessories. From start to finish i cleaned 4 different floors in 25 minutes and had the perfect amount of cleaner and clean water in the tank. I was shocked at how dirty the water was when i was done. Taking the vacuum all apart to clean and rinse all the components was simple and seems it will be extremely easy to keep clean. this vacuum gives me assurance that my family will be walking on clean floors for good now. I will be scrubbing the floors much more often now! This vacuum is lightweight and easy to maneuver around corners.

J,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Floor Cleaner,the United States,30-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I'm very happy with this purchase. My floors are actually clean now. I didn't realize that when I was using a regular swiffer mop that I was mostly just pushing dirt around. Then I saw someone post a video of their Tineco on tiktok and I knew I had to have one. Its very easy to use and does a great job. I clean my kitchen floor, entry hall, main hall, and an 8x8 section of flooring by my back door, all on full max power and the battery never gets below 30%. My constructive criticisms are as follows:1) The dirty water tank and the clean water tank do not coincide as far as timing. For instance, my dirty water tank will need to be emptied and then about a minute or two later, my clean tank needs a refill. I've learned that when one needs my attention, it's best to just do both. I'd love for them to somehow make these match up.2) It would be great if they could somehow increase the capacity of both tanks.3) There is a small edge issue, meaning if you are trying to suck up a piece of dirt that is right at the part where the floor meets the wall, the size of the vacuum head does not allow you to get close enough to suck it up. This is where extra suction would make a huge difference.All in all, this is a great product and I feel so much better knowing that my floors are truly CLEAN!",One

I ran it through 'self-clean' THREE times and then the 'dirty water container' was no longer gray! It was more of a foggy/murky water. It also pushed out some extra hairs so I highly recommend you do some extra cycles to really get everything out.

Its a job. And, I have two large shedding dogs. We had a period of a ton of rain and so I really let my floor go where my dogs come in and out. It was a mess. One of my dogs also loves to bring leaves in the house so it was really bad. I wish I would have videoed the cleaning. I couldn't believe how this wonderful machine sucked up the dirt and cleaned the floor. SO impressive! It was like one of those commercials where you really don't believe it works that well.  Well, I can say it does. Life saver for me and worth every penny!  Cleaning it is no trouble either and the self cleaner is really cool to see how you think its clean, and then it runs and wow...",

April,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn‚Äôt be happier,the United States,20-Feb-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This is 100% worth every penny for a streamlined way to clean my laminate floors. For reference, we have 3 dogs, a cat, and a baby. I used to vacuum daily with my dyson stick, then mop with my O-Cedar spin mop about 2x/week. The main things that I didn‚Äôt like about that process was the time it took, the mediocre results, and the fact that I end up using dirty mop water to clean the floor. Now, I vacuum my rugs with my dyson first, then fold  over the edges of my rugs and clean my laminate floors with the Tineco. The only thing is that since we do have two dogs that shed, I have to go through somewhat of an extensive cleaning of the Tineco itself after each use, but I don‚Äôt mind it. I just make sure any built up hairballs are removed before and after running the self cleaning. The battery life is sufficient for my home, it easily runs long enough for about 800sqft that we have in hard flooring. I switch back and forth between auto and max depending on where I‚Äôm cleaning, this helps it run longer.",
Jessica Allen,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good.,the United States,22-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Product is pretty good. Big downside is that it doesn‚Äôt seem bulky until you realize that it can‚Äôt get anywhere near corners or within about an inch of walls. It does deep clean, showing me that my traditional mop just wasn‚Äôt cutting it.. but it doesn‚Äôt do well on dried on spots. So if you‚Äôre looking to mop only weekly with this, this might not be for you. This is best for instant spills and wet items. Anything dried I would have to let it sit on the spot on max for over a minute to make even a dent in it. I found it easier to spray the spot first, use a scrub daddy on it, then use this to clean up that mess. Overall pretty good product though. I threw out my mop. I still run my roomba though for the corners and 1 inch wall space this can‚Äôt get.",One

I knew my floors were dirty but DANG I didn't know just how dirty. The day it was delivered, I did my hardwoods 3x until the dirty water collector was only a semi-murky color instead of the gross mud brown it had been the first clean.Pros- Can see the filth that you're mopping up- lightweight, semi self-propelled- easy to set up & store- good battery life for the areas I need to clean- light, pleasant scent to the cleaning solution- works well on hardwoods & vinyl (would probably be great for tile too, we just don't have any in the house)- dries quickly without streaking- can also clean the kitchen fatigue mats (this is a BIG plus for me)Cons- doesn't get flush to the wall/baseboard; leaves a 1"" gap unmopped- have to Self Clean at least once during each cleaning session (maybe my floors are just that dirty IDK)- doesn't do well with stuck-on messes (great with dried dirty paw prints, not great with week old jelly/sauce)All in all, the iFLOOR3 is awesome. The edge gap irks me, but that's something I can live with. Would absolutely buy again.",

The price of this machines is high but no more mopping for me! It makes it easy to clean my floors and picks up the dog hairs which I appreciate. I also have laminate, tile, and carpet in my house and it performs pretty well on all of them.

Tavin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for paw prints and can't find solution,the United States,10-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"So let me start by saying I do love this mop. It's cordless function makes it so easy to move around the house and the dirty water tank is always brown so I know it's sucking up dirt. However, it doesn't do a good job for paw prints which is the main reason I got it. I have 2 huskies so I always have dirty pawprints in my house. The flaw here comes from not being able to control the amount of water that comes out. When the floors are covered in prints it looks like its not spitting out any water hardly. To fix this issue I have to use my bissel spin wave to break up the tough prints and then I go back with the tineco to pick up the residual dirt. I'm still having to vacuum twice for a job that I was hoping this would conquer no problem. It takes forever to charge and I have to clean and refill the tank at least 4 to 5 times to do my whole house (if I can get through it in 30 minutes).Sexond: you have to use the tineco cleaning solution or you void your warranty. I havent even picked this thing up in months because I ran out of solution and It's always out of stock. What good does it do me to have a mop I can't use.Overall it does a good job at picking up dirt but it doesn't make my life any easier.",

I did not test it when it came back as I was starting to have issues with my first machine and wanted to be sure to give them all the information so they can fix it.  I started a claim to have it repaired and thought I better take out the one that they ""fixed"" to make sure it worked good.  My mistake for not testing it as soon as I got it.  It is worse then when I sent it in.  They did NOT fix it.  So now I had 2 machines that did not work.  I called and emailed (first time their phones would not reach a live person)  They promised to replace both machines and as soon as I sent them that they would send me a replacement machine.  Well they are unreachable now.  It has been a week and 2 days since I sent the one machine back and they do not answer any of my emails and I just tried to call and they are not taking calls now.

I brought it to a friend for her kids bday party and she ended up buying one as well because she was so impressed with it. It pulls you when your mopping which makes it so easy on your back. The self cleaning feature is amazing unlike other vacuums I have had no hair has gotten stuck around the brush.

That is also a positive as you can visualize the amount of dirt on a floor.  Also, you may have to clean the tank a couple times during your vacuuming use.  I know mine gets clogged with lots of fine dog hair.I only have hardwood and the self propelled part of this vacuum makes it a breeze.

I have kept up on dusting and vacuuming the home so I was completely amazed at how much was picked up by this incredible machine! You can see proof of it in the video. YUCK. There was so much sludge at the bottom of the dirty water catcher. The self-cleaning mode is incredible (shown in the video). I took the vacuum through 4 self-cleaning cycles until the water came out clear.The vacuum self-propels. It's easy to use! Our cabin is 1800 sq ft and I got about 3/4 of it done before the cleaner ran out. The vacuum leaves very little water on the floor. I wore socks while ""mopping"" the floor and my socks were hardly wet at the end of the cycle.Amazing machine... time, back, and sanity saver! This is the best purchase ever (2nd to my Instant Pot)!",

Yes very high tech but the actual cleaning part not very good. I could‚Äôve bought a vacuum for half the price and it would‚Äôve still been a very good vacuum. The reason why I selected this vacuum was for the moping feature and it is horrible, the water tank only gives me to do half the living room meaning I would have to stop and fill it up 8 times by the time I am done with the house and would have to empty the dirty water tank the same amount of times.

My floors stay so much cleaner and it's fast and easy. Cleaning out the tank is a little gross but that's because of the dog hair, the liquid is super easy to dump and rinse. The self cleaning feature of the brush roller makes me never want to use my traditional vacuum again. Sure, it's not as good as a traditional mop or hands and knees scrubbing, but if you're busy and on the fence, this is the ticket!

However, my unit did not function properly out of the box. The problems I had were as follows:‚Ä¢ When using Auto mode, the ‚Äòdirty water tank is full‚Äô prompt would trigger when the tank was only about 25% full. When using Max power mode, this did not seem to be an issue.‚Ä¢ The ‚Äòclean water tank is empty‚Äô prompt would trigger when it still had about 25% water left.‚Ä¢ The self-clean cycle never successfully completed a full cycle.‚Ä¢ Occasionally, the device stopped and prompted me to restart it or call customer service.I had this product for a grand total of two days and did not even get the chance to remove the plastic screen protector. When it was working, it pulled a lot of dirt up off my vinyl plank flooring, which makes it even more disappointing that I have to return this unit.

The mopping is swell and the self cleaning is magical! I always feel like no matter how much I sweep, as soon as I bring out the mop, a slew of little particles and dust bunnies magically appear - but with this device, it doesn't matter as it just sucks them right up.My son opened the fridge with some force yesterday and a bottle of salad dressing fell out, the lid popped off, and half a bottle of vinaigrette was suddenly emptied across the kitchen floor. I grabbed my new handy dandy Tineco Floor One S3 and darned if it didn't work exactly like the videos showed it would - cleaning up every drop. A real mess became a minor inconvenience.Best part is the time it takes to charge, because it does take a while, but it works for me. Sometimes I get into cleaning mode and just work until I drop. With this device, I clean until it's drained and then I relax, because I have done enough! Great product.",

I love the fact that it can detect when the floor is a little dirtier and it kicks into higher speed without you even having to do anything. It is super easy to maneuver and it pretty much pulls itself forward. It is absolutely the best thing and I am so glad that I went ahead and purchased it even though I was nervous because the price is a little high for my pockets. If you‚Äôre hesitant about doing it I‚Äôm telling you it is the best I cleaned my entire house in minutes and it normally takes me hours. In the instructions it said that it has a 35 minute battery life but I‚Äôm telling y‚Äôall I clean my entire house and it wasn‚Äôt even halfway dead.

Yes, the LED screen and talking is cool but I feel like the vacuum and the materials feel cheap. I was also extremely upset that the battery will die in about 2 years and because I bought it on Amazon then they wont replace it. Also, the app is clunky and kept failing. I also didn't find the cleaning of the vacuum after each wet use very easy. I don't think it really saves me a lot of time when I factor in the factor in the cleaning and the fact that I still have to go back to some areas because it doesnt have a hose.  Therefore this cant replace my other vacuum. For the price that it is it really just isn't worth it for me.",

I have 2 dogs and 2 ferrets the cleaning is too much I have dog toys all over the fur is not stop and my male dog has "" accidents "" he sprays we do out diapers on and walk him but sometimes he gets out of it. The ferrets are trained bit they have a mind of there own, so I find myself cleaning the corners every day .  So between the accidents and me taking a rag and some cleaner it just wasn't enough and the floors felt gross u could feel it vacuum every day and I still feel gross . I need to get a wet clean without having a mop and a vacuum so this is prefect for the hardwood floors and the bathroom title . You can see a difference right away and the next day it's still feels and looks clean. It gives the floor a shlne . Cleaning is easy and I can get it all done in 15mins my room the bathroom and living and kitchen. The battery is good I don't have to recharge in-between and the water lasts the whole time I don't have to refill . Omg I almost forgot it has wheels so u can wheel it around and it has a push so when u vacuum u literally don't have to do any pushing work just a pull back strength.",
Inna G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. Not a miracle worker but does the job well,the United States,28-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I bought this after seeing great reviews on tik Tok. The first one I received was broken. Although I wasn't even sure if I just wasn't using it correctly since there were no instructional videos on YouTube or anywhere else. I contacted the customer service they were very apologetic and offered to refund me or to send a new one. I received my new one and it worked amazing I have a small house and three kids and it's perfect for everyday cleaning. It doesn't get out things that are stuck to the floor obviously so I just make it lose with my nails or whatever I have and it picks it all up it's really great. I do think it's the price is worth it even though I hate cleaning it but I don't have to slave over a mop or be on all fours so I absolutely adore this product. I do think the price is very high for this vacuum. I have no doubt that in 5 years they're going to come out with something much more amazing and the price for this vacuum is going to go down.,

I opted for the Shark VacMop for $75 instead. I found the pads for the shark were $1 each and needed at least 5 to do the whole down stairs. Don't even get me started on the pricey solution. Every time I mopped I was disappointed.I finally pulled the trigger on this Tineco after reading a lot of reviews. The first charge took awhile. I should have plugged it in yesterday and started cleaning today, but I didn't so I ended up recharging a few times today. But to be fair, I cleaned all the downstairs floors (kitchen, dining room, massage room, both living rooms and bathroom) and upstairs (our bedroom, bathroom and laundry/craft room) and the garage landing! That's a lot of floor.Coordless- the docking station is super nice. Nothing to plug in, just clip the mop in and click the self clean button. Awesome.Self propelled- does a really nice job and saves my back!Solution- only uses 1 capful per tank. Cleans well. Doesn't leave residue.Tanks- only major complaint here- small tanks! The clean  and dirty tanks are small and need refilled/emptied often. But.... considering the alternative to pushing dirty water around, absolutely worth it.",One

Or so I thought. After one pass over my floors with this machine I couldn‚Äôt believe how dirty the return water was. My house is old so there is a lot of ground in dirt and little lacquer on the floor but if there was I might worry about it scrubbing too hard on the finished wood. (I‚Äôm not sure it can hurt my wood any more than 40 years already has.) As for the suction, it left so little water on the floor that one side of the floor was dry by the time I was finished with the room. It‚Äôs not heavy so it‚Äôs easy to take up and down stairs too. The only down side is there is no disconnect hose or attachments for stairs but for what it does do I can live without that. One of the best products I have bought in my life thus far.",
david,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, but we will have to see how long it lasts.",the United States,14-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"It works pretty good on mildly dirty floors and you just keep going over the same spot till the sensor indicates the area is clean. If you have dogs or cats and there is allot of hair on the floor, the mop will tell you it needs to be cleaned and you will need to clean out the hair every 5 minutes. I suggest sweeping a hairy floor first, and then use the Tineco s3 to mop/vacuum. If you clean your floors often you will not have to sweep. It takes 5 minutes to clean my kitchen, and only 12 minutes for my largest room. I did all of a 1400 square foot vinyl floor and ran the cleaning cycle on one battery. I was able to pick up a big pile of dog barf in two passes. For really dirty floors set the suction to max instead of using the default sensor and you will be happy.  You will have to add water and cleaner to the water tank two or three times for the whole house. The dirty water tank is large and wont have to be changed till you are done. You will want to empty and rinse the dirty water tank or your kitchen will smell like a janitors mop bucket. I suggest taking the mop roller out and putting in the holder on the base unit so it dries and does not stink; it comes off very easy. Update: This come with 2 mop rollers and I suggest using both mop rollers to avoid any stinky smells. After use take out mop roller (very easy takes 5 seconds-really) put it in the base unit which holds it vertically so it dries quickly and doesn't get smelly and put you spare dry roller back on the Tineco. Alternatively when you have only one roller take plastic cover off roller after use and self cleaning cycle so it can dry properly.",

I have hardwood all throughout my house and it makes cleaning my floors a breeze. I have a lot of animals and with that pet hair. There was not much talk with this product on how it picks up pet hair, but I would say that this product is NOT good for picking up fur balls due to the mopping aspect of this product, so I reccomend cleaning up any pet hair before using. Other than that it is a wonderful product. The only other downside is that she talks way too much and always repeats to do the self-cleaning cycle, even if you already ran it! I would also say that this product is not great at deep cleaning hardwood floors. It good for wet substances that was spilled on the floor, but not for wet substances that had already dried prior to cleaning.

Then water started coming out of everywhere. I also don't know where the soap is coming from since the provided Tineco solution doesn't seem soapy (makes me think I could've gotten a used machine?). During use, the Tineco asks me to stop and clean it so I do....multiple times. Only to return to the machine on the docking station with water EVERYWHERE underneath it. I've cleaned and changed the brushes and the tanks. I've reached out to Tineco customer service for help. With all of these great reviews, maybe I got a dud?",One
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to be junk,the United States,5-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This product can be absolute junk when it wants to be but can also be great too.

Trying to get ahold of Tineco is terrible, they don‚Äôt respond for days over email and by telephone you cannot get ahold of them because the influx of phone calls. Probably for this same problem I am having. I have company coming and my floor mop is spewing water all over my floor and won‚Äôt suck anything up. I‚Äôll stick it back on to charge and when it reaches 100% charge it will just magically fix itself and decide to work again. Going back to my good old handy dandy mr. clean spin mop from the dollar general which was 20$ That‚Äôs better than spending 400$ + warranty on this thing. Just one HONEST review.",2

lucas,1.0 out of 5 stars,clean sensor is just a gimmick and customer service is terrible,the United States,10-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"There is no reason to buy this. The sensors have a known problem and the company does nothing about it. They sent me a label and that was it. The stated after I ship it they will complete the fix in 1-2 weeks and then ship it back. the whole process would take a month.All of this was after I had been emailing them about the faulty unit for over a month. They would request my personal information and the product SN over and over, after I provided. If I did not send it each time they requested, they would not answer my email.the product is decent except for the sensing technology. My suggestion would be to buy the cheaper model or get the much more reliable bissell crosswave vac-mop which is far more reliable, cheaper, and with great customer service.This company makes little effort after purchase, despite having some of the most expensive products on the market.

It has been such a time saver for me. I have a lot of medical issues so it being so light weight and easy to maintain it a huge plus for me. The only issue I have found at all that truly doesn‚Äôt bother me a bit is sometimes around the rollers at the ends where they snap in our long hair will get slightly caught but I can pull that right off no problem. The battery life is great too. I clean my entire house and still have 64% battery left.I was nervous about spending the money on this product but I am so glad I didüòä.",

What woman hasn't dreamt of discarding her Cinderella..ella...ella broom, mop and bucket? However, I do not feel that this machine's results would be step-mother approved.  It's not meant for deep cleaning, thats one thing for sure.  Will it get light dirt and messes off your floor? Yep.  But still expect to grab the tried and true old mop and bucket for bigger, caked on messes.  Also, I have 3 pugs, and this thing cannot handle the amount of hair my pugs shed in one week.

Zoey Meeker,4.0 out of 5 stars,I seriously love it.,the United States,29-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Fist of all this is not a deep clean device. This is purely for convenience. That being said I love it. I‚Äôm ta simple and easy to use. It literally tells you what to do. Just make sure you keep it clean and you‚Äôre good. It does make the floors look fantastic afterwards however it doesn‚Äôt get up to edges hardly at all and leaves about an inch gap. For maintaining floors between deep cleans or for people with floors that stay pretty clean. I still use a regular vacuum and mop about once a week maybe every week and a half but I‚Äôm a neat freak and have three inside pets. Plus I spill quite a bit. For most people this would probably do it all.,

I am previously a sweep the whole house and then use bissell steam mop.Pros: ease of useExcellent suction power, very surprising!!Self clean featureCleaning brush has the flip out hook/blade in the end to get hairs off the brush roll if they have wrapped aroundOnly takes small amount of cleaning solutionBattery charge lasts a long timeFloors dry quickly!! Doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of water, even when you turn off there are NO puddlesCons:Misses about an inch in front of and to the sides when you use against the base boardsDoesn‚Äôt clean hardened sticky messes like a hot steam mop will so I think for a super deep clean the steam mop would be needed. But if maintained clean floors with tineco frequently then wouldn‚Äôt need a deep clean from the steam mop!For maintenance at the end of each day I spray a  50/50 bleach and water solution in the dirty water tank and on the brush roll and rinse out.

Evelyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,This vacuum is multifunctional and saves me time.,the United States,5-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum cleaner was very easy to assemble and it doesn't take up too much space. It doesn't need to be plugged in for it to work and that is very useful for cleaning around the house quickly. The vacuum automatically goes forward when you put the handle down a little bit which is good if you do not want to push it. The vacuum cleaner is very easy to clean and it says what is happening like if we need to clean the vacuum it will say it is dirty. The vacuum's battery life lasts a while so I can clean the whole house and still have plenty of battery percentage left. I have a golden retriever and he sheds alot and this vacuum cleaner can quickly clean up his hair. After I‚Äôm done washing dishes, I can use the vacuum to clean up the floor.

Everything about it is easy. I cleaned my floors and the first time the water was dirt black. It was shocking because I mopped 5x a week with 2 kids/2 dogs who shed a lot. I have used it numerous times and now the water is a light brown. That shows that it's doing it's job better than any mop I used. I used to vaccuum or sweep and then mop. Took about 30 mins to do both. This machine cuts that down in half and my floors are always clean. I had seen some some reviews about it streaking the floor and I figured out this happened when you put more than the recommended cleaning liquid. If you use the capful they recommend there is no streaking. Would highly recommend!",
Kaxie M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great timesaver to clean hardwood floors,the United States,14-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This product is easy to use and talks you through the steps of cleaning/care of the item. There are different ‚Äúwells‚Äù, one for clean water+solution and one for the dirty water. They are not very big, but easily hold enough water/solution to clean a large room without stopping. We love that there is no sweeping/dust pan step or wringing out the mop, or spaying solution on the floor to mop over. It‚Äôs all in one machine, in one step. The floor dries quickly and auto-detects need for deep cleaning (more water+solution and increased power to spin the brush) with ease. Your eyes cannot always see the need to deep clean and we love how it detects this need automatically. We have two dogs and have been using our Tineco daily for spot pet clean-up, and whole floor every couple of days. It‚Äôs so easy to use and glides with little effort across the hardwood floors, you don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a chore!",

I have a toddler whose favorite pastime is flinging food, a large breed dog, two cats, and people are constantly coming in and out of the house. In New England, we track in a lot of mud, sand, and salt. The tineco can handle all of it! I got this based on the vacuum wars review on YouTube, and now even my husband (who was originally opposed to this purchase) says we can't live without it.

Lisa C,5.0 out of 5 stars,So easy to use!,the United States,19-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Absolutely love my tineco! I love being able to vacuum and mop at the same time and my floors have never looked cleaner. I was able to show my 13 and 15 year old how to use it and even they comment on how quick and easy it is to use. We have lvp in our entire downstairs that is about 1200 SQ ft and we are able to clean the entire downstairs on one charge. My only complaint is that it only takes the tineco cleaning solution and it seems hard to find in stock right now. The tineco did come with a bottle of the solution though and it only takes a small capful so I think the bottle will last for a while. It also doesn't require for you to use the solution every time and you can use just water if you want.,

I let my Roomba run daily but it barely touched the hair from those 3.  The Tineco gets every bit of it up and cleans the floors perfectly in one pass. I can clean 1300 square feet of LVP floors thoroughly with less than a full tank. Then, I just place it on the charging station, run it through a cleaning cycle and empty the dirty water tank. Easy enough. I‚Äôm not sure why some of the other reviewers are having to change the water so often. It‚Äôs really a very simple process and worth the price!",
ESJ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not worth the money, charging time too long",the United States,24-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was between a 2-3 stars based on the price.  It works better than a Swiffer, sometimes better/sometimes not as good as a standard mop.The fast drying is a plus, but the amount of cleanup for the machine itself is too time consuming.  I had to dump the waste tank and refill the clean tank about 4 times when cleaning our small amount of square footage downstairs, and run a self cleaning twice in that time.  I was able to get our smaller downstairs space cleaned and a small amount of our kitchen on one charge, now I've been waiting a few hours for it to charge back up so I can hopefully clean my kitchen, dining room, and living room without needing to charge again. . . .With the price of the device it should either hold a longer charge, or recharge at a faster rate.  I noticed that it also does not scrub up deeper soiled spaces on the hard floors (when a basic mop could take care of it with a little extra scrubbing).

Melissa  F,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good, but not fabulous",the United States,19-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I had hoped this would be a game changer, since my entire first floor is either hardwood or tile. But, on the kitchen floor if there is anything more than a spot it won't get it up. And let's be honest, in your kitchen there is often food that falls to the floor and gets stuck there! It also feels like a lot of trouble to completely dismantle and clean after every use, plus the self-clean light comes on after just a few minutes of use every time. I vacuum my entire floor at least 2-3 times a week, so it can't be that dirty. I think it's probably pretty good on the hardwoods. It definitely takes less physical effort than mopping, but I still find I need to mop my kitchen to truly get it clean.",
Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight and high efficiency,the United States,7-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"My 7 year old Bissell Powerbrush vacuum started to leak, so I decided to give this highly recommended & kinda expensive brand a try. Fortunately I'm lucky and got a hit. It's worth the price.This Tineco wet dry vacuum is lighter weight, and way lighter than my old Bissell wet vacuum. It's much more easy to manipulate than my old Bissell.It works efficiently, cleans well on hard wood floor and tiles surfaces, no complaints.In this Tineco, the dirty water tank is vertically installed at the bottom of the handle, it is a better design than my old Bissell that has a dirty water tank on the bottom of the vacuum body, which is why the Bissell has to be always very carefully used horizontally otherwise the dirty water all spills out and causes mess, versus this new vacuum totally avoids this problem. I love this convenient feature a lot.This wet dry Tineco vacuum is cordless, my old Bissell has a long cord, not a deal breaker, but I'll definitely prefer cordless to a long cord. The battery lasts long enough to finish a medium size three br house.Overall I'd say it's worth the money, and of course it would be nice if it's more affordable.",

Self clean is a great feature.Suggest you purchase an extra roller - permits wet one to dry while spare is installed.UpdateMuch as how convenient it is to vacuum and wash, I find it easier to use my vacuum before washing with Tineco.Reason ... cleaning the machine, rollers, channel, & tank, of hair and debris takes much less time and effort.",

While it's mopping it also picks up all the dog hair I have around the house with it's awesome suction power.It will also clean itself but I usually go back and cleaneverything myself just so I know that the dog hairs hasn't clogged anything.The only negative thing I would say about it is that when I turn it off and does leave some water sitting in the floor, I'm sure it's a user problem but I'm not sure. I usually just get it up with a paper towel after.You can use really any cleaning products in the Tineco although the directions say otherwise (I'm sure that's a selling tactice)",

I want it to dry out each time so it doesn‚Äôt get gross in any way. But the real ick is when you pull the dirty tank off, all the longer hair (from the girls) and other debris needs to be pulled out from the roller thats coming up into the tank. I also have to pull the hair out from inside the dirty tank bc it gets twisted around. Not my favorite part. After draining and slightly washing out the dirty tank, it takes up a lot of time.",

RovingHogan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best daily cleaner ever,the United States,22-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,This is the best hardwood cleaner that I've ever owned. The cleaner is easy to use and easy to keep clean. The cleaner has a self-cleaning mode which makes it easy to keep the rollers and intake clean.  The batteries last about 30 minutes which just a enough time to clean the floors if you use it daily or every other day.  If you use it less often more dirt builds up which means that you will cover less area. So far I've used just the recommended cleaner and it seems to work very well. I use it just on hardwood and tile floors. I have not used it on regular carpet but I have used on a low nap carpet. It's easy to remove the roller and just let it dry.,

There are a couple times don‚Äôt get me wrong that if there is a lot of hair together I have to go over the area twice, but the second time it gets picked up. I can do my entire house before it tells me to self clean or to refill the water tank.

I called customer service, and that said I was still under the 2 year warranty. Great! II went through the diagnostics over the phone, was not able to fix. I am told they will send me a new one and that I can send the old one back in the same box. So they send an email and ask for a video of it failing. I film the video and send it to them. Then I get an email back saying to try a few more things. I try those things and they don't work.Then they say they will send me a shipping label, and they never did.  I also do not have a box, so I ask for a box, and they send me a cube box that is too small for the length of the unit. Now I am stuck waiting again for both the box and shipping label.It would be nice if they would simply send the new unit and allow me to use that box to send the old unit back just like I was told.

Dania Marthens,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,the United States,13-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"The not so good...If you have a large space to clean, you will not be able to finish within one charge especially since you need to stop and run a cleaning cycle often. This is fine, but it takes long to recharge. The dirt and clean containers are too small and fill up/empty quickly. I wish these were larger. It would have been nice to have the option to plug in rather than just wait for a recharge. Even if you purchased the more expensive machine with the additional 10 minute charge time (I ordered the middle priced one), it still would not provide you enough time to finish cleaning if you had a large space. Also, it does not get into corners or tight spaces.The good....The floors you are able to get to do in fact get clean. The components are very easy to dismantle and clean. The solution they provide works well and smells nice.",

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS THING AND IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY!It has saved me Sooooo much time! No more vacuuming the floors and then going back and washing them. It works wonderful and the floors feel so clean! I spilled an entire bowl of broccoli cheese soup, complete with chunks of broccoli....and the Tineco cleaned up the whole mess like it was NOTHING!The cleaning solution is expensive, but you truly only need a cap full, and it smells wonderdul! I also have two very low-pile area rugs, and I use it on them as well. It's not the same as a full rug shampoo, but it does the job!If there are any cons at all? There is about a 1/8th - 1/4 of an inch gap between where the floor meets the wall that it doesnt reach, but I have never found a vacuum that does, so that's expected.  I'll also say, when they tell you that after every single use you need to rinse out and pull apart the dirty water tank, and brush roller assembly? Don't skip it! Like most wet/dirty things, it WILL start to stink and get musty after only a day or two.....but I have left the clean water tank filled with water and cleaner for several days at a time and it's fine.So ZERO REGRETS here so far!

Don't forget to pop the roller out and clean it occassionally.Do NOT forget to empty the dirty water tank, though. You will regret it.

Ohio Inspire,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased and embarrassed at the same time!,the United States,21-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,We went into this purchase knowing that a lot of people were recommending this unit but I was blown away by the deep cleaning  capabilities of this wet dry vac.We decided to put it to the test and see if it was all true. We swept and mopped like we normally do. Waited till it was all dry and we ran the iFloor3 and we were surprised to see how dirty the water was once we finished running the iFloor3 WoW.A few things we wished were better is the battery and the clean water tank.Battery: the iFloor3 is small enough that they could have made it just a bit larger and put a bigger battery in it.Clean water tank: again it‚Äôs just to small. Needs to be a bit bigger so it has better holding power.I know I know there is a bigger unit that can accommodate but at a much higher price.Long story short WE LOVE IT.,
MC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend both the product and company!,the United States,13-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"First of all, the product is fantastic. It really cuts down our cleaning time. As an example, my one year old nephew enjoyed his birthday smash cake in our kitchen. Normally the resulting mess would have been a multi-step process, but with the Tineco we were able to clean the floor fast and easy!Second, Tineco‚Äôs customer service is equally awesome. I was very sad to see the price drop significantly on this product a week after we had purchased it. As per Amazon‚Äôs policy, they would not adjust the price. I contacted Tineco directly and they gave me a credit to their online store. I was able to stock up on the cleaning solution so I wasn‚Äôt out the price difference. I was very impressed with their service!",

I show this off to everyone who comes over and even make videos of me cleaning up messes my little ones make. It‚Äôs that good.Picture this. 2 year old throws milk, sticky rice, and applesauce on the floor. It effortlessly vacuums the food up and leaves a beautiful freshly mopped glow.My house has hardwood and tile. My floors are swept and mopped DAILY.Before buying this? I vacuumed. But mopped‚Ä¶. Very rarely.NO WAY could I keep my house up without this.Then it self cleans itself? I still take the brush apart and everything bc I want it to stay nice and perfect.JUST BUY IT.

katie freeze,5.0 out of 5 stars,Above & beyond,the United States,26-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Every house needs this machine. So I hate to mop. LOATHE mopping. I hate the bucket, I hate getting my hands wet wringing it, I hate having to keep dipping it in the new water and I hate cleaning it all when I‚Äôm done. This is a game changer for me as it vacuums AND mops (two birds one stone) and it self cleans. All I have to do when I‚Äôm done it hit the button, dump and rinse the attachments and set them out to dry. Mine is drying now in my photo. It picks up and mops everything well. I imagine when winter comes I‚Äôll be using it even more as now when people trample in snow, salt and mud I‚Äôll just use this to get it up instead of always having to have towels and wash them too!",
Cheryl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,the United States,11-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I am a huge fan of this machine. What an easy way to get your hard surface floors clean. It‚Äôs easy to use and cleans well. Gets a star knocked off because you can‚Äôt get close to edges. It‚Äôs almost a 2‚Äù gap next to walls or rugs. Also the ‚Äúvoice assistant‚Äù is irritating. You know how you‚Äôre ready to go home from work and you go to turn off your PC but then Windows decides you can‚Äôt close the system without doing a 20-minute update. This cleaner is sort of like that. You think you‚Äôre doing and putting it away and then you have to wait until the voice assistant tells you to do a cleaning cycle which can take 5-10 extra minutes. I just want to be done when I‚Äôm done.,
BoyMom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Momma‚Äôs to babies/ little kids a MUST BUY!,the United States,19-Oct-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Super easy to use. I love that I don‚Äôt have to sweep/vacuum before mopping up my floors. Now that my 1 y.o. is eating on his own there‚Äôs a mess on my floor after each meal. But this Mop/vacuum makes clean up easy and a breeze. I‚Äôm confident enough to let my LO crawl on the floors once I‚Äôm done using it. The concentrated formula provided works amazing!My only downfall is the small tanks but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker. I usually mop with a normal bucket and mop once a week for a ‚Äúdeep clean‚Äù and use my Tineco everyday twice daily and it‚Äôs holding up so far.I love it. You won‚Äôt regret. Suction is even better than a Dyson.I have the Dyson11turbo and honestly the suction on this Tineco beats it.Buy it now!,
Amethyst_nurse,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lovely product, easy to use",the United States,30-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the Tineco iFloor 3 -- Day one of use... First impressions:After having purchased and put this together (easy to assemble) I began to have doubts if it was a smart purchase for me. I was suddenly self-conscious about the fact that I have large area rugs and don't have as much space where I need to  clean hard floors as I use to. I was concerned that if it was very sloppy I wouldn't be able to clean right up around my rugs. Also, I began realizing how much furniture I normally sweep under, at very least the edges. I started to feel as if this might be something that you use and then still have to go back and ""clean the other half"". As doubts creeped in I let my new appliance sit on it's charging dock awaiting it's first use. Last night I had a bedroom I wanted to clean and decided it was time to give this thing it's first trial run. I used it without solution as I didn't have any sticky messes, spills, or extra muck to clean. This thing is amazing and addictive. I already never want to sweep and mop the old way ever again... It is basically self propelled so it kind of pulls you along naturally and easily. You put more effort in pulling it back to you. It swivels and maneuvers beautifully. If you're the type of person who gets irritated after sweeping because you hate that one little bit of dust you can't ever get in the dustpan, you'll love this. It has great suction and makes all dust and dirt disappear in one swipe and even seems to suction the dirt that is within a quarter inch (maybe more) of it's path. The design was well thought out because all of that furniture I knew I'd want to get under wasn't a problem. The head of this is not bulky and as such is able to better access under furniture than a standard vacuum. This leaves so little residue and dries very quickly. The floor appears more damp than wet after using this all-in-one cleaner. I was not at all concerned to clean right up around the edges of my rugs. Once I started, I just wanted to keep going. I ended up cleaning down the hallway and into my living room. I think that's always a positive sign. No, you probably cannot clean ALL of the way under your furniture without moving it. But I definitely did not finish feeling like I had to go back to clean my corners, under the edges of my furniture, or around my rugs. So that was a huge relief.My only con is that when you go to clean this out, it is very much like cleaning out a carpet cleaner... And there is going to be all of the chunky things and hair you swept off of your floor in your dirty tank. So, I was hesitant to rinse the dirty water tank in my sink or tub. I dumped the tank outside and decided to rinse in my tub. Then I had to wipe out my tub. I think in the future I may utilize a bucket of water to rinse out the dirty water tank so that residue can also be dumped outside. Really this is a small con... The dirt, hair, and mess had to go somewhere. And all of the pieces to the dirty water tank, clean water tank, and to remove the roller come apart and fit back together well. This does have a self cleaning option. But the tag instructs you to clean your appliance roller yourself after each use for best results. Perhaps the self cleaning option is meant for ""in between"" times of same day uses?Overall, this is easy to use, easy to assemble, easy to clean, well designed, and most importantly feels like it does a great job cleaning. It has great suction and maneuverability. So far, fantastic product.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greatest product I‚Äôve ever purchased-buy it now!!,the United States,28-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Hands down the best product I‚Äôve ever purchased. I did extensive research on this and it‚Äôs competitor the bissell crosswave, & I decided with this product based on reviews. I only wish I would‚Äôve bought this sooner. I have zero complaints thus far and I‚Äôve had it about 2 months and used it probably 30+ times already to do my entire house.-my house is 2200+ square feet and I can easily do my entire house on the basic setting (not the max) without the battery going dead. I sometimes have to turn on the max setting just to kill the battery so I can plug it in when I‚Äôm done.-my MIL purchased the bissell crosswave about a month ago and I used it to vacuum her house to compare. I like that the bissell does rugs, but it seems to push dirty water around the floor due to letting the user decide how much water is used while mopping where as the ifloor does all the work for you and doesn‚Äôt disperse too much water so you never push dirty water around. Bissell is a plug in and I didn‚Äôt notice a difference in suction power between the two which surprised me! The Ifloor vacuum will suction things off the floor that my dyson won‚Äôt even vacuum up.This is an amazing product, I waited a long time to purchase because i was skeptical due to the price. It‚Äôs worth every penny plus more!!",
Mary Curtis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product,the United States,1-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I love this thing!  I hate mopping because you have to lug water around I have a large house with loads of dusty hardwood flooring.  I was able to do my whole first-floor kitchen dining room study and front entry on one charge with time to spare.  The best part is how little water you need.  I did have to fill and empty the tank a few times but it's easier than the big bucket and mop. Love the self-cleaning feature. It is a little tricky to get the dirty water and cleaning bin back in but once you get the hang of tipping it a little to click it in you will be fine. I have had it for a couple of weeks. I feel comfortable recommending it highly I just got my mom one.,
GadgetLady,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE IT!!!  Replaced the Bissell Crosswave & I‚Äôll never look back!!!,the United States,23-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I bought 2 Bissell Crosswaves in 2 years, and they both had the same problems. Constantly stopping to indicate that the dirty water tank was full when it was empty, leaving black water on the floor, and both of the rollers stopped turning. I love the cordless floor wash & vacuum cleaner.  I don‚Äôt ever want to go back to a mop & bucket again.  But it was time to look for another brand, especially for $400.  I was hesitant to buy the Tineco because I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the brand, but the reviews convinced me.  I‚ÄôM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS MACHINE!!!  This is the one!!!I love how quiet it is, and how it just straight up does the job. No clogging, no stopping unless the dirty tank is really full, or the clean tank is really empty.  Self-cleaning, and self-propelled (a bonus feature that the Crosswave doesn‚Äôt have). I‚Äôm in love!!!!  I wish it had a variety of brush rollers (mop, scrub, etc.), but it‚Äôs not a gripe - just a wish list item. I like the display, which shows how much battery time is left before it has to be charged.  None of the machines of this type that I have researched so far have an exchangeable battery, so I just ordered another, less expensive Tineco iFloor model to finish the job when the battery dies.  I have 2 chihuahuas & I‚Äôm constantly cleaning the floor, and I need a floor cleaner that is reliable & works. This is it.  I just ordered more cleaning solution (a small capful goes a long way) & replacement brush rolls & filters. The only test now, is the test of time. I‚Äôm hoping to get 2 years out of it. If I do, then Tineco will keep my 5 stars.  For now, I‚Äôm thrilled!",
amorganfloyd,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning Floors Made Fun  & Easy.,the United States,15-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I love the Floor One 3. The deep suction is okay but the maneuverability is outstanding. Only thing is that the top tank doesn‚Äôt slide in easily and requires some effort to fit it into the socket. The self cleaner is very nice however water pools in the bottom tray. I‚Äôve contacted the company via email. Hopefully I will hear back soon. The Floor One 3 concept is great! Hopefully I can get a replacement soon to fully enjoy all of its features. I‚Äôve contacted the Tineco company regarding another product that stopped working after 3 or 4 uses. I like their products.

It has zero scrub, the brush is like wiping with wet dusting with a microfiber. So if you actually wanted to mop, forget it. Now seeing you can‚Äôt replace the battery on a $400 mop vac, absolutely not. That‚Äôs beyond a fail in design.",2
Kristen H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,the United States,29-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This product is amazing for our EVP/LVP and tile. It makes cleaning SOOO much easier. We vacuum constantly with little kids but used to hate mopping bc it was an extra step. Not only is it two in one so saves time, it‚Äôs just generally easier than the swifter/Bona type mopping.It‚Äôs also very light weight and the charge has never been close to running out (it‚Äôs easy to charge so it always fully charged between uses).It is important to be diligent about cleaning the dirty water tank but it‚Äôs easy to do.The only thing that is the same as typical mops is that you still have to separately scrape off anything on the floor that is sticky.

I LOVE IT!!!  I have a few dogs and this works amazing in leaving the floors clean and actually leaves a fresh smell in the room.  Very good quality.  The only CONS were that it does not get under the couch or in corners at all.  It also takes awhile to go through the final clean cycle when you are finished but overall I can handle that easily.

My only issue is that there is not enough cleaning solution to do a good amount of floor. Plenty of battery, not enough cleaning solution. The basic steps are: fill vacuum with cleaning solution, clean floors for 10 mins till it runs out, empty waste container, fill back cleaning solution, auto clean the rollers, empty the waste container again, fill the solution container again, continue cleaning floor for another 10 mins, repeat until floor is clean.

Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Changing Vacuum for Pet Hair,the United States,22-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I used to use a Roomba and then mop my floors after that.  The whole process was so time consuming.  In order for the Roomba to really work well, I basically had to move everything off my floors and onto my tables or countertops so it would not be impeded while cleaning.  And the Roomba would take over an hour to clear my whole 1st floor.  And once the vacuum was done, I'd have to mop and then wait for the floor to dry before putting everything back in place.  The Tineco takes about 7 minutes to both vacuum and mop my whole floor.  And it uses so little water that the floor dries almost instantly.  So I can just move my furniture out of the way while vacuuming and then put it right back.  It's so easy I use it several times a week and my floors have never been cleaner.  I own 3 cats and one dog so keeping my floors looking clean is a challenge.  And it cleans itself when you're done!!!  I will say that the first time I used it, I had not cleaned my floors for over two weeks and I had to stop and self-clean the vacuum about 4 times because there was so much animal hair.  And it would run out of water while self cleaning and then the dirty water tank got full several times and I had to stop to empty that.  It seemed like it was going to be a process every time I wanted to clean my floors.  But once I got the initial disaster that my floor was cleaned up, it's been really easy to maintain and it takes way less time to do my whole floor.  One tank of clean water will clean my whole floor, then I self clean the vacuum and empty the dirty water tank.  So easy.  I love walking around on my floors now in my bare feet.  Nothing gross sticks to the bottom of my feet anymore!!",

Does it deep clean? Well, if you've got blueberries stains or dried egg yolk on your concrete basement floor, it will not clean that. However, it does help to loosen the stains and makes them a little easier to scrub by hand, and then running the Tineco over it will help to dry the floor faster. Usually, I use this on my tile floor, linoleum bathroom floors, and quickly over my hardwood in the foyer and one powder room. For at least 5 minutes each day after I've finished running the Tineco over my floors, they are clean, and I savor the moment.",
Amanda Tucker,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product...but don't throw away your mop!,the United States,2-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I'll start by saying I'm a mom of three kids 6 yrs and younger with a stressful full-time job. Most of my Saturdays are spent cleaning my house and I'm always looking for faster, better ways to clean to get some time back. I have a 8 month old baby who is crawling and putting everything in his mouth, so I have been obsessive about my floors. In the past, I was sweeping, vacuuming, and then mopping my whole house, but I hated the idea of dipping the mop back into the dirty water. I was eyeing this machine for a while, thinking it could really help make my life a little easier, and I finally decided to purchase it.This Tineco machine is LIFE CHANGING. My floors are cleaner than they have ever been. I used this machine at least once a day, sometimes multiple times a day. I have a 2000 sq ft home with all tile, wood, or laminate, and I can clean all the floors in my house on one charge. The suction power is awesome and I love the fact that the dirty water goes into a separate tank. Here is a list of pros and cons I think are important to consider when purchasing.Pros- Dirty water goes into a separate tank- Good suction power- Cordless and lightweight- Can easily clean the entire machine, including the roller brush and roller brush cover- The machine tells me when I need to refill the clean water tank, clean the dirty water tank, and clean the machine-  Self-cleaning feature- Easy to useCons- Clean water tank is small, I have to refill it at least 3 times while cleaning the floors of my entire house- Cleaning the dirty water tank is a nasty job. I'm glad it's in the tank and not my floors. However, the tank has to be cleaned multiple times while cleaning my floors. I wish it was big enough that I only had to clean it once after each floor cleaning.- The brush is soft, so it's good for protecting hardwood floors, but even the max clean setting will not remove stuck on food or other stubborn gunk from your floors... you'll have to pull out the mop for that.- It obviously has its limitations. You won't be able to use this machine in tiny areas, like behind the toilet.- Fully charging the machine takes several hours.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this machine. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for two main reasons listed in the ""cons"" section; small clean and dirty water tanks, and the machine's inability to clean stubborn gunk off of the floor.I hope this review helps you make an informed decision.",
Maria,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every dollar,the United States,8-Oct-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was very nervous to spend so much money on this, but I can confirm that it lives up to the hype. It does its job well, and it‚Äôs horrifying to know the amount of dirt that has been sitting on my floors and was not getting properly cleaned by a traditional mop.The only caveat that I would add for somebody interested in purchasing it is that it does require significant maintenance both during use and after use. There are so many parts to it that need cleaned or accessed. You often will have to pause cleaning to empty the dirty water tank, and then the whole machine needs cleaned in between uses. If you have long-haired people or animals at your house, you‚Äôre going to get very intimate with all of the hair and debris on your floors as you manually clean the dirty water tank out. I think this process is worth it and would rather handle it than have it on my floors, but it is probably not for somebody who does not have a lot of energy or desire to prioritize cleaning, drying, and reassembling the device after deep cleaning the floors. That being said, I love it and highly recommend!",
Allison,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Product, User friendly, Cleans Perfetly",the United States,26-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,As many others have stated I am not one to typically leave reviews on something. This product right here is 100% worth it. When my wife originally started talking about getting one I thought there was no waaaay I was okay with paying that much money for a vacuum mop. I mean who has ever heard of such a thing. I just didn't see where it could be worth it. To keep a long story short my wife's parents bought her one for Christmas. We both couldn't wait to see how it would do. (Her being truly excited and myself wanting to see it flop epically) I have to say I was ultimately let down. (But in a good way) As she was cleaning the house with this thing there was hardly any water left behind (I thought to myself this little money box was not worth it.) However when I saw the dirty water in the tank  and how effortless it was to use my opinion changed. Annnd it self cleans? Whaaaat?? So as it turns out I like the little thing so much I brought it to work with me to show it off to my boss and try and convince him that I needed one to clean up our office floors. Our just came in today and it has not let me down. I have all ideas that my boss will be buying one for his home now. This is a must have item in my opinion for any home or office that has hard floors. I highly recommend this item!,

I will say that if I wait too long in between uses that I have to empty the dirty tank half way through because of the hair! I use twice a week and it is a game changer. The suction and maneuverability are comparable to my shark hard wood floor vacuum. The only thing I wish this had was a light on the front so you can see in dark corners!

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,19-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I am so disappointed in this vacuum. For the price, the self cleaning method should actually clean the vacuum‚Äôs inner piping. Every time I open up the dirty water tank I have to pick it up and put the vacuum in my sink and run water through the pipe that runs from the tank to the underside of the vacuum. Dirt and hair gets clogged in there. The roller brush gets musty and smells awful unless you remove it from the vacuum and scrub it in the sink with soap and water EVERY TIME. It does not end up saving any time. If you use it like you‚Äôd use a cordless vacuum (take it off the charger, go straight into cleaning, put it back on the charger when you‚Äôre done) the smell the next time you use it is awful. Even if you run self cleaning mode and empty the water tanks each time you use it, it will still smell awful the next use because of the clogging of the pipe and underside.For the way it cleans and works, it‚Äôs decent but 100% not worth the money. I‚Äôm going to contact tineco about refunding.",
DK3,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing sucks in the best way possible!,the United States,20-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I don't generally write reviews for stuff but I have to rave about the Tineco S3.  It is obviously very well made and actually as stylish as a cleaning appliance can be I suppose.  (i.e. wouldn't be out of place next to a Dyson) There was no complicated setup--just install the handle, take off some of the packing material, charge the cleaner, and fill it up with the water/cleaner mix.  I'm kind of one of those ""don't read the instructions"" kind of guys and all of it came together intuitively.  In use, it is very easy to maneuver and barely any water residue remains after going over areas.  This thing cleans very well too--just did a quick once over of our floors and the resultant dirty water tank was practically black.The only real negatives I can think of is that the voice is LOUD and I couldn't quite figure out how to shut it up until I installed the app and turned off the voice.  Also, there is some maintenance to it but it's nothing unreasonable for what it does.  My understanding the maintenance tasks are probably quicker to do than the Bissell Crosswave Max, for instance, so it's not really a criticism, just something you should expect as a user.  They do provide a spare filter and spare roller mop, so you can let the one you used dry out while installing a new clean, dry one.All in all, it's a very well thought out product and something we hope to use for a long time to come.",
Yasmine Elkady,4.0 out of 5 stars,No Streaks,the United States,30-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"We purchased this after watching countless videos on TikTok. I was convinced we needed it. We have hard flooring throughout our entire place so I didn‚Äôt mind the fact that it wasn‚Äôt usable on rugs and carpet. The only inconvenient thing I would say is that there is no vacuum only option.It does exactly what it says it does. It doesn‚Äôt leave any streaks behind, and the floor dries within seconds after. If you can make peace with the no vacuum only option, and have no need for it on carpet, I think this machine is worth the money.I only gave it 4 stars due to the no vacuum only setting, that would have made it the best floor machine on the market.",

The assemble process is very simple and comes apart easily for clean up. The machine hardly has any crevices for dirt and debris to become lodged in. Loved it so much I convinced several friends and family members to order it.My ONLY complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt clean directly against baseboards, cabinetry, and transition pieces on the floor. It leaves a 1‚Äù gap on the floor that isn‚Äôt clean.",

SoCalG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Changer,the United States,22-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Yes it‚Äôs a Game Changer!  Just on the time it takes to clean our living space alone is worth the cost of this product!  For maintenance and just day to day clean, we can‚Äôt be happier!  The self roller clean is so well thought out and the ease of operating it, I am glad to forget all the steps we had to go through in a traditional mops.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine not having this in our lives now that we have it.  What it seems took half of the morning to clean our tile floors once a week was a chore.  Now a quick 10 min is all it takes to keep your home looking great on a day to day bases.On the real though; to get close to perfect clean corners it‚Äôs best to do a periodic deep clean on grout and around toilet bowls.  For us a good hot dry steam mops quarterly is probably good practice.  I really wanted to throw out our sweeper and mop however, we chose to keep our mop just for utilizing it in tight areas or when using bleach and for cleaning bathrooms around the toilet bowl.  We kept the broom only to shuffle rouge crumbs.  No we threw out the broom!We‚Äôve used other liquid cleaner like Mrs. Meyers because we like the scent keeping it to just a cap full.",

Zero streaks, and look what it‚Äôs picked up in just 3 days and one room (I have 2 big dogs that run around the grassy backyard a lot, it‚Äôs not a mud pit). I have heart  issues that make it impossible to vacuum the house and then go back and mop it, which until now meant I was always behind on the dog hair and dirt. While I wish this guy had a bigger water tank and better battery life, boy does it make up for it in what it picks up and to be able to do both vacuuming and mopping in one step instead of two, means I can actually keep up on the maintenance.

Heather,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thrilled with this machine,the United States,28-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I am thrilled with how this machine cleans my bamboo floors. It‚Äôs easy to use and very easy to empty. I was hesitant to purchase because the directions say to use Tineco cleaning solution and I worried it would become costly. But it only requires a tiny cap full so the solution that comes with the machine will last me for a year I would guess. It‚Äôs very quiet and self propelled so using it is easy. I love that it‚Äôs cordless. I only have two rooms with hard flooring and I still had plenty of charge left after cleaning both floors. I don‚Äôt love cleaning but this is one of my favorite purchases. It makes doing the work so incredibly easy.,
Lyndsie Helsel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,the United States,6-Oct-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I think this is worth it. I have 2 dogs and a cat. Everytime I use it the water is practically black. It‚Äôs easy to use and assemble. Just make sure you do the self clean after every use and go in and clean it yourself after. If it holds dirty water/hair/etc it will start to smell. Which is expected. The stand is really convenient to hold everything and charge it. My only complaint is when you turn it off; it leaks a little bit if the dirty water so you just have to while that up. Doesn‚Äôt dull your floors or leave streak marks. Fries pretty fast. Does great with sucking up dog hair and getting rid of muddy paw prints. Have gotten multiple people to buy one.,
B Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a fantastic piece of equipment!,the United States,1-Oct-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"So far, Love it!  It is very easy to use.  Cleans my floors beautifully and runs a long time on one charge.  Have used it twice and am glad I bought it.  It has a very uniform cleaning path with no excess water left on my tile.  Area is dry within 2 or 3 minutes.  A full container of dirty water is proof of its cleaning ability.  Cordless is a beautiful thing.  Cleaning is very simple.  You do need to remove the roller brush and rinse and wring but the overall cleaning is much less than compared to other cleaners.  I've had a Bissell for years.  It was time for a new one.  Glad I saw the Tineco before buying another one.  Only thing I would like to see is a roller with a little brush bristle action to scrape the sticky smudges off my tile easier.  With the softer roller it takes a little longer to get them off.  I basically run over it and leave it wet a few seconds and hit it again.",

I originally wanted the Bissel Crosswave but saw a side by side video of the two and the tineco did a better job at removing the dirt. It also gets really close to the base boards so you don't even have to pull out the broom. There is a ""max"" mode the seems to suck a little harder so I use that in my high traffic areas. Its so quick to just pull this out and clean up that I actually don't mind cleaning.

I followed the directions of using a capfull of their cleaning serum with warm to hot tap water but it didn't the oils from human and dog feet off the floor. We have near black hardwood floor so it shows anything regardless but still, it allows me to see what is and isn't cleaning deeply. I also was a little sad that it couldn't clean edges.

This was very handy when I recently cleaned and scrubbed my bathroom floor tile grout with a scrub brush then used the Tineco to mop up all the residue. Saw several comparisons on Tiktok and Facebook comparing this machine to the Bissell that everyones raving about and the Tineco beat it each and every time. Favorite part is when I set it on the base and it cleans itself. Now all of our adult children want one for Christmas, so it looks like we will be buying at least three more!",

It does prompt me pretty frequently to clean the tank as my two labs have been shedding terribly lately so I am frequently stopping because of the quantity of dog hair it picks up.

I have a Dyson vacuum and it doesn't even compare to the suction power of this machine plus it washes the floor at the same time. It s just my husband and myself in our house and I thought I kept the floors pretty clean....guess not because the dirty water was BLACK. It is light, easy to use and the indicator lights letting you know you need more water or to empty the dirty water tank are easy to see.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thorough clean from a clean freak!,the United States,5-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"So I was planning to buy the Bissel Crosswave, but the Tineco iFloor3 was on sale so I sprung for it instead. And I have to say I am very happy that I bought it. I've named her Flo because she is simply amazing and deserves the honor of a name. I have vinyl plank through may whole house which is about 1900ish square feet. I do have some area rugs and the master has carpet, but other than that vinyl. I am a clean freak so I do go around the baseboards and sweep anything out from the wall to be completely sure I get everything picked up, but other than that no other sweeping or vacuuming before I use her. Flo did an amazing job of picking everything up, and there were some pretty big chunks of gravel by the back door. I have mopped for years using a shark steam mop, but my floors were so much cleaner after one use with Flo. My husband even commented that the floors looked cleaner so that is pretty huge! I will also say that this weekend my kids were playing in the mud and dirt and tracked it into my house and then left a ton of dirt and gravel in my tiled master shower floor. So I get Flo out to clean up the kitchen and bathroom floor and it donned on me that the shower floor is tiled so she can clean that too! She cleaned that shower in just a few minutes and my grout looks better than after I get down on my hands and knees and scrub it. (We have red clay in the yard, and light gray grout.) So I would say the overall use of the machine was very easy and takes a time consuming chore and cuts it literally in half. The clean cycle is very easy and requires a little bit of effort to do the maintenance properly, but isn't overwhelmingly complicated. The only thing I don't like is when my hair gets stuck in the dirty water cup and I have to pull it out, I hate touching wet hair, but I prefer this to using a traditional mop or the steam mop at this point. I will say you have to make sure you get the top back on the dirty water tank securely or it will not fit back into the vacuum properly and it took me a second to see where I did not have it lined up correctly. Other than that I haven't had any issues using it. I personally would recommend this vacuum to anyone, but I also think that you should do some research and learn about the product and the  maintenance so you have a realistic expectation since it is much different than any other mop I have used. Like any vacuum that requires maintenance for the filters and such the cleaning maintenance will have to be done after every use, which I don't find it to be hard, but I feel like the complaints that I have seen from others was due to not liking that maintenance process, or not doing it properly and having issues due to that. I would also like to add that I should really be getting commission from Tineco because I posted about Flo on my Facebook account and I have had 3 people buy one due to that post, and have had several more tell me they are planning to buy one soon!",
Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Floor Cleaner Amazing,the United States,22-Oct-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,So I need to start this review by saying my nick name is CCD because my friends say I have a compulsive cleaning disorder. So you can imagine what I thought when I took the the first picture and saw how much dirt came up in just one small sect of my floor. I never write reviews and I just had to write one for this product. It is light weight so easy to use. It cleaned my supposedly clean floors so well that my husband noticed. If you are mopping your floors like I was you are basically just moving the dirt around. This machine is AMAZING. It is worth the price.,
rudy777,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST invention,the United States,31-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I am obsessed with this thing. Makes cleaning up the floor after a messy toddler eats dinner a breeze. The suction power is awesome and based on the color of the dirty water, I'd imagine it's doing a good job cleaning my floors. My dad even walked into my house the day after I first used it and said ""the floors look brighter."" It moves super easily and does not leave a ton of water behind on the floor - it dries quickly. For reference, we have linoleum tile in the kitchen and bathroom (that is generally hard to clean because it's textured) and wood everywhere else on the first floor and it does a great job on everything.

This product has been just the solution to save both my sanity and marriage :)  It is easy to maneuver even for someone who is older without much strength, and with the low profile, it can get under table and chairs with ease.  The suction power is perfect for hardwood floors, and tile.  The automated voice that provides instruction for actions to be taken (self cleaning, changing water tanks, etc.) is loud and clear. Within the box the company provides an extra brush and filter which makes it convenient to swap out when the prior needs to dry after cleaning.

Jennifer A.

Reasons why: this vacuum doesn‚Äôt fit under dressers, bed, and other room furniture. Therefore, you have to move things out the way. When the vacuum is in stand positions as you move furniture out the way, it emits dirty water. Further making more cleaning. This vacuum/mop is probably more useful as a quick clean up because someone is coming over and not useful for deep cleaning.",
Cassie V,5.0 out of 5 stars,GET IT,the United States,12-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"The bissell crosswave is getting a ton of hype right now and seemed like something I NEEDED. Not only for easy clean up with dogs and kids but also to be easier on my body to cut cleaning time in half and not have to use so much ‚Äúelbow grease‚Äù, which often triggers tremors/spasms in my hands/arms.I had it in my cart even after reading some mixed reviews but decided to read more reviews on other sites and watch YouTube videos comparing etc etcI quickly removed that thing from my cart after seeing countless reviews and videos showing how fast it breaks down, it leaking, not sucking up the excess water and so on.Then I found this guy and mostly all reviews were extremely positive. Even one helpful YouTube video where the guy had THREE bissell crosswaves (because they kept breaking down and leakingüò≥) before he got the tineco floor one s3 and said it was far superior in every way.I bought it immediately.This is by far the best cleaning device and everyone with kids and pets needs it üôÉI just mopped a couple days ago and this thing picked up so much dirt and hair and overall nastiness it made it seem I hadn‚Äôt mopped in weeks. So satisfying ü§£It is extremely easy on the body too as it is self propelled and has suction comparable to a dyson.Oh and this thing is completely stupid proof, it tells(literally talks) you exactly what it needs and how to do it. You can mute it if you want but I‚Äôd rather it tell me it has a clog in the hose because of massive amounts of dog hair so I can quickly sweep it out rather than have a bigger issue later (ahem, bissell).Yes, it costs more.

ChelsJ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love my Tineco, but I‚Äôm so disappointed",the United States,22-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"As the title says, I desperately wanted to love this Tineco. I own a BISSELL crosswave so I‚Äôm familiar with using a vacuum/mop in one. I switched to a Tineco because I‚Äôve heard so many great things about them. I wanted a cordless one and I loved that you can change the suction level from auto to max. Overall the Tineco seemed like a better made, better functioning product. For the first two weeks it worked perfectly. I had a couple issues but nothing major. When I took it out of the box and was looking over it, I realized the little rubber piece on the bottom had a cut in it. As far as I could tell it didn‚Äôt effect the way it functioned, just something I noticed. I‚Äôve included a picture so you can see what I‚Äôm talking about. The other issue, it wouldn‚Äôt recognize the charging base. I‚Äôd have to remove the Tineco and replace it a couple times before it would connect and show that it‚Äôs charging. This randomly fixed itself after a few days. I didn‚Äôt change anything, but it started connecting immediately, no problems. Other than those few things I was obsessed with this machine. It cleaned my floors so well. It did leave them a bit more damp than the crosswave, but it cleaned much better so no big deal! I‚Äôve been very diligent about cleaning it and routine maintenance. Suddenly a few days ago the dirty water tank started leaking. While running it, water has started to come from around the bottom of the dirty water tank. I circled this in a picture to show where it comes from. It doesn‚Äôt happen all the time, so I thought the rubber seal wasn‚Äôt connecting properly or maybe I didn‚Äôt put the tank in well enough, but nothing I‚Äôve tried seems to change when it does or doesn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs also started to leave a streak of water from the left side of roller. I thought it was from the cut in the rubber, but it‚Äôs not since that‚Äôs on the opposite side. I‚Äôve checked to make sure there‚Äôs nothing on the roller or something caught at the bottom. I just can‚Äôt figure it out. It seems to make more of a mess now, because I go back to suck up the excess water only for it to leave another streak further left. I expected more than 2 weeks worth of use for such a big price tag.",
Cricket365,4.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum from the Gods!!!!,the United States,18-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this machine. My floor cleaning regiment has went from 2 hours to 30 min to an hour. I love how it detects if a spot is dirty. You just hold it over that spot for a few seconds and it tells you when its clean. I don't know if I would pay extra for the self cleaning feature, i like that it cleans the hoses but there is still a-lot of cleaning with the self cleaning feature. You have to take the rollers out after every cleaning or it gets a moldy smell if left over night but once the cleaning solution gets back in the sponge, the smell goes away. I am a very clean person but this vacuum gets everything my old vacuum didn't and sssooo much more. Nephew, spilled a drink, no problem, just vacuum it up and theres no sticky when i am done.

If you‚Äôre on the fence about which combination vacuum/mop to buy, this is the correct one.I had a Crosswave Premier before this and was rather dissatisfied with its cleaning performance. Most other people seemed to love it, so I thought maybe I was doing something incorrectly. It left my floors streaky, unevenly clean, and the suction left a lot to be desired (both for vacuuming and for water pickup).I returned that product and got this one for around the same price. The difference is night and day. I had last cleaned my floors with the Crosswave two weeks ago; after using this product once, the dirty water tank frankly looked embarrassing.It cleans evenly, extracts enough water that my floors are dry in minutes, actually has enough power to scrub significant messes, and it does all this while being cordless and having decent battery life. Note that I do have LiDAR-equipped robot vacuums (the Roborock S6) that dutifully keep most dust/dirt under control, but every couple of weeks I go over them with this product for a deep clean.I genuinely don‚Äôt mind cleaning my floors now, which is something I never thought I‚Äôd say.",

My first purchase was a pet bulky hard floor vacuum and after a few months it smelled when I would use it and wouldn‚Äôt pick up a lot. This vacuum was twice as much $$ but after my first use I was blown away. Here I am several months later still loving this machine. It‚Äôs easy to use and clean considering I‚Äôm pretty lazy when it comes to cleaning out vacuums. I love that the pieces are hard acrylic plastic, all you have to do is rinse it out. The cleaning solution it comes with is unscented but it really cleans muddy paw prints on the tile. The Max feature is great. The only negative thing I can say is the battery life.

It will pickup dog hair but this will slow you down having to dump dirty tank more often so I sweep first. All said I would consider this just a faster and more clean way to mop rather than a vac.Update: My cleaning tank had slow drip leak due to a failed seal. See attached pic. I have contacted Tineco support and they are sending warranty replacement.,
J P,5.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs good for what it is,the United States,26-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"First, this isn‚Äôt a miracle machine. It does seem to be useful though. A few things:Avoid resellers. I just got one for $299. Just wait till you can get it on prime. Resellers are making a killing in these at 400 plus dollars.Next, people that complain it leaves water...duh! It‚Äôs spraying water on the floor and sucking it up. Even a shop vac does that. It doesn‚Äôt leave much though.It‚Äôs very maneuverable, when it is running. It tends to pull when the brush runs.It does leave streaks. Not a deal killer to me but it does.It‚Äôs easy to clean.",
Nancy Wears,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning tool.,the United States,30-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I don't know what I did all these years without this floor cleaner. This thing is awesome! It takes just a few minutes to scrub the floor. No need to sweep first then mop. This baby does it all. I can scrub my entire house in 20 minutes instead of an hour or more. Cleans it self to. Highly recommend. Love it!,One

Brian Seal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a quick efficient clean,the United States,20-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Bought this during Prime Day on a recommendation from the previous home owner. So glad we did. While this might not be be great for true hardwood floors, the tile/lvt flooring love this vacuum. It lets me clean/mop out bottom floor in no time flat with no streaking and little to no down time. Love this thing and have bought the standard dry vacuum for my mom.Definitely use 2 cap fulls of the cleaner rather than 1 which is what the manufacturer suggests and stick with the Tineco cleaner.It also has connectivity to an app that allows you to monitor self-cleans and the vacuum charge. Would definitely recommend.",
Ashley Helt,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best wet vacuum I‚Äôve ever used!!!,the United States,9-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This thing is ridiculously AMAZING! I have hardwood floors and tile in the wet areas. We have two dogs and two messy little ones, I‚Äôm talking dog hair everywhere, toothpaste smeared on the bathroom tile, little spills constantly making the floors sticky.  This thing picked it ALL up. My floors look brand new. It‚Äôs self propelled and lightweight. Easy to push around and kind of fun actually. It tells you when to redock for a self clean. You do have to manually empty the dirty bin but it‚Äôs not hard. I‚Äôm so glad a friend recommended this to me. I love this more than the bissel cross wave pet pro (and I‚Äôm not sponsored to say that). The only thing that could be better is battery life. I have 1900 square feet to vacuum so the battery was flashing by the time I was done, but it never actually died.",
Resident,3.0 out of 5 stars,Step Up From Stream Mop,the United States,15-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"For $400, it works OK. Doesn‚Äôt get dried up pancakes off the floor (toddler finds.) Does not scrub grout. The suction pull is surprisingly strong! It did clean up dried pomegranate juice with ease. You can only use this brands floor cleaner. When the mop is stored after use, even after the self clean mode, it smells like mildew/dirty wet water. It‚Äôs definitely a mop you have to use and completely disassemble after EACH use. Definitely a step up from our Shark steam mop. Interested at the comparison to the Bissel crosswave.",
D. Davidson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy Peasy to Use. Lightweight and no mopping.  It talks to you too!,the United States,15-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Its fun to do and to only have to go over the floors once is a timesaver. I was amazed at how good it cleaned.  What I would like is a bigger tank container, as my floors are large and can't do in one passover without refilling a few times.  Also although it gets off most of the grime now and then a tough brush that you manually lower would be a helpful add for future models.  All in all I have never had a all in one mop and and most happy with the results of this one.  You do have to keep it charged so storage in my pantry without an outlet was problematic.  I have used on low carpet runners, tile and limestone.  Love the fact I'm not pushing around dirty water.  Recommend",
Alicia Richmond,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cuts cleaning time in half!!,the United States,5-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I absolutely love this vacuum mop! It cuts my cleaning in half and it's super easy to use! I use it on all my floors! There are two reasons I didn't give it a 5 stars. One the cleaning tool it comes with is SUPER HARD to open. I just keep it open now because it's impossible to grip and open which is not a deal breaker. Just annoying lolSecond and my biggest annoyance is it does not get edges. It leaves about an inch along the sides it may vacuum some stuff up but the mop for sure doesn't reach it so you have to wipe the edges yourself. I've tried many ways to get to them and it just doesn't reach the entire floor!I love how easy everything else is and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product! Just needs a tad bit work ‚ò∫Ô∏è,
Becky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yep!! This is the ONE!!!,the United States,3-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Yep!! This is the ONE!!! First let me say, I really researched and watched countless videos and could not find a bad review on this thing! So when it went on sale I jumped at the chance. I have cleaned every hard floor in my house with this thing and let me tell you, I am not sure I will use another mop!! The only ""complaint"" I have is that I wish the water container was bigger so it would last a bit longer. Same with the dirty water tank, other than that..GO BUY IT! If you have been thinking about it, just do it!!",
The Clan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bite the bullet,the United States,13-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"If your swaying on the fence about buying because of the price, bite the bullet.. well worth the money. I bought the top one with the bells and whistles. It mops and vacuum's at the same time. Cleans itself, and is so light. It takes off by itself so there is literal no pushing this thing, it will take you with it lol. Just a cap of the solution and it‚Äôs a small tank, I have 1500 square foot home, the solution lasts for the cleaning and do not have to refill. A bigger home might need a refill before finishing the floors. Wish it had an adapter for short rugs, I have vacuumed/mopped with this over my short rugs and no issues, not sure I recommend it(because it wets the carpet)  but it got my dog hair off of it hahaha anyways",

We have a puppy so we are in and out the back door often . I figured I'd mop the hardwood since I could see some shoe prints from taking the dog out. And oh boy I couldn't believe that our floors had just been mopped yesterday! Will update if I have any issues, but so far I'm sold. I didn't have any streak issues when drying like other people have complained of.",One
UCFWIZBA,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great until it dies,the United States,17-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I loved the ease of cleaning with this.

Kirby's umma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great design and so easy to clean! Self-cleaning?? Yes, please!!!",the United States,8-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I am just enamored with this thing. I'm just kicking myself for not finding out about this until now. I have been spot scrubbing my kitchen and other hard surface floors because mops just slosh the dirt around.I had a steam mop years ago that I used ONCE because the mop part was WHITE. Why would they use white? Of course I could never get it clean to its original state.My biggest concern was that the 20 minute battery life would not be sufficient, but 20 minutes goes a long way.I feel like I don't even need my Roomba anymore! But I will Roomba first to alleviate a big collection of dusk and my doggo's hair in the filter.The design is really well thought out and minus any rough handling of the parts, this wet vac should hold up as long as the battery lasts.",
Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hard floors,the United States,4-Oct-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I have enjoyed having this go to tool for cleaning my hard floors.  I replaced most of the carpet in my home with Vinyl Tile a couple years ago and keeping it clean has been time consuming.  I can pull this out and clean all the hard floors in a fraction of the time it took to sweep and mop the floors.  Also, I have a dog, so sweeping dog hair is an exercise in futility.  It just floats around in the air.  This tool picks the hair up and traps it, so no more chasing flying fur balls.  It does take more effort to clean, but not much more than cleaning all that dog hair off my broom and mop.  Very easy to clean, but there are a couple steps to keeping the dog hair cleared out.",
B. R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well on wood floors and tile floors,the United States,29-Aug-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"It arrived well-packaged with easy to follow instructions. It was very easy to assemble, and I was excited to see the battery had charge in it already. It only took a few minutes to assemble and I was pleased to see it came with extra parts.When I ran it, I liked how it adjusted the suction based on dirtiness. I have pets, so I decided to try to trick it. It amped up it's water output and suction near their food and water bowls, which I expected if it was working correctly. The amount of dirt in the dirty water tank made me determined to clean more often as it was pretty disgusting. It worked well on both my wood and tile floors.I'd definitely recommend this for people who have hard floor surfaces.",
George & Audrey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken! Huge mess!,the United States,30-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Great for about six weeks then wouldn't finish the self cleaning cycle and water ran out all over. Reached out, I had to send it back to them, which was a pain. They said they weren't able to fix it so they offered me a new one. After being without it for a month, the box I purchased for the return was delivered today with MY BROKEN VACUUM! I tried to call but they aren't taking calls because the call volume is too high. This would be a great product if it had worked. Very disappointed and frustrated.",One
Eliza,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning machine is time consuming,the United States,23-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"It was to good to be true. I'm a mom of 3. I did return it. I thought it would make my cleaning easier. You have to take all the pieces apart & clean them. Its very time consuming. It would just be easier to have swept & mopped. I can't take away though that it does clean very well, suction power is very good! If you have the patience to clean all the parts, than this maybe worth it for you.  I was so excited about this until I had to clean all the parts which has to be done everytime  after you use it. Also, puts to much water out for hardwood floors & left streaks.",
Amy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works better than my bissell,the United States,16-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"So far I like this one better than my Bissell. I gave it a three on deep cleaning because it still does surface cleaning, but does it well! At the end of the day, if you really want to deep clean on your floors you are going to have to go Cinderella style with the old mop and broom.The section is great my floors get cleaned and I really love that this has a self cleaning option which keeps the brush nice and clean. I will try to remember to come back and give an update after I‚Äôve had it a year or so.",
jman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Really wanted to like it,the United States,18-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Maybe my expectations were set too high. But I thought this be the end of having to sweep and swiffer every night. I have hardwood floors and 3 kids which means messes. If there‚Äôs anything sticky that‚Äôs been there a while this doesn‚Äôt really help. And if there‚Äôs anything taller than the front then it just pushes it around.Then let‚Äôs not forget the maintenance required. Like adding solution and washing out the junk from the collector. If you appreciate this thing then good on you. But it just wasn‚Äôt for me.,
Kindra,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT! Definitely recommend!,the United States,13-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I bought this due to having a white German Shepherd who sheds constantly and a senior cat who pees on the floor because of her declining health.PROS: perfect for daily cleaning of my hardwood floors! I love that I can finally clean my floors in just one step instead of vacuuming and then moping. It used to take FOREVER especially with all the white turfs of hair everywhere. We also love it for deep cleaning the area our cat pees at after we clean up and spray the area. It also does great picking up cat litter! I love how it‚Äôs self cleaning and that it has a charging station. My fianc√© and I both say it‚Äôs one of our best purchases!! Saves so much time and keeps our floors clean. The ‚ÄúMax‚Äù mode is great for picking up stuck on items and spills. The display on top is great too, it tell you when the dirty water tank is full, the cleaner tank is empty, when it needs to be self-cleaned, etc.CONS/Areas that could use improvement: it can‚Äôt pick up too much hair at the same time or it gets caught in the wet roll brush and I have to manually unclog it. But, it‚Äôs pretty easy, you just pop the guard off and pull it out. Also if you have fur babies you‚Äôll have to self-clean it a lot if you don‚Äôt vacuum daily. I also wish it could get closer to the edge when cleaning against walls/items but I saw the more expensive version does but I couldn‚Äôt afford the extra $100 it costs for that and voice command.Overall, I love it and consider it one of my best adult purchases!",
Marah M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt hesitate just buy it!!! Total game changer!,the United States,8-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Let me just start by saying I do not write reviews often unless I feel really strongly about something. Absolute best purchase I‚Äôve ever made. A huge game changer. This thing does wonders for our floors. The suction power is absolutely amazing. I have a Dalmatian and the amount of dog hair has been overwhelming and nothing has picked it up like the Tineco. I‚Äôve had a Bissell crosswave before and it would just push the wet dog hair around. My floors are shiny after using and feel so clean on our feet! The floors dry quickly too because the Tienco doesn‚Äôt soak your floors which is a huge plus when you have laminate flooring. This has saved so much time. I actually enjoy cleaning my floors now.,
Ryan Wolf,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great Christmas gift idea.,the United States,11-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,This thing is a game changer. My kids want to help clean the floors now. It is so easy to use and it sucks up many things my cordless fusion wouldn't suck up. I love that it mops while it vaccums. Such a time saver. I used to sweep/mom/sweep to get my floors looking as good as this Tineco does. If you have the money I‚Äôd go with this one over the model a step down. The app and the talking to you features make it really easy to remember to clean everything and have it ready to go for next time. Plus it comes with an extra brush.,One
Kaitlyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're thinking about it, just do it!",the United States,4-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is awesome. I can do my whole apartment and still have 80% battery power left. The canister is not very large so I do usually have to empty it and refill the reservoir before self-cleaning, but I love all the features this vacuum has and it makes my floors so clean. The canister IS large enough to hold all of the water for vacuuming my apartment, just not for the additional water used in the self cleaning.The cleaning solution also has a nice clean scent but is not over powering. The bottle has lasted me quite a long time",
Mom_poet_love,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely worth it!,the United States,31-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"So, I have kids and dog. This has definitely lighten my work load. Wonderfully easy to use, and clean, does an excellent job on my area rugs as well as tile, and linoleum. I agree with other reviews, its not good for that deep clean, but it makes sweeping/moping so much easier, it can be a daily task easily. Also makes quick work of those little kid (and puppy) spills and messes. Its quieter than I expected and self clean and cordless makes all the difference. Will update review as time goes on, but if your looking for a vacmop, this is one, imo",
Prdmom22,5.0 out of 5 stars,First use blew me away,the United States,23-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,In a household with 5 kids your floors can get dirty fast. I grabbed this highly recommended machine on a prime day sale. This little machine can clean up supper crumbs and spills in a jiffy. The majority of my home is hardwood and it cleaned then all on the normal setting. Used the max a few times on a few areas. Had almost half of the battery life left. This thing would be great in beach condos and campers. The self cleaning function is great! Hopefully it last as it‚Äôs my new favorite gadget. Will update after a few months.,
Andrea D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just do it,the United States,5-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical about spending this amount of money for mopping, but it has been one of the best investments!  I HATE mopping, and this has made the process so much easier.  No nasty mop to ring out, no nasty bucket of water...ugh!  I debated between Tineco and competitor, but after researching, decided to go with this one.  Felt I was getting 'more bang for my buck'.  If you have more than a small area to mop, bet this!  My 2100 sq ft house only has carpet in the 3 bedrooms, and I can mop the whole thing in no time now.  Also, the fact that it dries quickly, doesn't give my 3 furbabies a chance to leave their prints.",
Kindle CustomerPatricia,5.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend this product. So easy to use.,the United States,30-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I received this as a Christmas present and just recently tried to register it. I had problems registering it. The support person for this product responded quickly but I‚Äôm old so I called my youngest daughter and she got it done for me. The support person was very nice and helpful. I used my vacuum cleaner for the first time yesterday and it was awesome. It‚Äôs easy to maneuver and very light weight and cleaned my kitchen floor better than any other cleaner I have used. It cleaned the  tough spots on my hard wood floors with ease. I would highly recommend this product.,
Cindy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this product, but the tanks are small.",the United States,20-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I have wanted one of these for years. I am overall really happy with it. The cleaning is great, its easy to use, light weight. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the water tank and dirty water reservoir is way to small. I have a very small house and I can only do my small living room and bathroom before it needs to be dumped. Doing the whole house I have to dump it twice. Then when it's on the cleaning cycle to clean itself I have to dump it once if not twice more. That's kinda annoying but it cleans very well. We have wood tile throughout our home.",
Connie Kabugo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Purchase!,the United States,12-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I've only written two other reviews, which were google reviews, so it goes to show how much I like the Tineco Floor One S3. It's easy to unpackage and put together and easy to use. It's also lightweight and self propelling. It makes cleaning so much fun that my 9 and 5 year old boys are excited to keep their room clean so they can use the new vacuum/mop (of course with adult supervision because this thing isn't cheap!). Every room in my home has wood flooring. I tried the Bissell Crosswave, but it was too loud and left a lot of water on the floor after mopping, so it was returned.  With the Tineco, I can clean every room with one charge, it's fairly quiet, and doesn't leave a lot of water on the floor, which makes minimal drying time. Great product. I hope it lasts a lifetime.",One

My back didn't hurt ONCE and I did my entire house.2.  It's so easy to use and operate, my kids could (and WILL) do it!3.  It has amazing suction power.  AMAZING.

CatWilliams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the $$,the United States,11-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Love! This product. Easy to clean after use. At $300 it was a bit much for me to spend. But it is so nice to just run underneath the kids seat after dinner or meal time and it picks up everything!!! Leaves the floor clean. Only drawback I have is that it doesn't get right next to the baseboard. But only like a half inch of space.  If you're deep cleaning this would be great to run over top first and last. Overall, we use it everyday. Does not need a lot of solution. The battery lasts me about an hour of straight use. It does also charge pretty fast. It's not recommended to use on carpet, but it does also get up small stains. Comes with an extra filter but not an extra roller. If you plan on using it everyday I would recommend getting extra.",

I can wipe floors with papertowel a day or 2 after using tineco and paper towel is still white!  So easy to use! Battery lasts for entire house, can handle area rugs, dog hair, human hair.  The inly things i wish i could change is larger clean water tank, that it could get closer to corners/edges, i wish it would function under beds or low furniture but the roller lifts off floor and doesnt clean.

I was disgusted with the dirty water this mop was pulling from my floors. Our floors were so past due for a deep cleaning it‚Äôs taking a few times to get them very clean. All the reviews that you see saying it leaves streak marks on the floor is probably because it is very dirty from never been thoroughly cleaned.

In my 30s and my floors have never been this consistently clean lol why didn't they have these when i had little babies and zero energy to mess with mopping ?I knocked it a star for deep cleaning.

Not only can you see the dirty water get all sucked up, but you can see the difference between a mop and the Tineco. The only issue is how small both tanks are, and doesnt reach about 1"" away from the baseboards or anything around it.

I was looking into purchasing it, but the customer reviews did not sound promising.  The machine was not inexpensive.  So I gave up, until I saw something about this Tineco machine.  Every rating was 4 star and the reviews were promising.  I really love it.  It is easy to maneuver and simple to operate.  Customer service is excellent; although I have not had to use it, they reached out several times after my purchase to see if I needed any support.  The machine is also more affordable than the Bissell.  I recommended it to my son-in-law, and he really loves it!  He uses it almost every day and has nothing but positive things to say about it.

Jackson K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you hate mopping and can afford this, buy it",the United States,10-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"It did a great job cleaning my hardwood. The unit appears to be designed pretty well for both effective cleaning and easy maintenance. The tanks are small, but unless your floors are coated in something sticky, it will clean the floors fine with a few quick passes and it's very water efficient so they last a while. It even sucked up the dog hair no problem (I have a husky) and it gets caught on a trap in the dirty tank. The little charging base/self cleaning tray is great, too.The only real negative I have is that I would have like a corded option that was a little bit cheaper.",

This awesome device makes it easy.You don't need to get out the mop and bucket and soap and broom and dust pan. You don't need to sweep the floor first.You just grab this thing and make a couple of passes with it and you are done. Picks up wet and dry and mixed wet/dry spills (think broken ketchup bottle).Set it back in its self-cleaning tray, empty out the dirty water tank, and you are finished. No sweeping, wringing, rinsing, or mixing. This problem is now solved.",
Ashley Z,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for light cleaning, not deep cleaning",the United States,14-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I do like it and think I will keep it but it‚Äôs not as life changing as all the reviews claim. I would say it‚Äôs good for light cleaning daily but not for stuck on tough dirt or spills. If something is left there to harden it‚Äôs not coming off easily with this guy and it takes many many passes to make the floors clean. I used it on smooth tile for reference. It is good at vacuuming but didnt grab big chunks (like dog food kibble). So i think I will still steam mop to get the deep clean and then maintain with this guy during the week,
Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TikTok made me buy it, and I‚Äôm SO glad it did.",the United States,18-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôve never written a review on Amazon before but felt compelled to after playing with my new Tineco all day.What I love about it:-I no longer have to vacuum AND swiffer my floors-This gets your floors really, really clean. Like, I thought I had clean floors before, but no. I didn‚Äôt.-lightweight-cordless-it talks to you!-easy to maneuver (it feels self-propelled, like if I let it go it would just move on its own)-dispenses the perfect amount of liquid at all times-it self-cleans the brush head-easy to fill the clean water tank, and easy to dispense the dirty water tank-slim vacuum head, so it fits under my cabinets & furniture easily-good suction-quiet (for a vacuum)-has a rubber protection around the vacuum head so it won‚Äôt scrape baseboards while you try and get as close as humanely possible so that it *might* just pick up edge grime (see below)What I don‚Äôt love about it:-long charging time-the dirty water tank is HUGE for how little it holds before it wants you to empty it-does NOT do edges at all. About a 1-2‚Äù gap.I couldn‚Äôt decide between this and the bissell crosswave, but after watching 1048292 tiktoks, I went with this because it seemed a little slimmer, seemed to have better suction, didn‚Äôt leave puddles of water when turned off, and had a smaller head so it fits under cabinets and furniture easier. Everything I saw has proven to be true so I feel like I made the right decision. It‚Äôs also not streaky at all, which was a common complaint I saw with the crosswave.When I say ‚Äúmy floors have never been cleaner‚Äù, I mean it. Not only are they SPARKLING, but they FEEL clean. I‚Äôve been paying for a maid service for years and while I always thought my floors were impeccable each week after they worked their magic, they have never looked or felt this good. They didn‚Äôt even look or feel this good when they were first installed 4 years ago. It‚Äôs unexplainable.This is so easy to use and I‚Äôm obsessed with the app that you can download. Idk why, I just think it‚Äôs so fun to see how much longer until it‚Äôs fully charged, how much I‚Äôve used it, and to have it ‚Äúself-clean‚Äù with a push of a button on my phone.If you‚Äôre wanting to get this, just do it. It‚Äôs great. Yes, I listed 3 cons, but I‚Äôm still giving it 5 stars because the pros outweigh everything else here.",
Kyle C.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Battery Problem,the United States,2-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Sure the mop and vacuum is nice since it's 2 in 1 but what about the battery. I had no problems with the vacuum as it worked as intended but the mop was a bit problematic. Sometimes, it would get no spray the water our or the filter wasn't working as intended. but the biggest issue I had was that the battery was way too little to be useful. It lasted about 10 mins while on max which seems a bit too short. Also having to change the water so often makes the machine a hassle to use.",

CHRISTOPHER SEWELL,5.0 out of 5 stars,My floors have never been cleaner!,the United States,18-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This product exceeded my expectations! My floors have always felt and looked dirty, streaked up,and hazy with other floor cleaners. But after using the Tineco One S3, they look as clean as the day they were brand new! It takes a few, initial cleanings to get there. But each time you use it, you can immediately see that the dirty water tank gets cleaner and cleaner, after each use. When our wooden floors were finally to the point of CLEAN, keeping them in a clean state has been EASY and effective.  I highly recommend this unit for cleaning wooden floors.",

It was recommended by one of my friend from my local mommy group. They brought this months ago, and it work wonderful with her toddler who like to throw food and spill drink on the floor.I have been using this for month now, and it does good job cleaning the fresh mess my 1 year-old makes. But just beware don't let the food get fry on the floor, it might be little difficult to get it out.I like that it is cordless so i don't have to drag a cord through the mess. It isn't very heavy and it also self-propelled, which makes it so easy to push around. Just need to teach my daughter how to use it!",One

tj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Day 1 and its working great.,the United States,20-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Bought this when there was a small discount available during Prime Days. I was on the fence about it because it is still so expensive. But i told myself if it didn't absolutely wow me on day 1, i would return it for a full refund. Just used it for the first time and I am definitely going to keep it. We have a tile kitchen and then wood floors throughout the rest of the house. Sweeping and mopping the kitchen, then sweeping and delicately cleaning the wood has been such a hassle. This cut my floor cleaning time in half (or probably even by more) and picked up dirt significantly better than sweeping. After the first use, the water I dumped was basically black and the floors looked great.It is much more expensive than I am comfortable with but I think its worth it because its going to make life easier and give me more time to spend with my family. I'll pay a little extra for those benefits.The big con i noticed is that it was hard to use on my tile steps. I will probably keep the swiffer and mop for that area.",
Johnnie T.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, worth the money",the United States,1-Oct-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical when I first saw this product. However an acquaintance of mine had bought this and had nothing but great things to say. I have a house with a footprint of over 3000 square feet....all wood floors and tile in bathrooms. So it would take me hours to sweep/vacuum the floors then mop. This is a game changer! This product picks up debris amazing (I have a toddler so you can imagine the things dropped on the floor) and mops the floor at the same time....my routine is cut in half.I have a limited number of cons. 1 was a defect in my clean water tank....it had a slow leak in the seam BUT when I contacted the company they were VERY helpful and replaced my tank with no Hassel! Another con is battery life. I cannot clean my whole house on one charge....so I normally split it up and do the bathrooms and bedrooms....charge....and then the kitchen and other living areas. My last con which I would say is more of a suggestion is a larger clean water tank. I have to refill the water and cleaner around 4 times during the process. That isn't a huge deal....but could definitely be an improvement.Overall, I love this product!",

I love this thing, I haven‚Äôt swept or mopped in weeks. It cleans really well, I use it as a daily cleaner. I would recommend deep cleaning with a broom and mop every once in a while still. I don‚Äôt really have any complaints. It‚Äôs self propelled, discharges the clean water for you and the suction is great. It works on my tile, hard wood and laminate flooring throughout my house.

Craig Glick,3.0 out of 5 stars,Keep these things in mind!!!,the United States,28-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Not what I expected!! I have ceramic tile, and young kids, who ya know, make sticky messes. I am sure if you caught the sticky mess right away this would be great, but I work full-time away from my home. By the time we get around to running it, the wet mop part is rendered almost useless. So definitely don‚Äôt expect it to perform miracles on your floors... you‚Äôll still have to sweep or run a dry vac for most of your floors, use another mop for a deeper clean, then use this. We run a robot vac throughout the week, then this on the weekend or as needed.Another pet peeve is how crazy fast the dirty water tank fills up before you have to empty it out and clean it out too.Last pet peeve, the battery run time. The battery on eco mode (a harder scrubbing action) last like 15 minutes of run time.The one big thing I do love is the suction power for the liquids. The floor dries incredibly fast! Follow this by the self cleaning feature.These gadgets are promising, but haven‚Äôt quite reached where it‚Äôs supposed to just yet. This is a great quick floor mop to maintain everyday, but don‚Äôt expect this to be some heavy duty machine that takes all the burden of vacuuming and mopping in one go!",One
DaMaDo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly surprised,the United States,29-Jul-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Bought the Floor One S3 to try it and it's been surprisingly good. It can't get really dried stuck on stuff, but it removed stains a plumber created that didn't seem to come off with anything else.One tip is make sure you don't use too much of a foamy soap. We use thieves cleaner but just a little or lots of foam happens.Also don't use it or clean it without the filter installed or too much water comes out and makes a mess. This may only be an issue in this automatic adjusting one.Their video on cleaning is good and true to form. It's easy to clean which means I use it a lot more.",

I‚Äôve been waiting since before Christmas for it to be in stock again. It just came in yesterday. I charged it and got to work and it is life changing. It‚Äôs so quick, easy and fairly quiet so I don‚Äôt wake my light sleeping kids upstairs. The main downfall is the small water tanks for the clean and dirty water as well as the battery life. But as long as you use and clean your floors regularly, there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt clean 1,000sqft house in the amount of time of the battery life. It‚Äôs so convenient compared to sweeping and then mopping and does a much better, as well as quicker, job. It‚Äôs worth every single penny and cleans amazingly.",

The self propel feature is good but I feel my arm being pulled a bit. But everything else outweighs this tiny inconvenience for me.  It's super easy to clean too. Self clean cycle is also very quick.

It was packaged really well, and was simple to assemble. It has a little bit of charge right out of the box and I was able to get my office and living room floors clean before it ran out of charge. THIS THING IS AMAZING!  It only took about 10 minutes to do those 2 rooms(and the hallway in between). It picked up ALL of the dog hair, popcorn kernels(which my upright vacuum would never pick up) and mopped the floors at the same time. The floors feel cleaner than they have in a long time. My upright vacuum didn't work well on hard floors, so I had to sweep with a broom and dust pan, then I would have to mop with my steam mop. This would take me a couple of hours to do just the main rooms in the house. With the iFLOOR3 it will cut that down to 30 minutes to an hour. I will update after I have had the vacuum for a longer amount of time so I can tell how it holds up.",

I was amazed because usually when I mop the floors then dry up with the towel its dirty...not anymore. I use this on tile and hardwood with no trouble. I def recommend you empty it out and self clean it and dry out the roller after each use to keep the roller nice and fresh...def don't want it souring. Highly recommend this product!,

Also, it needs to self clean too often, we have no pets or children in our home, just two adults but sometimes the self-clean light comes on after just a few minutes.

I am not one of those people. If it is designed to make cleaning feel less like... well... cleaning, I am going to fall for it.I have owned two bissel crosswave vacuums, over two years.

The tomato juice in a Bloody Mary.  The tonic to Tineco‚Äôs gin.Tineco is east to assemble, compact, and uses very little water and solution. While I thought ‚Äúthe other one‚Äù leaves the floor somewhat dry, the S3 leaves all others under water by comparison. There wasn‚Äôt even time for the dogs to run through and visibly ruin my minimal work.Speaking of lack of effort, this is a self propelled wonder. The moment I pushed the power button, I was basically just along for the ride. It‚Äôs so easy my kids can do it. They won‚Äôt. But they could.I just cleaned my floors yesterday with the BC but today‚Äôs dirty water tank was dirtier than a 13 year olds browsing history. The led display had me stop several times when it discovered a spot of extra disgrace. I decided to run a second pass through the living room and the water was nearly clear. Someone on Naked and Afraid definitely would have boiled it and drank it.While the best device would still be a self cleaning house, this new best friend (yes, it even talks to you!) is clearly going to get heavy use for at least the next three months when I remember we do still live here and daily cleaning is only an exercise in futality.",

If you have a pet you 1000% need this product. This product is perfect for those that need a vacuum/mop but aren‚Äôt able to use a steam mop because of floor texture (vinyl). This mop gets the floors as wet as a mop and dries quickly. There is no steam feature for this products. The only down side I have found for this product is you are suppose to purchase their brand cleaner and it has been sold out for months due to this product blowing up on tik tok. Their warranty does not cover using alternative products. Also if you do not clean out the dirty water tank and dry out each piece after use it will mold.,

No button to tilt the body like a vacuum cleaner, just hold the head still and pull the handle towards the floor. Gets into tight spots very easily. It will practically drag you across the room if your not prepared. It does require some frequent cleaning but it also does that itself for the most part.

skye,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy,the United States,30-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I really love my tineco mop thing. I don't ever do reviews but I'm doing one now. I included a video to show how it works for me. I usually don't spend this kind of money on stuff like this because I'm a single mom but I decided to splurge. It was definitely a good buy. üëçIt vacuums and mom's at the same time.The only down side is when it's time to dump the water üíß it's so gross but it's better than having it on your floors. Now they need to invent one to clean walls and ceiling fan blades. Does get to corners or edges but good for everyday messes.Overall I give it a 9.1,
A. Thompson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Died after first charge,the United States,8-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"It cleans great, it charged up the first time just fine. I used it for about almost an hour until the battery died using the max cleaning (I like my house to be clean thank you very much), and it did great on the cleaning. Once the battery gets down to 20% however, it does this annoying countdown, and freezes at 1% until the battery dies like 10-15 minutes later.After that however, my Tineco Floor One S3 adamantly refuses to charge (basically, it charged once and hasn't since then), and I've spent days going around and around with Tineco support. They keep telling me to check the same things over and over again like that's magically going to change since the last time they asked. They're completely unconcerned about fixing a faulty product.Update: It appears if you attempt to call them, you just get a recording saying they cannot accept your call, and to use live chat (which doesn't really exist) or submit an email ticket, which is what gets you in an endless loop of ""check the pins, check that it's plugged in, etc."" and then they wait 24 hours+ to actually respond again after you reply.",
Kristina Shoemaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product,the United States,3-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I waited awhile after I used this a couple times to write my review. This by far is the best cleaner I have had! My floors are all ceramic tile and I‚Äôve went through about every cleaner there is including the crosswave. Very little assembly and very easy to operate! The only complaint I have about this product is the water tank is kind of small so you have to stop to refill often but worth every penny! If your thinking about a purchase let me make your mind up because I am a picky person with OCD and this passed all my tests!,

I‚Äôve even had friends over to see how wonderful it is. I‚Äôd even sell it door to door like in the old days‚Ä¶.never have I been so enthusiastic about a product. It is pricey but worth every penny.I have not been asked by anyone to write this review. It is genuinely from the heart.

Lindsey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Parts broke-no customer service,the United States,1-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this vacuum mop.  However it‚Äôs been leaking since I got it.  Somehow the seams of the plastic cleaning solution cup has a crack or something and it leaks. So I end up wasting so much product and water because it leaks the whole time I vacuum, and when it‚Äôs charging. I tried contacting customer service and the email was returned to me.  Called the number and left a message but received no call back.  I would give this all 5 stars if I could get the parts replaced, but alas, the vacuum lasted one week before breaking and it‚Äôs becoming too costly to replace the cleaning solution so often in order for it to work.",One
Megan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Less impressive over time,the United States,14-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I wish it held more clean water, and that the water could be hot. Also wish that it didn‚Äôt have to be emptied after every use. It‚Äôs kind of an ordeal to empty the dirty water tray because you need to pour it in the sink, and throw it away. If you don‚Äôt clean the dirty water tray after each use it will stink. It works great, our floors have never felt so clean. Just these few things that make it a little inconvenient to use. It surprises me at the amount of stuff it picks up, even tough to remove dried food in the kitchen will come up but it might take a little longer than most things. The floors feel buttery smooth when I‚Äôm done.Update - I find myself cleaning out the dirty water tank so often, I dread using it. If I knew what I know now, I would not have purchased. If the dirty water tank sits, it smells terrible. I have been going longer and longer in between using because the dirty water tank gets so nasty so easily. Too much maintenance.",
Shellbell56,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever,the United States,5-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I have almost all hardwood or tile floors. I have spent an inordinate amount of time mopping and sweeping. Then my daughter told me to get one of these and my life changed. It takes almost no time to clean all my floors. I have been a bit appalled at the color of the water in the dirty tank but it's getting less disgusting the more I clean.  Having 2 dogs and 2 cats makes for some grubby and hairy floors. Not anymore! It doesn't do carpets well so I don't use it for the one room that has that. But I LOVE THIS THING!!!,

The dirty water tank and the clean water tank are kinda annoying to snap in. Corner cleaning is difficult but I still love it. I do have a rainbow vacuum I use to vacuum my hardwood floors first so this is strictly used for mopping but this is a gray product and it has a good price point I think.,One

This gave me back 4 hrs/mo of free time. It used to take me 3hrs to mop/dry my apartment‚Äôs hardwood floors from start to finish. With this cleaner, I can do the same job in an hour. The only drawback is you don‚Äôt get that freshly cleaned pine sol smell like with the mop. But that‚Äôs probably better for my lungs anyway. Can‚Äôt comment on deep cleaning as my place wasn‚Äôt nasty to begin with. Overall I‚Äôm happy with the performance of this cleaner. Wholeheartedly recommend.",
Douglas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Beats Wave and Floormate, hands down.",the United States,5-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Best wet vac I've owned so far, I've also owned a Bissel Wave and a Hoover Floormate. The Wave didn't clean very well and lasted just over a year while the Floormate cleaned fairly well, had good suction, but dumped a lot of water on the foor, was extremely loud and lasted less than 6 months before the motor rusted out. I've had the Tineco a few months now and it is by far the best. It is comparatively quiet, cleans very well and leaves little water behind. It is light and sleek. I wish the fresh and dirty water tanks were larger and would prefer it to be corded so I don't have to worry about battery life; however, you can get through at least 2 fresh tanks on the max mode with the battery and you can cover a lot of ground in that time. The self clean feature is awesome and I usually run 2 cycles so the water is nearly clear. Easy to disassemble for more thorough cleaning. Tineco, please sell a disinfectant cleaner!",
Josue Gomez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Now I'll finally mop my floor regularly!,the United States,21-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I've always hated the work involved with mopping. From digging out the mop bucket, filling it with water and solution and lugging around the bucket around while I do the job. I used to mop MAYBE once a month, now I'm running the Tineco every other day or so. This thing is so much easier and really simple to use. I especially love that I don't have to sweep the floor prior to mopping since it can also vacuum. Very well worth the time it saves.Cleaning it is a bit tedious, but still overall a much better experience than using a regular old mop. It also dries much faster since it doesn't leave as much moisture on the floor even after several passes. The dirty water tank fills up fairly quickly, so sometimes I have to dump it out before I finish cleaning all of my floor. Using this in addition to a robovac is keeping my tile floor clean all the time.",

This does a great job and gets the floors really clean.  My only complaints are there is a bit of a gap between the wall and where mopping ends and the water reservoir is on the smaller side and sometimes needs to be changed mid mop. It does a great job cleaning up after a malamute and keeping all the dog hair off the floor. Overall l, I love it and it cuts my cleaning time in half.",

Sweeping or swifering prior to using the mop enhances its effectiveness but is not necessary for me personally. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have pets or kids.",One
JBug1957,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cordless and powerful cleaning is a breeze,the United States,10-Aug-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Love it.

Love that it is cordless makes cleaning a breeze. I had a bissell before that broke so I thought I would try this . I am very happy so far and love the technology that it comes with. You don‚Äôt need to order an additional bottle of cleaner right away. It comes with a small bottle but only a careful is needed for each tank full.

Quickly clean up spills and vacuum and mop the hard floors.  It is lighter than the bissell, quiter and does a better job.  Plus, it is cordless.

What a turd burger that thing was. It would suck up the mess but I could never tell if I was spraying cleaner or not. Half the time I felt like I was just spreading the mess around. Th floor one S3 was on sale for prime day so I figured I‚Äôd give Tineco one more shot and wow. Night and day. This thing sprays the cleaner all by itself, it‚Äôs self propelled, it leaves minimal moisture behind, kind of separates debris from dirty water and the floors are spot less. The self clean cycle is also pretty impressive as well. I have all sealed concrete floors and it really just does an amazing job for normal cleaning as well as pet accidents.

Great thing about it is I do t have to vacuum first, it will s incorporated into the system!  I love it!

Lacy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pain,the United States,3-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I was soooo excited to get this. I have seen it on tik tok and the reviews and videos were great.  I waited 4 months going back and forth since it was a big purchase and I broke down and got it.  I have 4 dogs in my house and 3 kids so my floors get muddy and dirty.  I vacuum first to keep most of the hair out of it and use it mostly for a mop.  I hate that I get only halfway done with one room and I have to stop for the self cleaning then have to empty and refill before finishing and the same for the next room and then by that time the battery is dead.  I also was hoping it would be able to get tar off but it doesn't.  I do feel like my floors get clean and like it better than a mop but it's time consuming after emptying and filling and waiting for the battery to charge.,

My biggest complaint is the battery life it starts out showing 90 but I can‚Äôt even do my whole living room dining room and kitchen without it going down to nearly 30. I don‚Äôt really think it helps make the house smell nice either I feel like after you mop you should be able to smell the cleaning liquid. I‚Äôm not impressed.

My wife who is a fanatic when it comes to cleaning used it for the first time today and though we have 4 other machines including the A11 I think her rating of ""Nifty"" means she's highly impressed.

But I always sweep very well before I use this wet/dry vac and I still have to disassemble, rinse all the parts (spinning brush, brush cover, and dirty water tank) before I get through one cycle of my two main living areas.

That other cleaners wer heavy, loud, hard to maneuver, and then hard to maintain (I could never get it clean). When I first received the Tineco, I was concerned that it wouldn't give me that deep clean I desired. I have come to believe this is a much better machine. It is so light-weight, so easy to maneuver and OMG so easy to maintain. In fact, it's so easy to use, now my floors are cleaner than they have ever been. All because it I use it much more often.

It‚Äôs easy to use and the Tineco cleaning solution is amazing as removing stains and odors. There are two things however that I‚Äôd like to see improve: The charging base is extremely irritating. When trying to self clean or charge it only takes a minor push or movement to make it stop charging. This means hitting the self clean button several times or gingerly pushing it to get it to run as not to knock it off charging. The second is it‚Äôs ‚Äúscrubbing‚Äù ability. While it can vac up nearby anything and give a nice clean surface, it can leave behind some more set in stains that require manual scrubbing. It would be awesome if Tineco offered a scrubbing roller so when you‚Äôre cleaning a really dirty mess you can scrub then swap and clean.",

I can‚Äôt believe how much it vacuumed up and how perfect my floor looks after the water is sucked up. There is barely any water left on the floor at all and it dries quickly. There are no streaks and no hair left behind. It has cut my cleaning time in half. I recommend this to anyone with real wood floors and even ceramic floors, what an amazing job it does!

I originally bought this for my dad,  he has vinyl floors and it works ok. I used it on my stained concrete floors and it didn't seem to perform as well.

The only thing that has ever gotten my floors this clean was hand scrubbing and then going back over with a steam mop. Its effortless to use, and the self cleaning option is great. In a home full of kids and animals this has been a lifesaver. I can do my entire main floor in 1/4 of the time i could use a traditional mop, and only refill once.

Great suction. Dog knocked over the baby plate which had eggs, cottage cheese, hash browns, fruit and bacon and I was able to clean up the mess in less than 5min. Muddy footprints up in seconds. The ‚Äúchunkier‚Äù messes have to be ran over a few times as it shoots the large chunks back out. Overall, I love it, but I‚Äôve read mixed reviews about how long it will perform well.

Maddox and Friends Cat Rescue,1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst purchase of the year for us.,the United States,6-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I bought this thinking it would be so superior to the cross wave and boy was I wrong. It just pushed larger debris all over. We use paper cat litter so the pellets get all over the hard floor. The cross wave sucks them right up. This won‚Äôt even touch it. Cereal? Nope. Larger pieces of anything? Nope. I essentially wasted hundreds of dollars on something I‚Äôll have to resell for half the price. I‚Äôm so disappointed. After reading the reviews on here I was so sure that it would be the best thing ever. It is absolutely not. And you can quite literally stare at the battery just draining as fast as can be. Very misleading reviews. I hope to save someone from making the same mistake. Go get a cross wave. They‚Äôre superior in every way.,

However, I am very skeptical with mopping machines. It just happened I watched a Tineco's video on Tiktok and it looks really tempting so I decided to give it a try.I am shocked.I am shocked by how easy it is to use, to clean, and how clean it makes my living environment to.Strongly suggesting this product although $399 ( after tax is about $430 ish? ) is definitely a bit pricy.But if you could afford it and you like to be in a clean environment, this is a life saver.",
Saundarya Ajit,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders for hardwood floors!!,the United States,8-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Living with a German shepherd and two kids my house was always a mess. Tineco saved my life during the shedding season. Picks up even the tiniest of hair and saves me a lot of time. It‚Äôs not always possible to vacuum and mop everyday. We still have a roomba running everyday and I vacuum using a dyson vacuum every other day but the feeling of clean house only comes when we see shiny floors. And the tineco gives that experience. It even picks up play dog and sand- slime!!!,

This thing has been a game changer for my life....GAME CHANGER..... I was hesitant to spend this much money on something. I don‚Äôt have any carpet and I really like to go over my floors daily vacuuming. I have one dog that sheds a little (Frenchie) and I have teenagers running in and out of my house. I can clean my entire floors in 30-40 min. I do have to stop and refill the water and clean the brush but that is so much that a mop bucket and changing the water, but it does not run out of battery life. I feel like I‚Äôm still going to have to deep mop every once in awhile but this machine has literally changed my life because. My son can use. It‚Äôs super user friendly. I do not regret my purchase at all. I have only had for about a month! Maybe I could an update in 6 months or so and see how it has lasted.",

Lauren Hickey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Time Saver for Small Living Spaces,the United States,15-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I wish I bought this product years ago! As a college student living in a loft with a dog, I love being able to pick up pet hair and get the entire floor clean in one trip around the house. I‚Äôm very pleased that the suction power has no issue against the piles of dog hair hidden in tight spaces. It leaves the floor streak free with all messes gone, and it doesn‚Äôt use a ton of water so it practically dries as you go. I‚Äôm obsessed the self cleaning feature, it‚Äôs very satisfying to see the dirt lift right out.  The overall look of the model is pleasing enough to keep the battery port/unit itself out in my living space. The only negative thing I could see using this product is the fact that it has two settings that one could say has limited usage time-wise: firstly, the eco mode (25 minute run time) and secondly, the max mode (18 minute run time). I have no issue with this as I live in a small apartment, but big houses would potentially require to recharge in order to cover the entire area.",

Our home is mostly solid hardwood floors but also has one room with LVT and 4 with tile. On one charge and a little less than two tanks of fluid this thing did all of them. More importantly, the floors are clean. We re-vacuumed the main living area with an empty catch bin to check, snd no hair remaining from our two shedding dogs. And, a wipe check with a clean white towel got nothing.The only draw back was emptying the tank. There was, as expected, a lot of dog hair.

Now I do at least 1 room a day. You truly don‚Äôt have to sweep first. The display ring is red when the floors are dirty and turns blue as the become clean. I did my mud room floor first and then wiped it with a clean paper towel, there was nothing. Very clean. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt leave a big wet mess behind, is lightweight and insanely easy to use. It literally tells you went you need to empty the dirty water bin, or fill the clean water. When you‚Äôre finished, it runs it‚Äôs own cleaning cycle and cleans itself.

Kylea Amerin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the splurge,the United States,12-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"With all hardwood floors, cleaning tends to be incredibly time-consuming and back-breaking. I really enjoy my Tineco. It's lightweight, maneuverable, and cordless. A capful of the solution and a tank of clean water, and the results in the dirty water tank speak for themselves. This is a great item for cleaning up spills, weekly tidying, and just making your life easier overall.I wouldn't recommend trying to use this item for extensive deep cleaning, but as your everyday wash and vacuum option, it's a solid choice. The charging dock can be kept out of the way and makes sure your Tineco is always ready to go. If you're considering this purchase, it's worth the splurge.",
AJ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overhyped,the United States,12-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,This thing is only good for spot cleaning. The vacuum doesn't touch the sides of the wall so expect missed spots. Continually been having issues each time of it not working. Most days it broken and doesn't suck up anything. It just leaves puddles behind no matter how you try to follow troubleshooting instructions. Some days it works other it doesn't. This is complete trash and isn't worth the money.,

We have a utility sink in the garage, so that‚Äôs where that happens. The only negative so far is that the tanks are small, so you constantly have to empty, rinse, and clean dirty water tank and fill the clean water tank. It usually takes me a minimum of three times doing this process to clean my house. Also to get around the toilet areas in the bathroom is impossible on one side because the roller is too wide.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn‚Äôt work from the start,the United States,26-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Is it possible to give negative stars? We bought this mop and took it out of the package let it charge for 24 hours to ensure the battery was fully charged. Went to use it and within 15 seconds it kept turning off showing max. Turned it off and turned it back on within 15 seconds max again. Looked at the paperwork again to see if we were doing something wrong. Nothing. Now the machine doesn‚Äôt even turn on. Literally just sitting in the other room on the charger and it‚Äôs dead. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.,
Megan Russo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with my purchase,the United States,1-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"First off. I‚Äôve had this a little over a month and every time I use it, I‚Äôm very happy.1. It does suck up Legos so make sure you don‚Äôt dump the container down the sink before removing legos2. You do not need to sweep your floors first, however I noticed that on the times I don‚Äôt sweep first, I have to charge it in the middle of my first floor wash. I also have to change the water container 4 times.  On the times I pre sweep‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have to charge it and I only had to refill the water container 2 times.  First floor is about 1500 sq feet.My favorite feature it how the light turns a red color when the area is extra dirty.I‚Äôm happy I bought this. Very simple to set up and to clean and to store.",

I have a house full of boys and a big Rottweiler who tracks in lots of mud and drool. My Boys are always spilling things and get paint, play dough, food everywhere. I haven‚Äôt came across one thing yet that it Doesn‚Äôt pick up. My only complaint is how frequently you have to clean it, to keep it from stinking and working really well but it‚Äôs a tiny inconvenience, that just comes along with the maintenance. I am a carpet person, But this vacuum works so well I wish my whole house was all hardwood!",
Courtney L. Lowe,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't clean. Just wets the floor.,the United States,26-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I didn't expect this to deep clean or scrub the floor, but I was hoping for a better replacement for a swiffer for in between actual mopping.It basically slightly wets the floor and sucks up the water. If you have little kids constantly dropping cereal, maybe it's worth it, but just for general cleaning, it's not worth the money.",One
Lena & Vasili,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why didn‚Äôt I get it earlier,the United States,6-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Very sturdy quality: I have been impressed after having numerous similar items not being even close as good quality. It‚Äôs very easy to use and clean: even my 15 yo does cleaning with pleasure. The battery is actually longer than 22 minutes as claimed but it might be because it‚Äôs brand new.The only con I can mention is that the head is too big to get under some furniture but all this is manageable.,
Roni Cox,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Floor Cleaner I have ever purchased,the United States,15-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I own just about every floor cleaner out there because I have pergo wood floors and had the hardest time keeping them clean. Not any more.  This Tineco is Amazing! It is self propelled like a lawnmower,  it gets under cabinets and even around the toilet.  It monitors and cleans itself as well. Not to mention that it isn't as loud as others.So when it arrived, I decided to try it out on my already clean floor that I had used my steam cleaner on. Well, I enclosed a picture of ALL of the hair and grime it sucked up out of what I thought was a clean floor. My floors look and feel the cleanest they have ever been and the biggest bonus is no flim and streaks that all products usually leave. Anyone with pergo floors should know what I am talking about.",

The dirty water tank fills up between rooms and I have to empty it and I need to refil and clean water tank but still on one charge and it‚Äôs great! Love the self cleaning feature too! At first I thought it would be a lot of work but it‚Äôs really not that bad and it cleans so well!!",

This machine is absolutely incredible. I‚Äôm able to clean 1000 ft.¬≤ in under 20 minutes with one tank of solution. My floors look better with this machine then anything I‚Äôve ever used before. I seriously wish I bought this sooner. Doesn‚Äôt matter how big of a mess the kids make anymore, this machine will make light work out of the chaos.

So recently that there was still water in the clean water tank. It was disgusting! No where in the description did it say anything about it being a used model, I paid FULL PRICE and it was missing the 3 in 1 cleaning tool. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. But because it was so hard to get my hands on, I cleaned it and tried it out and was very impressed with how well it cleans. I have 4 boys, a German Shepard, a Lab and a lot of wood floors and this has been a life saver!",One
AJS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,4-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Love my Tineco. Easy to use. Does a great job cleaning. I had a steam mop previously and thought it did a good job. Imagine how surprised I was that my floors were not that clean with using it. The Tineco does so much better. I like how it vacuums and cleans at the same time. Don't be surprised that you may have to dump the dirty water bin sooner than expected. It doesn't happen as quickly after the first time. That just tells me how dirty my floors were even though I was using a steam mop.,
Sheri,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good with pet hair,the United States,27-Feb-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Did not suck up pet hair. The hair would gather around the brush and the machine would randomly spit out big balls of fur. The machine puts out water automatically, so you have no control over how much water is used. I don‚Äôt feel the machine sucked well, it left my floors very wet. Due to this my floors ended up streaked. I do not feel this machine is worth the high price.",One
Sumra,4.0 out of 5 stars,Tanks are on the smaller side,the United States,2-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,So far I like it. It has gotten some stuck in stuff but has a hard time with others but I just scrap that off the floor and suck it up with it (mainly gummies from my toddler that she‚Äôs stepped on üôÑ) my floors definitely look better then they would with my spray mop! The floor drys pretty fast afterwards as well. 4 stars because I wish the tanks were larger but I can live with it for how good my floors look ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,

A. Henderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gamechanger!,the United States,24-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Holy hell - I had no idea I hated doing floors as much as I did until I bought this thing.  My whole house is hard wood floor and tile, so I've got 1300+ soft of mopping to do on the regular.  The hassle of making a bucket of solution, putting the mop together and then actually doing the cleaning.  This thing you charge up, fill up the clean water tank with a little bit of cleaner and go to town! When the roller gets too nasty, it tells you and you let it clean itself, and right back to cleaning floors.  I did the biggest, nastiest spaces in my house on a half of a charge, and it's amazing how much grime it picked up in just the first pass over the floor.  Highly recommend!",
Caroline ,5.0 out of 5 stars,1000% Worth It. Buy it!,the United States,24-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Be weary of resellers!! Wait until in stock at $399.99!!!! I was a little weary with the price but let me tell you it‚Äôs worth every. single. penny. I attached a picture my floors where I cleaned and where I didn‚Äôt. This was ONE pass. It has no issue with dog hair and has great suction to dry water quickly. It is great for deep cleaning, my floors FEEL clean! My back doesn‚Äôt hurt from trying to mop. The self cleaning feature is nice, but it does have a few parts that need to be manually cleaned and dried every so often, but WELL worth it considering the trade off of mopping... the cleaning solution is not that expensive and you use such a small amount, the bottle should last for at least 50 tanks.",

It does great with the dog hair also, I will say though if my dogs are shedding a lot I vacuum first so I don‚Äôt have to stop and clean out the ifloor so much.

The solution smells great and seems to work well.  The only thing I dislike is that it takes a while to clean the hair and gunk that the machine gets off your floor because it gets mixed with the dirty water.  I need to clean the machine after cleaning the floor.  Also, if I don‚Äôt clean the roller on a hot day, it can stay damp too long and start to smell bad.

It was a production!  A REAL pain!  With this little jewel from Tineco it's vac it up, mop it up  and I'm done.  I can put my towels away and retire the Pine Sol and mop.

I not only don't mind cleaning my floors now (I hardly ever did before because of a bad back), I enjoy it! It is a de-stressor! It is absolutely worth the money.

It is however pretty cumbersome. Everytime you use it you must empty the dirty water tank (expected), clean it & the roller out & dry, refill the clean water tank with cleaning solution, use the ‚Äúself clean‚Äù option, and then after it done... take it all apart again, clean, and refill the clean water tank to start cleaning the floor again. It‚Äôs a lot to do when the majority of your house is hard floors. I bought this to clean my floors better AND to save time. So far, it‚Äôs not saving me time but it is cleaning the floors better.",

My favorite feature is the self clean mode, and you do not have to buy new pads, rollers.  Money saver. I did give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn‚Äôt get the inch or two near the walls when mopping and I wish the tanks were larger.

I have a 3,000sq ft home fully tiled I had to recharged three times. Also, it is a surface cleaner, you can't go under  a table, bed or any furniture it will shut off.

Justin L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,the United States,3-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"LOVE this product! It has been a game changer in my house. We have 3 boys and a large dog, it quickly and easily takes care of everyday messes. Huge time saver that I don't have to vacuum before I mop. I bought a second set of roller bars so I can let them dry out in between uses, and still have a clean dry set ready to go when the next mess happens. Since seeing how well mine works, my mother-in-law, sister in law's, and best friends have all bought one. Only downside is it leaves about a 1 inch gap by the baseboards that doesn't get mopped. It still sucks up the crumbs and dirt, just can't reach it with the mop. Which to me is minor, I just take my old swifter to the edges. I use the eco mode on my wood floors and use the higher speed on my tile. It's super easy to use, my 5&7 year olds use it and change the filter and roller bars themselves.  Definitely worth the money!!",
Sammy Ibrahim,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great concept with some flaws,the United States,18-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I really wish the tanks were bigger (clean and dirty) and a mode to just vacuum with no water or mop.

Frankie K,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not a bad little machine,the United States,8-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,So far so good. I did have some problems with air in the lines when I first starting using the machine. After some google searching I found out how to fix it.Love how it can clean itself but it seems to want to do a self cleaning after very little of actual floor cleaning.  Also the tray never gets clean when it‚Äôs running the self clean cycle so the dirty water just pools some.Overall it cleans the floors very well and I have totally replaced my everyday mopping.,
Literature,5.0 out of 5 stars,Small but efficient,the United States,4-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,This vacuum is exactly what I wanted for my hardwoods and tile. It does a thorough job and notifies me when the roller needs to be cleaned. This is easily and automatically done wo removing the roller. Then one continues cleaning. The only downside is the batteries last about 1/2 hr. at which time it is set in the base for recharging. If that is enough time for your home then I highly recommend it.,

This thing does a fairly good job of helping me keep up with the mess. The suction power is fantastic, the mopping is fair. I do have to refill the water about 3-4 times to cover the whole house, but I supposed a mop and bucket is similar. Overall I much prefer this over vacuuming AND mopping separately",
jasmine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have a pet or a child, you need this.",the United States,2-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I love my Tineco! It has saved me so much time cleaning up messes from kids and dogs! It‚Äôs great for spot treating big spills and on MAX mode sucks up the stuff in my grout! However, my complaint is that although it cleans well it doesn‚Äôt get the edges or corners of the room nor hard stuck on things like candy. It also does leak a small amount of dirty water onto the ground sometimes. I do however appreciate that it is relatively easy to take apart and clean. I think everyone should have one but I do think improvements could be made on the product.I should also note we have a long haired GSD that sheds horribly. If you have a dog that sheds in large amounts you will need to take the roller off and scoop out a bit of hair at times. It‚Äôs very simple to do and doesn‚Äôt bother me much. The self cleaning works well but often there is hair stuck behind the roller. Either way get it! My floors have never felt cleaner.",

It‚Äôs really easy to take apart and clean the parts. I am beyond impressed.

It is not very good for stuck on foods, I have to bend down and scrape it off but then it picks it right up! Great for hair, dirt, and the self cleaning option does a great job of cleaning! I do with the tanks were a little easier to place back in but once I learned the trick to it, its fine! I would buy again!! Worth the money!",

Well this item was delivered to another house and thankfully 3 days later someone brought it over to me!!  The vacc mop is BYFAR the best thing Iv ever boughten!! It was recommended from a close friend so of course I HAD to try it right?! So glad I did. I have 3 large dogs, to kids and a fianc√© who ALL come back in the house either muddy, dirty or covered in something ! This thing has saved my life!  No more mopping & sweeping. It does it all for me !!  If your on the fence just do it!! The auto clean mode, auto suction and all the other features this bad girl has is amazing!",
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THIS!!,the United States,28-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This is amazing! Lightweight and so easy to push...actually, no need to push because it practically drives itself! I couldn't believe how dirty the water was after first use...my floor was cleaned with mop/bucket & Mr. Clean just 2 days before. Even without using the cleaner, the floors smell fresh. Use it on my linoleum and laminate floors.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daddy AF,the United States,1-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"The most impressive thing about this was that I tested the highest traffic area of my house (by the back door, doggie door and dog water/food bowls) with a single pass followed up by scrubbing a few tiles with a damp paper towel to find nearly nothing on the paper towel.It is so fast and easy to use and I don‚Äôt care what kind of mess my kid or dogs make on the floor because I know it will be a quick clean up.I refer to this as my baby and my son may feel slightly offended but some day he will understand",One
KVel0910,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have!,the United States,27-Dec-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Got this as a house warming gift and it has changed my life! My floors are so much cleaner with 2 kids and 3 dogs. I vacuumed then used this because I was scared about the amount of dog hair and it still picked up a ton of dog hair. My kid smeared an Oreo all over the hardwood floor and this cleaned it right up. I had to go over it like 3-4 times but it was clean. Only negative thing I have to say is that I can‚Äôt get into small spaces with this. You will probably have to eventually mop with a regular mop and bucket to get the hard to reach places but this product is 100% worth every penny. If it breaks I will 100% but another one for the ease it makes keeping my house clean.,
Paul J. Wegman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Still need to scrub in your hands and knees,the United States,17-Feb-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I loved how light it was and the helpful notifications  about cleaning. It pulls itself across the floor!It does NOT clean even the smallest dried juice drops or other little sticky substances. I had to stop scrap with my fingernail if a rag, and keep cleaning. I have 3 grandchildren staying with me so it felt like a total waste. I wanted this to make life easier.Maybe for a house that‚Äôs generally spotless otherwise don‚Äôt waste your money.",
Ashley S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the purchase,the United States,6-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This has changed my life in terms of cleaning. I hate washing the floors, so it was absolutely worth the purchase. The only things negative to note: The suction is pretty good, but it tends to blow things around. It does not get to the edge of my floor. It leaves about an inch. Lastly, the dirty and clean water tanks are small so I have to change them frequently within the same session.",
Shay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like, not love",the United States,6-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I researched for about 2 months before deciding to drink the Kool-Aid & purchase this. Floors look great, they also dry impressively fast, & the solution smells awesome. BUT after all is said & done, the self cleaning has a few drawbacks. You still have to take everything apart bc dog hair (I have 2), dirt, & sand still get stuck inside and all over the base it goes on. This is all after you‚Äôve taken it apart to clean it in order to prep it for the self clean. Last thing & this may be reaching but I wish it had the ability to heat the water/ have a steam option. I feel like it‚Äôd have a better deep clean feel.",
Laura,2.0 out of 5 stars,I loved it until it stopped working.....6 months later.,the United States,11-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,It honestly was what I thought would be the best purchase ever. It feels nice and study and it cleaned very well. However 6 months later the vacuum stopped working. I'm currently working with Tineco to see what solution they have to the problem but from the looks of it its going to be a long process. Looking back at other reviews now I see that this is a common problem. So probably not the best way to spend your money.,

We have dogs and lots of pine trees so mopping at least weekly is a necessity. This turns my weekly sweeping then mopping my main floor into a twenty minute thing instead of an hour. It sometimes leaves things, like tree sap, but that's difficult even by hand. It's easier to spot on a clean floor after using this machine. We really appreciate it.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best wet vac ever,the United States,24-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I love this wet vac. Instead of vacuuming the floor then mopping it, you are able to do it all at once. Plus you are not just pushing dirty water around you are sucking it up leaving a clean bear foot happy floor. Cleaning fluid comes with it and does a great job. It does most of our 3200 sf home on a charge. Cleans up area rugs as well. I empty the dirty water every time I need to refill the water with cleaner then I flush the dirty water down the toilet. I do clean the vacuum completely when I am completely done with vacuuming. It is easy to maneuver and not at all heavy to push. I absolutely love this vacuum!!!!!",
Mariah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth it,the United States,14-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,This cleans really well. I mop my floor with a freshly cleaned mop head. And then I ran the time I. The picture is of just what came off the area by my hallway.  It did take a few passes on some of the stains in the kitchen but everything did come off. It will not get about a inch from any wall. And you will have to charge about every 35 minutes.,One
Sierra Eden,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE IT,the United States,7-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I love this vacuum/mop. I have two cats and a bloodhound and the animal hair is real. Our entire house is hardwood, so it's almost impossible to keep the floors clean. Our home is about 1500 square feet and I can do an entire floor on one charge, probably part of both floors but I haven't tried yet. I do wish the tanks were bigger, but it's super quick and easy to empty/fill them, so that's not a big pain. If you have major spills right against the edge of the floor, you might have to spot clean by hand but otherwise it's perfect. I highly recommend this.",

I have never loved any cleaning appliance the way I love this sweet sweet machine. Using it is almost effortless, and the self cleaning feature makes clean up almost the same. Just empty the tanks, and all the debris after it‚Äôs finished self-cleaning and you‚Äôre good to go. I‚Äôve added a video of it cleaning up the breakfast crumbs my boys left behind with EASE.

Jessica,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed.,the United States,16-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Heard amazing things about this thing. But in short.. it‚Äôs a lazy mans way of doing a terrible mop job.

It doesn‚Äôt clean corners or edges, and leaves streakes. I‚Äôm so disappointed.",
Andrea Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!!,the United States,29-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I have had this about about a week, and I was in love immediately. I have been looking for a quicker way to keep our vinyl plank floors clean as we are a busy family of 7 living on a farm. This has been the ticket. It is very easy to use. I feel it cleans well. It is easy maintenance. I love the self cleaning feature. I use it 2-3 times a day. When I first started using it my water was very dirty. Now when I use it the water is about half as dirty. Kids walk in with muddy boots I just run this and all clean in 30 seconds. I run it around the table and kitchen after meals. If there is a lot of big debris I will sweep, otherwise this amazing machine seems able to handle the rest.",

The cleanup afterwards is really just a quick rinse of the filter and dirty water tank, after the brush roller self cleans, it‚Äôs easily popped out to dry in the drying rack.

If it's a straight surface, you are fine. But if it has to ""skip"" over to another tile just a little bit, the water will skip over too and the roller. So that's a little aggravating.",

I love that it mops at the same time as vacuuming, but the thing just isn't what its advertised to be. in videos it picks up cereal and syrup and has no problem getting up pet hair. I used it in one moderately sized room and had to empty or declog the machine three times. I don't think it's meant to keep up with two dogs and four kids which is very disappointing considering the price I paid for it and the skyrocketing of price that keeps happening. Frankly I'm just disappointed.",

After a few short months of using it, I‚Äôve noticed that it leaves a lot of dirt/dust behind. Also, Not even a full minute into cleaning my floors, it will inform me to set it on the charger and to run the self cleaning cycle even after Ive taken it apart and cleaned it by hand as well as replacing the filter & roller. I also never put any other solution into it besides the Tineco solution so I have no idea what could be going on with it. For what I paid for this, I expected a much better product and I truly regret purchasing it. I will just stick the good old fashioned mop and bucket!",

She came across this product and figured she would give it a try, she loves it and I have tried it and also love it! It is lightweight, the dual purpose of vacuum and mopping without steam is awesome. Her floors have never looked so good and the ease of use no longer makes the task so overwhelming when keeping up with the dogs. I love that the dirt is collected in the water and you just need to dispose of the water and the mop is self cleaning when in the base. Awesome product! We will be purchasing another for me :)",

I don't necessarily need to sweep before i mop, i will occasionally if there are big pieces on the ground that i don't want to clog and mess this tineco up. When i would use the steam mop the pads would get so nasty, even washing them to reuse they got dirty so quickly and i would have to wait until i wash/dry the pad to reuse it. The tineco in the other hand I can clean majority of the rooms and still keep going it's that easy, I just have to clean the water tank, and sometimes the debris part but its good to go after a couple self cleaning modes and cleaning the water tank still takes way much lesser time to do.",

Mikaela,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for deep cleaning or price.,the United States,5-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Not worth the money. If you‚Äôre one of those OCD cleaners like myself that has to make sure to get every crease and spot in the house this is not it. Not worth the money.

The fact that this machine can handle cleaning wet and dry messes at the same time = A+ Product.I will say, the dirty water reservoir does fill up pretty quickly & when it does, the machine stops. My floors were dirtier than I expected, I stopped 3 times during my cleaning to empty out the dirty water reservoir. Other than that, my floors feel AMAZING! Way better than I thought they would. Blew my expectations out of the water. The self cleaning is a huge plus, I thought I got the thing clean but after running the self cleaning mode there was more gunk that was pushed through.

It‚Äôs extremely user friendly. I love that it has a self cleaning mode too! The cleaner that it comes with has a very subtle yet pleasant ‚Äúclean‚Äù smell. I am very sensitive to perfume type scents, but this is very nice.  I‚Äôm horrified to think that I have just been pushing around dirt with other mop systems over the years!

Used my Tineco for the first time yesterday and all I can say is WOW!  The unit is super easy to use and it cleans great. I was sweeping my floor at least 5 times a day before and this morning my floors look great and clean. It was so fast to use and getting everything done in one step saves time. So happy I gave this a try.,
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty handy.,the United States,3-Oct-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Super awesome for daily mess. Not for things like day old chocolate cake dried onto floor. Brush is very flat...if anything is stuck its just like using a regular vacuum on hard floor. Must, must keep it clean and let it dry between uses otherwise smells like dirty dish rag.Very nice invention for busy people who don't pull the  mop bucket out enough! Tineco needs to invest in a fatter/stiffer cleaning roller tho.",

Norma C,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money!,the United States,12-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Absolutely love this thing! I am currently 6 months pregnant and cleaning my hardwood tile floors is so hard on my back. This vacuum/wash is so lightweight and easy to move around. It does a good job on getting most stains off the floor. You might just need to go over some of the bigger ones a few times. Cons: the battery. It might last you 20 minutes on a full battery, which is fine if your place is small. My living room alone takes me at least five minutes to clean with this thing. Also, it‚Äôs not so great for small areas or close to furniture so you might just have to slightly move it to get to it. That‚Äôs really the only negative thing I would have to say about this machine. Other than that, it‚Äôs totally worth the money!! I really don‚Äôt pick up my broom, mop or vacuum anymore.",
LetDel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,24-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to like this, but overall it was a waste of money. It works ok, but is such a hassle to clean and dry after using that it negates the benefit over just mopping separately. You have to completely disassemble the product after each use which is such a pain. If you want it to get up sticky messes you have to go over and over and over again on the same area. Not worth the money at all.",
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,19-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"First, I loved this product when I seen the results of my floor without having to break my back.The downfalls: doesn‚Äôt take long before I have to clean the dirty water tank, no big deal I found a way around that.Approximately 25 minutes to use, kinda sucks, but I can get my house done in that time too.The ultimate reason for my rating: I got 2 full uses max and my Tineco does not work! Will not charge! Doesn‚Äôt self-clean and let me tell you I made sure I read the directions and followed through with everything correctly before I even used it. I‚Äôm discouraged cause the money spent feels like a total loss when I could have used it elsewhere.",
DY,2.0 out of 5 stars,Fails too often,the United States,6-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Nice design, nice price but it just fails too often in real world situations and usage.  Suction power is decent and it does a pretty good job sucking up the water so that it leaves your floor relatively dry.  But the downsides out weigh these positives.  Downsides being:-  can't really handle moping up any normal amounts of food.  It'll clog it up asap-  even when I ""pre-clean"" the floor so there's no solid waste on the floor, the unit will still stop and display the ""Channel has blockage"" error message.Hope their customer service can do something about this.  I'm still under their 2 year warranty.",

This part is inaccessible and I can't return the vaccum as Amazon has 30 day policy.  The warranty from the manufacturer is just 90 days.

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,We have white floors and 5 dogs,the United States,24-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"We are a family of 6 and 5 little dogs so our new white floors get dirty fast.  At first, we weren't too sure of this vacuum.  Even after reading all the reviews and seeing testimonies on social media.  We just installed white tile. I got it out of the box and attempted using the Tineco.  After using it, the floor still looked dirty.  My husband thinks it was still residue from the grout even though we had used a Swifter numerous times since installing the floor this summer.  So we ended up hand washing the floor.  After handwashing, I usually use the Tineco Ifloor3 at least every day or every other day and it seems to take up the day to day dirt pretty easily.  I still think we will need to hand wash our floors at least once a month, but this will be used for day to day dirt.

Remove the cardboard from the rotary brush before use! That being said let me talk about all of the fantastic features this floor cleaner has. Yes, $400 is pricey. That is more than I spent on my carpet vacuum, but this comes with a pretty big bottle of cleaner. You only need a cap full. It comes with an installed HEPA filter and an extra. It also come with an installed brush and an extra. It also comes with a cleaning wand that has a couple uses. And, it talks to you! I really like that it doesn't soak my floors as it cleans. It doesn't spray out water. You don't even have to push or hold down a button to operate it. It just keeps the rotary brush damp and sucks up the dirty water as you push it along the floor. The whole thing is really pretty light, much lighter than my carpet vacuum. The first charge lasted long enough to clean my 10x10 kitchen floor and my master bathroom with battery to spare.",

I was lured in by several TikTok videos of people using their Tineco so naturally I was skeptical. After stalking Amazon and BestBuy waiting for one to be available... I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. It basically pulls you forward so all you really have to do is steer. Suction is better than on my Dyson vacuum. Cleanup was a tiny bit confusing at first - but now I think it is the best small appliance I have ever owned. Also, I can‚Äôt believe my floors were actually that dirty! üò≥üòÜ",

I‚Äôve cleaned it after every use and even cleaned the inside and replaced the roller brush and filter. I cannot get the smell to go away and I‚Äôm sad I only had it for 60 days before I had issues.

My floors haven‚Äôt been this clean in a long time. My only complaint is the battery life. You only get around 30min. Also the clean water tank and the dirty water tank could be a little bigger. I love the self cleaning mode. Works wonders! With the battery life this is perfect for smaller jobs.,

The smell of the cleaner is amazing.The only thing I wish is that it could go longer without needing to run a self cleaning cycle.  I clean the Family room, front room, kitchen and hallway regularly and I can only get halfway through before having to run self cleaning cycle.  I feel I need to order more filters since the instructions say that you are supposed to use a dry clean filter when using the vacuum.",

Elaura Scharett,5.0 out of 5 stars,cleans deep but here is what i wish i knew,the United States,9-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I'm still giving this a 5 star because it does get up a lot of dirt and doesn't leave the floor sopping wet unfortunately because I did want to watch my family bust their a**. What I wish I knew was if you have pretty messy floors (not like hoarders but more like rugrats) it can get backed up fast and require a cleaning. I do love how well this machine it seems like it gets a lot of dirt up but at the same time there are some things it just struggles with like picking up cereal but i expect to much in life apparently and getting crusty applesauce off hardwood that my 1 year old thought would be a hilarious challenge for me indeed he was correct it was pretty funny watching mom get on all 4's to scrub the floor after using her new $300 fancy vacmop.,

Deep cleans my wood and tile floors with no streaking and almost completely dry. I love the feature that lets me know to continue passes over dirtier areas of the floor until they are completely clean. The self-propelled feature makes it incredibly maneuverable. One charge is enough to finish my downstairs floors unless they are crazy dirty. Beats every other floor cleaner I‚Äôve ever tried, hands down!!",

Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Frequent Cleaning,the United States,12-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This is a godsend! I'm a loyal Tineco vaccum and Brevill Steam mop user.  This, however, is making those obsolete.  Does it do as good of a job as the steam mop?  No, but it's pretty close.  And, it's all one step.  And, it's cordless.  And it's less clean up.  So, it takes me 15 min max to do my whole house.  Even doing it once a week, that keeps my floors perfectly clean.  It's fun though, so I'll probably do it twice a week, so they stay clean.  I also love that I can use it on Pergo - before I would just vacuum and spot clean.  If you like a clean house and you don't mind cleaning regularly, this is a must have!",

Only a couple things I didn't like. 1, the water compartments are small, so if you have a bigger floor, you will have to clean and refill more often, ...which is no big deal, a minor inconvenience..2) it obviously doesn't clean all the way to the edge of your floor..close to the baseboard..which every now n then you'll have to use a regular mop or take a rag and wipe. Other than that, always clean all parts when you're done. Do not leave water especially the dirty water sit, it will make the unit and microfiber roller smell!",

Moved into new house with a lot of hardwood floors and makes cleaning easy.  fyi some people have said they use this product on carpets, that's not what it's for.

I wanted to love it really badly. All of these great reviews had me fooled but consider all of the bad reviews before your purchase please. I had been saving for this vacuum for months with the promise that it would thoroughly and efficiently clean my floors. Well the suction was not strong at all when it was working, and now after only a few months of having it, it broke so it leaks dirty water all over my floors. My whole house smelled like mildew for days after I used it. Really unfortunate considering the price. Not worth it IMO and a much cheaper vacuum could do a much better job. Really disappointed.",

Let dirty water container soak in bleach overnight and left spinner in bowl of mr clean cleaner and that got the god awful smell out.

Heather,5.0 out of 5 stars,Time saver!!!!,the United States,13-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This saves so much time when cleaning!!!!! I don't regret buying this at all. I do think it needs some upgrades though. It needs a more powerful suction. You can't get right up against baseboards, it should have a stronger suction so you can ensure it picks up everything. There should also be a way to use it without ""mopping"" and it needs an attachment.",

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute nightmare,the United States,5-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"First of all, the worst app ever! It is an absolute nightmare to register it through the app. Took 5 tries to get it to work. Second, you can only use it on non-carpet floors! Only hardwood floors, tile, etc. There‚Äôs no regular vacuum feature for carpet areas. There‚Äôs no tools to use for hard to reach areas. You have to clean the brushes after EVERY single use. If you‚Äôre trying to do a quick floor clean and be done, it will affect its useful life to not clean the brushes. Kinda defeats the purpose of easy quick floor cleaning.

As someone who is physically disabled its always been hard to maintain clean floors. Having a baby and 2 dogs I was vacuuming everyday and having to go over with a mop and this vacuum does it all in one go. It was super easy to set up. My son also has Sensory issues and the regular vacuuming would put him in overload with the loudness and this vacuum is so quiet that it doesn't bother my son a bit.

You‚Äôd never know it though because the tineco cleans everything up in a jiffy. I‚Äôm floored by how well this machine cleans.,

There is a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to maintaining/cleaning the machine properly, but once you‚Äôve done it a couple of times it becomes much easier than the hassle of vacuuming and then using a traditional mop.Strongly suggest either using the included cleaner or finding a floor cleanser that does not create excess foam when agitated. If you use a foamy cleanser it will fill up the dirty water tank very quickly.Overall the purchase was totally worth it and my floors have that soft glow after each use!",2

I passed it along to a relative that wanted it rather than throwing it in the trash and ordered the Tineco S3. Tik Tok definitely convinced me of the purchase, and they were highly accurate. I have used many times now and am impressed more and more each time. The ONLY thing I wish was that it got a little bit closer to the walls, it is not the end of the world. As it leaves a small gap, once a week I just get my spin mop and clean the edges of the floors. All in all, I have recommended this to many of my friends, family, and coworkers.

The video is what came up from my kitchen, living room rug, and hallway carpet. It doesn‚Äôt say to use it on carpet but we did and it worked great. We have a potty training 2 year old so accidents + carpet = not good results. My floors literally FEEL different to walk on. My son is scared of the vacuum sound and he is unbothered by this because it‚Äôs so much quieter. 10/10 recommend.",
Amber ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,the United States,1-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Well, this is the first time I have purchased a mop/vacuum. I did a lot of research read some reviews and then when this one was on sale bought It. Let me say IT IS AMAZING. I have a 15 year old dog who pees everywhere in her old age, so I‚Äôm always wiping up her pee. This mop is a life/back saver! I‚Äôm so thankful I found It!!!!! Also, It self propels and self cleans(though I‚Äôm still figuring out that setting).",
MLT,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recommend to all my friends,the United States,25-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I have had this product for four months now and absolutely love it. My whole home is hard flooring and mopping before was terrible. I have to change it a couple times to do everything but honestly I am so happy with my product. I have referred multiple people to tineco.,
helloterran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works magic on greasy tile and stained hardwood,the United States,5-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Very impressive vacuum/mop combo. Sucks the dirty water back in to the DWT so it will not leave a wet trail behind (which can get messy in no time).The only complaint is its self-cleaning function only cleans the mop roller. I with there's a self-clean function for the filter and covers as well. But I might be expecting to much for a small home appliance.,
Valentina Alvarez,5.0 out of 5 stars,HOLY CRAP!,the United States,2-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,My fianc√© bought me this vacuum as an early wedding present because he knows I‚Äôve been wanting one for a while and we have two dogs who are always messy and muddy running in and out of the house. HOLY CRAP THIS LITTLE THING IS AMAZING! We have hardwood floors throughout our house and I have never seen the floors so clean and this vacuum makes it sooooo easy! I mop the floors every day and even then the amount of dirt the Tineco picked up was amazing! 10/10 recommended!! Will never go back fo just mopping my floors!,
Jasmine Perryman,5.0 out of 5 stars,My floors have never been this clean...,the United States,13-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,There is absolutely nothing I dislike about this product.

Simple, powerful and efficient. But it, you won‚Äôt regret it.My only nit-pick about it, is design.

We just finished building our house and moved in before the new year and we had a hard time getting the dirt and grime off of our floors.  We vacuumed and mopped using multiple products and the floors would never get clean.  It was not until we ordered this and used it that our floors are literally squeaky clean!

My god I never realized how dirty my floors were until I had this!!! It cleans so well, easy to use and I love that it self cleans. I would recommend though for those who have pets, to just use your regular vacuum before using this. The pet hair can cause a bit of a mess when cleaning out the machine and can also clog it in certain spots. My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt get close enough to the wall as I would like, which I knew before purchasing.10 out of 10 would recommend this to anyone with hard floors. Lol shoot I already have my boss and my mom wanting to buy them too!!",
Aqeel Amir,3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs decent but over hyped.,the United States,12-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Definitely not what everyone is saying. I was nearly able to one room (13x16) as run time is about 15 minutes.  Recharge takes take 3 to 4 hours for a full battery. Imagine doing full house clean up. It will take two days at least. Also, dried up messes aren‚Äôt cleaned out either. Sure, all looks fine when little damp and shiny. When floors are dried up messes are still somewhat visible. So don‚Äôt expect deep cleaning like advertising says. Best to use streamer for such messes.",

This is the perfect solution for daily/weekly cleaning.  The mop head cleans my tile and removes the dirty water.  Light weight and the self cleaning mode is very convenient.  I have bought many cleaners and this is the best.,
Speedfast,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works surprisingly well,the United States,25-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,My only complaint is that the clean and dirty water tanks are a bit on the small side. The battery should be smaller and the reservoirs larger. In a single charge you have to empty and fill maybe 8 times? Overall I like it and would buy it again.,

Paige Glass,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE BEST,the United States,1-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"So I had been debating on one of these since around Christmas. I had a bissell crosswave pet pro but I just wasn‚Äôt really a fan of it. I sold it the day after I got the tineco because it is AMAZING. My floors actually feel cleaner after using it. The suction power is great, the machine almost pulls itself while using it. The cordless & self cleaning is a total game changer. And it‚Äôs so easy to clean out afterwards. The only negative thing I would say is that it doesn‚Äôt have the full side reach, it leaves at least a half an inch gap but that‚Äôs really not a big deal. If you‚Äôre debating, GET IT",

The I used my Tineco iFloor3I could not believe how much dirt this all-in-one floor vac and mop picked up. I was skeptical at first that this was just some type of gimmick.

I never right a review but if I could I would give 10 stars. I have 3 kids ages from 7 to 2 years old and a dog. My floors were never ever clean. Always had spills of drinks milk and ice cream and dog makes a big mess also.I used mops and a steam mop still my floors were dirty. First time when I used Tineco omg I could not believe how dirty my floors were the dirty water was disgusting. I‚Äôm in love with this I use it all the time now my cleaning got easier and I actually enjoy cleaning and seeing the Squeaky clean floors. I am amazed and would recommend everyone that has kids to get this.,
Zachary R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pass,the United States,11-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I purchased the ifloor3 in March. I had seen Good things about it. A couple of weeks ago it started shutting off as soon as I turned it on. I would put it on the dock to clean it but it would shut off before going through the full clean. I have taken everything off and cleaned all the parts thoroughly and triple checked that there wasn‚Äôt a hair clog (I have a dog) anywhere. Still no luck. I have called and emailed the manufacture and have not got a response of any kind. Save your self the trouble and just go with the bissell crosswave.,
Adrienne Butcher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bang for buck,the United States,28-Aug-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I'm really excited about this new toy.  I hate mopping and I also hate dirty floors.  I have two kids, a cat, and a dog.  And a Dyson, which is sort of great, except I still need to mop.  Not anymore.I was skeptical about this wet vac but am talking it up to all my friends now.  It's easy and perfect for keeping the kitchen and high traffic areas clean.  I love the feeling that dirt from my floors is depositing in the dirty water tank than spread around by a mop.  My floors look and feel great, and I can walk barefoot again.  It even picks up pet fur.The one drawback is its battery life.  I wish it was longer because the first few times I ran it for a deep clean, I tried to get a big area but needed to recharge the unit.  Now that I'm doing more maintenance cleaning, it's fine.",

Jessica Pena,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,14-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Can‚Äôt rave enough about this machine. I was very skeptical about the machine and brand which I‚Äôve never heard of. Machine cleans floors leaving NO streaks! Went back with a wet paper towel and a dry one and there was absolutely nothing. The only thing is that it doesn‚Äôt get the corners but I get that when I‚Äôm cleaning my baseboards. Maneuvers very easily and picks up dog hair and misc trash even cleans the door mats. Very satisfied with my purchase. 30 day review used 2X week tile and wood floor.,

So easy to charge, self clean and use. My girls actually ENJOY getting the mopping chore because they know it‚Äôs the easiest chore.I generally do vacuum with my Dyson for the two upper floors with carpet, but the Tinco lives on the main floor and is great on my low profile area rugs and the hardwood/tile.

August Wolfe,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not that great,the United States,21-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I raved about this product at first- thought it was the best thing we have purchased in a long time. 3 months of using it and it‚Äôs ‚Äúokay‚Äù.. it only lasts about 5 full minutes before the auto clean button flashes, then you have to put it back on the charger where it uses almost all over your water and solution.. then you have to fill it back up again and it only runs another 10 or so minutes before the DWT is full or the battery dies. It cleans well... but it very inconvenient how often you have to fill the water tank, auto clean and then empty the tank. For the money $$, I don‚Äôt think it is it worth it.",

You can actually feel it. have a dog that sheds and it picks her fur up wonderfully. It takes much less time to clean my floors. The Tineco ifloor 3 is worth every penny!,

Debbie,1.0 out of 5 stars,So NOT worth the money,the United States,7-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,The is not it‚Äôs all cracked up to be. If you have pets you will need pre vacuum your floors prior to using this vacuum. Also depends on home size the water reserve is not very big so you are constantly having to fill the holding tank. Very upsetting for the price.,

This latest one stopped working and smelled like an electrical fire within three uses.  Buyer beware.  If it actual worked, it could be a great product.",

It feels and smells soo clean! It left NO water on the floor. I wore socks and walked behind it the whole time and my socks were not even damp. It's pretty quiet and pulls itself forward so you're not pushing at all. And then it cleans itself!The only negative I can say is that I did have to stop and empty dirty water/ refill clean water several times. No biggie, it tells you when each is empty/full.",

Ella C.M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it!,the United States,27-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I love this machine! Having clean floors becomes a priority when you have small children. It picked up dirt that regular mopping had missed. It‚Äôs only flaw is that it does not have edge cleaning I .e. Stuff will still linger by the baseboards. However this is so trivial to me,
Mya Boyd,3.0 out of 5 stars,Tile,the United States,13-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I love the product but if your looking for a deep clean this is not it. It gets regular dirt and new spills and messes but it has a hard time getting dried food and things stuck to the floors. Also if you have tile it doesn‚Äôt really clean the grout at all it is able to suction the dirt but the water doesn‚Äôt really get in to the grout and the brush does not even touch the grout I do think the problem stems from the fact the the cleaning brush carpet texture is not very long and does not get a lot of wiggle room to get the deeper groves of the tile.,
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy,the United States,26-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,This is an amazing mop vacuum.  It is great for those everyday spills.

I love that it has a self cleaning function, but don‚Äôt be mistaken, it still does required you to take a few of the pieces apart and rinse them. The self cleaning basically does most of the job for you but also cleans the internal parts where debris and dirty water could get trapped.

It doesn‚Äôt use much water or solution and the water after was almost black. My cleaning lady steams every two weeks but that only sterilizes and pushes around dirt. This vacuum mop picks up the grease and dirt. If Dyson were to make a product like this, this would be it. Cordless and great suction. It‚Äôs not designed to rush through the big jobs although I will say if it‚Äôs a small spill, you would have it cleaned up quickly. All in all it meets more than my expectations.",
Patrice,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight easily maneuvered,the United States,30-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,This Tineco works excellent. It is light weight and very easy to maneuver. It propels quickly and it is easy to clean. The fact that it comes with and extra roller and hepa filter is a big plus. The only thing I am concerned with is that it is difficult to purchase the Tineco deodorizing and cleaning solution. It has been sold out for awhile now.,

That being said, I hate the thought of having to get down there and do the job so I bought the tinco ifloor 3.  I wasn't sure it did a great job so I did a test.  I did the whole floor, emptied the dirty water, and re-washed the floor.  Unfortunately, the wastewater was still dirty, although not as dirty as the first round.  I used to have the hoover floormate until they screwed up how they manufactured it and let me tell ya, you could eat off the floor after I was done cleaning with it. I'm disappointed.",

At $400 price tag you can expect a very satisfied end result. My floors have never been this clean.. However.. it cant fully get to the edges near the wall, but its not a deal breaker.

I like it, however if you have a big mess or big area to clean, a few things happen, either the ‚Äúclean brush‚Äù sensor comes or you need to dump the dirty water out and refill the canister.  It‚Äôs a little time consuming but I think the most annoying part is that it does not do well on corners or edges. You miss a streak of dirt because the brush does not have the capability to get into those tight areas.

Kayla Segura,2.0 out of 5 stars,It is okay does the job but not worth 300!,the United States,5-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,The dirty water tank keeps saying it is full when it isn't. It doesn't pickup well like advertised. This is good for a small house but you wouldn't be able to get through a room without having the self clean light go on since I do very little of the room and it says it needs to be cleaned so if you have a bigger house definetly do not go with it. I dont think it was worth the 300 something I paid for it.,

It cleans well, takes little time or effort to clean 1000 sq feet. Works well on hardwoods and area rugs. Self Cleaning also takes care of of that mess as well. I purchased this over the Bissell as Tineco seemed to be a company more directed towards more advanced engineering and software --- and the software automation of the Tineco is pretty darn good.",

We have engineered hardwood flooring and this is so easy to use we run it every day. I hardly use my regular vacuum. It maneuvers easily and feels like it is self propelling. I was having a hard time prior to this with vacuuming then mopping but has cut down our cleaning time significantly. The water tank is small so I do have to refill it once while doing the floors downstairs. The battery time is theoretically limited but I've never ran out of battery life while cleaning.,

This thing eats green beans, rice, other foods, cat hair, and cat puke like nothing else! I should have bought it ages ago!

skyboxer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,the United States,15-Feb-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,Have owned since Christmas and use it on laminate flooring. It's salt tracking weather now and it works well for that but requires frequent tank empty + refills now that the floor gets so filthy.

W Hilton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent cleaner which takes the work out cleaning wood flooring and carpet,the United States,6-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This is just a well thought out product.  I've owned other wet/dry floor cleaners but this has been the best so far. Pros: solid floor (laminate) cleaning, cordless with a docking station, and self-cleaning. Cons: clean water tanks and dirty water tanks are a bit small. The tanks are sufficient for cleaning a good size room but have to be emptied before and after self-cleaning. Would definitely purchase again.",

The dwt is a pain in the butt to put back on. If you have pets, hair will get clogged in the debris channel, so that will have to be cleaned every few uses or more if you have multiple pets.

If there were an ability to get a larger one for each it would be totally amazing. I don't mind the added weight etc. This item is much better than the bissell crosswave.,
Nagel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing vac,the United States,2-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Great vacuum, sucks up decently large debris. I've used it and done a wipe test with a paper towel and spray to see if it missed anything. Nothing missed. Only gripe is, my floors are so dirty (have 2 dogs), that I need to click the self clean button a few times before the roll is clean again. But no biggie. I'm just always amazed by how much dirt this thing finds.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job,the United States,18-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Have not had this unit very long,  however I have used it extensively.  It does a great job without any issues, does not leave streaks, floor was left very clean without hazing. The only thing that I can say is the clean water cup is a bit on the small side,  but it does not really affect how the unit operates. I can do my house on a single charge, although my house is not huge.",
Randall L Toler,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good unit, bad availability of cleaning solution",the United States,4-May-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,The machine works very well. The floors were filthy in the home we just bought and it really did a great cleaning job. The problem is the manufacturer says to only use their cleaning solution or it may damage the cleaner and the cleaning solution can't be found.,
Dhir Lotwala,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's very easy to use!,the United States,18-Aug-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I'm happy about how well it worked on our kitchen floor. My husband always spilled some wine or juice on the ground. I don't have to bend my knee to wipe the stain with wet towel anymore.Wireless vacuum cleaner is a time saving. I highly recommend it if you have a wood floor and a kitchen floor like ours.,
jake,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE,the United States,7-Sep-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I love this product. It makes mopping a breeze and with a new puppy it's been a lot of help keeping your house clean. I only wish they had a bigger model for days when I want to clean the whole house as it can take a while to charge between 2-25 minute sessions.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life?,the United States,12-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Just the cleaning tool I have been waiting for.  I like the dual tanks so I am always using clean water.  I used it on ceramic tile, laminate tile and sealed hardwood floors.  I was embarrassed by the amount of dirt there was in the dirty water tank.The only thing I would change is the size of the clean water tank and length of time on one charge.  I just plan my cleaning so I can put it on the charger intermittently.Highly recommend this product.",
Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,30-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I absolutely love my Tineco. It does its job but definitely listen to the rule on where it says dont use on unsealed floors because it really doesn't work on them. I tried it down in my basement on the laminate and there were a couple cracks and it just kept shoving water into it.,
Lance Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy this,the United States,24-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Most amazing thing I have purchased. Really fantastic product. I use this every day to mop my hardwood floors. Easy to clean, and so much easier to use than a mop. Really gets everything clean.",

Lvuwthasml,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the price!,the United States,5-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I really like the Tineco vacuum/mop. It has made my life sooo much easier.

I refused to buy my wife a vacuum for her birthday, but alas she talked me into it. Not even 1 hour into getting it she was smashing eggs on her moms kitchen floor and the kids were happily throwing condiments to the wind. Have no doubt though. She tinecoed that right up. But wasn‚Äôt done there, those fresh cage free farm eggs. Must‚Äôve had a whoopsie cause one of those hit the ground and exploded too. Not to worry Tineco for the win!!! One plus side is, I‚Äôm not allowed to use it.",
Shelly Bell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased.,the United States,8-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I use this for hardwood floors, slate and ceramic tiles. It is amazing to see how clean the floors are and they dry so quickly. When I first starting using the Tineco, I thought the cleaning of the machine was tasking. Now that I know what I am doing it is rather easy and the machine is cleaned very thorough. Very pleased and awesome product.",
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can‚Äôt live without our tineco,the United States,16-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,We absolutely love our tineco. With a family of seven plus a dog I don‚Äôt think think I could run our household without it. We originally bought a bissell crosswave but after the first use it began to lead water all over our floor so back it went. We decided to try tineco and I‚Äôm so glad we did! I use it every day. It‚Äôs quick and easy to clean and does a better job cleaning than the bissell. Hands down. 10/10 would recommend.,
S. Shalabi,5.0 out of 5 stars,How did I live without this?,the United States,10-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I love this! My apartment has never been cleaner, and I can get it done in a shorter amount of time.

Billy smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gets 2 jobs done in 1 operation!,the United States,30-Jun-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Daily use on my tile floors and amazed how much dog hair this thing sucks up.

Apache Guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better Than A Crosswave!,the United States,10-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I have two dogs and use this to help keep the hardwood floors clean. Easy to use and enjoy the self cleaning feature. The clean water tank is a little small but the job that this Ifloor does on the floor, I can tolerate having to fill the tank a couple of times if I'm cleaning a big room. The extra rollers are hard to find, but did find them on Ebay. They were out of stock on Amazon and on the company website. Very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to everyone.",

Krista,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed,the United States,13-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,My vacuum/mop has quit working.  It will suction for a few seconds and then stop.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!!,the United States,4-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Waited to write a review until I'd had time to use it extensively. Picks up dust, dirt, pet hair, cat litter....does it all. Keeps hard floors like new. Super convenient - I don't have to supplement any cleaning with separate sweeping or mopping anymore. Doesn't leak like some of the name brands do. Definitely worth the money.",

Kenneth d swift,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great for Pet Friendly Homes,the United States,22-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I use this everyday, a couple times a day. It has made cleaning my floors so much faster and easier. I have 3 dogs, we're in rainy season and the floors are mostly wood and tile. Cleaning it out afterwards is an easy process as well. I love that there is no cord I'm plugging into a bunch of different places to worry about and the self cleaning function gets most of the debri up into the tank. My favorite gift so far this year.",

Like the voice prompts but will turn that off after I know the machine. Helps to be a detail person to be willing to take the time to clean it carefully.

Between a great dane and a husband these floors are a constant battle. Of course I pick up large debris before using. But this pretty much eliminates the sweeping.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick cleaning time,the United States,23-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Love this cleaner. Have a house full of tile this cuts cleaning time in half and does an excellent job of cleaning. The only down side is like most cleaners it does not get close to the walls.

It won‚Äôt even turn on for more than a second on the base and can‚Äôt self clean because it only turns on for a split second while on the charging base even with it saying full battery.

Kendra Pierce,3.0 out of 5 stars,Solid 3 stars. Won‚Äôt return but won‚Äôt recommend to anyone.,the United States,26-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,,"This machine hasn‚Äôt saved me anytime. I still have to use another vacuum for corners, edges, and rugs as it doesn‚Äôt have the ability to turn off the mop feature. It‚Äôs very convenient for under tables and such but you‚Äôll still have to have multiple devices. This is after two weeks of owning.Cons:1. It can only do 2-3 rooms before you have to empty all containers and such. Sometimes you even have to stop and run a self clean cycle between.2. The only cleaning fluid you can use is theirs and it doesn‚Äôt smell good or smell clean.3. I have streaks.4. Doesn‚Äôt like hair. It won‚Äôt go into the container and I have to pick it out. Every single time. It‚Äôs also wrapped all around the roller.5. Because it has so many fancy features it‚Äôs more chances of things going wrong. Two weeks in and I keep getting errors or ‚Äúempty water tank‚Äù warnings and it‚Äôs completely empty.Pros:1. Fluid dries fast. Even though it doesn‚Äôt smell good, I‚Äôm able to vacuum and mop quickly for large open spaces.2. It‚Äôs great for under tables or rugs where you won‚Äôt have to sweep and then mop.3. It‚Äôs lightweight and small. It fits under cabinets.4. The dirty floor indicator.Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this. I think people are caught up in a fad of this being cooler and better then it is. It needs improving. If I had bought this in store, I‚Äôd return but it‚Äôs to much trouble online.",3
Jbr043,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Crosswave comparison,the United States,9-Jan-21,Color: Ifloor3,,"Daily mopper, 2 babies, 1 dog, 1 catI got this product as a gift from my husband to replace my 3 year old Crosswave. We have babies so I‚Äôm a little obsessed with keeping my floors clean. I‚Äôve used it daily since it arrived and I am VERY impressed with this machine. The following is a comparative review based on my use of the Crosswave.Pros: 1. Cordless‚Äîmy original vac/mop had a cord, making its use much more difficult. Without a cord, you‚Äôre able to completely clean an area without worrying about sucking up the cord.2. The arrangement‚Äîthe tanks are VERY easy to fill and connect. There‚Äôs no twist top and nothing to dump upside down, as with my last machine. The clean tank has a flip-top; pop the top, fill with water and your cleaner, close and insert into the machine. The dirty tank is easily removed from the front; you rinse and replace.3. It‚Äôs light AND self-propelled‚Äîthe weight of the machine is a plus on its own but the fact that you don‚Äôt have to physically push it makes it‚Äôs weight even more amazing. The thing glides along the floor beautifully.4. It‚Äôs quiet‚Äîmy previous machine was loud. The Tineco iFloor 3 is so quiet I can use it while my babies sleep.5. My favorite part is IT CLEANS ITSELF! My least favorite part of my previous machine was cleaning it. The roller was so yucky; it required me to fill the base with water and stand there with it ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù the machine. That process did little cleaning, however, and I spent a lot of time hand cleaning the machine and roller myself. The Tineco alerts you when it needs to be cleaned; you dump the dirty tank, fill the clean tank, place it on the charger, press a button and watch it do magic. The dirty tank fills with dirt and grime accumulated on the roller and inside the machine. IT IS THE EASIEST EVERRRRR!Cons:The only thing I see as a problem is it sometimes has a hard time with my cat‚Äôs hair. I will occasionally find a matted, wet ball of hair on the floor after mopping. This isn‚Äôt a big deal to me at all and in no way an indicator of the machine‚Äôs abilities.I will update when I‚Äôve had the machine longer!",2
Amazonshopperqueen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best floor cleaner I've ever used! 2nd time is a charm!,the United States,20-Apr-21,Color: Floor One S3,,"This is the best machine ice ever used in my life for cleaning floors! I first bought a bissell crosswave. I was SORELY DISSAPPOINTED! After a month of the crosswave making the room smell like pee every time I started it up, I decided we had to do something different! So I went just a little more expensive and BOY AM I GLAD I DID! This machine got to each of the edges and corners and left NOTHING on my floor. It even tells u how dirty your floors are and adjusts it's cleaning power to meet your floors needs! It's notifies you when u run out of clean water AND when the DIRTY water tank is full! It always smells fresh and clean right after I'm done cleaning! This thing is AMAZING and if I had known how awesome it was, I could have kept the over $300 I WASTED on the stupid crosswave that left just one line of water in a puddle that I always ended up cleaning MANUALLY! The Tineco gets the WHOLE FLOOR CLEAN! It even freshens up your area rugs! It has an app where u can adjust it and no matter WHAT U ARE CLEANING it smells like a nice fresh clean floor every single time! I can walk on my floor now without worrying about what that is stuck to my foot or why there always FEELS like crumbs even when u don't SEE any crumbs! The Tineco GETS IT! No matter what ""IT"" is, the Tineco will clean it off your floor, and it won't ALLOW you to mess it up! It tells u if something needs cleaned. It cleans ITSSELF very well for the most part! I'm in love! Bissell has lost a good customer for life! Especially if I don't get my money back!",One
Tara Anna,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute garbage after 2 weeks,the United States,29-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,,"UPDATE 01/31/2021 : After 2 weeks it kept losing power, it would say the dirty water tank was full when it was empty and it would shut itself off. I emailed Tineco customer service because you CAN NOT reach them by phone, you must leave a message. I cleaned the machine about 10 times as per their YouTube video instructions.  It began working again but only for a couple days before it began doing the exact same things again. I‚Äôve now tried cleaning it another 15+ times (not an exaggeration) and it STILL won‚Äôt work properly.  Amazon is sending a replacement, hopefully it works for more than 2 weeks for $300. üôÑAbsolutely LOVEEEEE this thing.  With just plain water it cleans the dirt off my floors wonderfully.  I have 3 dogs and they track in a lot of mud on their feet and my hard floors always look filthy.  This makes it so easy to clean the floor each time they come inside and track dirt in.  I had the Hoover Floormate Deluxe and it did an awful job up sucking back up the water it put down and left my floors very wet after cleaning them.  I also took a paper towel and wiped the floor and the paper towel was super dirty after I JUST ran the floormate. I‚Äôm SO happy I have the Tineco S3 now. Leaves my floors not only clean but practically dry!!  I highly recommend this if you have pets.",One

No charging. Customer service is horrible. It took a week and multiple contact methods to finally get a response. I asked to speak to someone in charge when I was asked to find a large enough box and ship the broken machine myself and then wait for them to repair it and send it back. Two weeks and multiple requests for a call from a Manger later, I recieved a voice-mail that gave me the same number that no one ever answers.

I have included a video vacuuming post breakfast. I did squirt out the rest of their squeeze packs to really check out how well it did. Hopefully the vacuum holds up well, but so far I am in love. With the twins, sometimes I can get them to nap at the same time and others not. Even if they are I usually only have enough time to sweep and mop up their mess and wash bottles before they are up again. With this wet dry vac I can vacuum and mop at the same time even while they are asleep because it is so quiet. MAJOR time saver. No more after bedtime sweeping and mopping! And I can do it while they are awake without worrying about them going through dirt piles and crawling on sopping wet floors. This vacuum is so convenient. I feel like it should also be on every new parents baby registry. I have tile in two bathrooms, kitchen, and living room. I am able to do it all on a single charge.",One

Go get a mani/pedi? Actually start dinner on time? So many possibilities!We have a roomba. A dyson. A handheld cordless vac. THIS BEATS THEM ALL. The majority of our house is hardwoods and with young kids and a large dog - and husband, let's be real - the S3 works better than anything I've ever tried. I absolutely LOVE the self-propelling feature. It's so easy to use. I don't need to sweep first and mop second. And unless you have huge chunks of stuff on the floor, it picks everything up with ease and leaves the floors squeaky clean. It also has an extra power button you can push if you need to go over a certain area that has more dirt/spillage - conserving the power until you really need it. I've only had it since Christmas but I've used it almost every day. I can clean 75% of my house in 20 minutes, and it's 2700 sq. ft.GET IT. YOU WILL HAVE NO REGRETS.

Magical Selan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Life-changing, but not perfect",the United States,12-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,,"I have a Hoover Floormate at home, but have been out of town visiting family for several weeks to help with child care.  Said child is a messy little monster, and spills and all sorts of other stuff happen all of the time.  Due to lower body issues, I cannot do any hard cleaning, and the state of the floors was starting to give me anxiety.  So, after doing some research, I made my sister order this machine rather than a Floormate.  Let me tell you, this has saved my relationship with my family, because I was ready to give up and go home rather than live in this mess.This machine has several advantages over the Hoover Floormate:- More lightweight- Cordless, so no fiddling with cables that you can get tangled in- It's easier to maneuver, and gets into tighter spaces- Does not leave the floor as wet- Self cleaning!!However, it also has a few drawbacks:- Not as much scrubbing power with the roller brush- No way to shoot jets of additional water to moisten dried/caked on messes- From what I am reading, the cleaning solution will be hard to findThose drawbacks make it lose one star, but I would still buy this one over the Floormate again.",

The only one that didn‚Äôt leave my floors streaky was the spin mop but it‚Äôs so much work and trying to keep my 3 kids under 4 out of the mop water was impossible. Cue in the tineco and my floors have never been cleaner. It‚Äôs slim enough to get under my cabinets. Doesn‚Äôt leave my floors streaky. It‚Äôs super easy and not back breaking labor. Cleaning it out after wards is simple and easy. The only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù I guess I could have is I wish it cleaned closer to the walls whether going against the wall or with it. But it not that big of a deal to me. I‚Äôm obsessed and I‚Äôm only two days in. I will be back to update! Also, want to add my video is showing a mopped area vs an unmopped area.

RemyJax,2.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review,the United States,25-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,,"As a mop it works well.  I loved that it self propels and you just guide it.  It's easy to use.  It's easy to setup.  The charging dock is great.  I have 3 cats and 2 dogs and there was still pet hair on my floor after two complete cleanings.  This vacuum leaves an inch gap when you're against the wall.  So it doesn't exactly clean your entire floor.  If you let it sit for a second while it's off it leaves a water line on the floor.  The self cleaning could be better.  I ran it twice before each use and there was still pet hair left behind.  I vacuum my entire 1800 sq ft house every day with a regular vacuum or cordless, so there wasn't much pet hair on the floor to begin with.  I love having multiple vacuums, especially pet vacuums.  It's heavy.  Lastly, back to self cleaning, it's horrible.  I still had to rinse and wipe the waste water container.  Disgusting.  And, like I said before, the self cleaning brush part was lacking.  Overall, I would not recommend this wet vacuum to pet owners.  It would be much better as just a mop, not both.  It still has a way to go to be just right.",

Kayla West,5.0 out of 5 stars,MUST BUY ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE PETS,the United States,27-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,,"I got this as a gift for Christmas and was honestly skeptical about how well it would work as wet/dry combos in the past have been a nightmare for me. This thing is amazing! I used it as just a dry vacuum the first time to test its suction and it‚Äôs great! I have 2 shedding terriers and a cat and it sucked up hair balls like a dream! It also sucked up bigger things like food crumbs, small leaves, debris and even some foam from a toy my dogs destroyed.Today I used it as the wet/dry combo and was even more impressed! It does a great job of mopping without leaving an excess amount of water behind. This allowed me to clean my two bathrooms and put their rugs back down immediately. The floors dry super fast so I don‚Äôt have to worry about telling my husband not to move around our place for awhile which is huge! The only thing I did notice is for ground on dirt/messes, I had to go over the area a handful of times but it‚Äôs still easier than mopping by hand.Since it was working so well I decided to use this on a disgusting area of my floor I have not swept or mopped in quite some time and was again impressed. It picked up globs of hair and mopped right through it. I got a little concerned as I noticed it was starting to leave some hair behind on the floor after that but then I realized the digital display was telling me it was dirty and needed to self clean. So in the midst of cleaning my floors I popped it on it‚Äôs base, hit self clean, waited for it to clean itself out (~1min) and kept going with no further issues.In summary, this thing is amazing especially for a house with pets!!",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,KEEP THE BOX!,the United States,25-Aug-21,Color: Floor One S3,,"For 2 months, I loved my mop. It worked great. Then over the weekend (when customer service is closed) it stopped working completely and told me to contact customer service.I finally got in touch with costumer service and walked through all the trouble shooting with them. I was then told it was under warranty and I would get an email that would tell me how to get my mop replaced. After receiving the email, I jumped through all the hoops they asked of me. Over 24 hours after responding with all of the information asked of me, I received another email asking to package up my mop and bring it to fedex. Once  they received it they would fix it and send it back to me. Who keeps the package for 2 months? How long is this going to take? What am I supposed to do in the meantime?So now I have to buy a box, find a fedex, send my EXPENSIVE mop back, and wait around for them to fix it and ship it back? I spent ALOT of money for something that I only got to use for 2 months! An now I have to spend more money and waste my time to hopefully get my mop fixed.Save your time and money.

Jake,1.0 out of 5 stars,Please read if you‚Äôre considering buying this!,the United States,22-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,,"I was really excited to try this vacuum after wanting to purchase a vacuum for months. I saw multiple TikTok videos on it and everyone claimed it was ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. I finally decided to make my purchase and I must say the very first day I opened it, I regretted it. The suction power is awful, also it does not vacuum big chunks. I thought you could use it on carpets, but it‚Äôs basically a mop, only good on hardwood floor. It only sucks up tiny tiny pieces and it hardly does a nice job cleaning. You have to constantly refill it and drain it. I literally vacuum for 6-7 minutes and the clean water solution empties super quickly and the dirty water needs to be emptied. It‚Äôs been about 3 days and I think mine is already malfunctioning because it told me to empty the dirty tank when nothing was in it. I‚Äôm really disappointed in this vacuum, maybe I got a bad one, but this is nothing like how it was advertised. It probably only has hype because of TikTok. Not worth it!!",2
Jordyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,OBSESSED,the United States,22-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,,"I used a Bissell Pet Crosswave for the last year and it was okay biggest perk was I didn‚Äôt have to vacuum then mop but I was never very impressed. Finally bought this beauty and I‚Äôm in love with it. I was nervous about the battery life but I‚Äôm cleaning over 3,000sqft of hard floors and haven‚Äôt been under 50% battery. The floors are pretty darn clean after too. It blows the crosswave out of the water in every way honestly. Floors are cleaner, drier, less streaky, the machine is quieter (super quiet actually) and much more efficient. I clean prefinished hardwoods and tile it works perfectly on both. Also the self cleaning cycle is an amazing feature. If you‚Äôre into cleaning area rugs though it won‚Äôt work for that like the crosswave but I am not cleaning any area rugs so it‚Äôs not a drawback. It does have about and inch gap when you‚Äôre trying to clean against a wall but so did the crosswave. This machine is worth every penny. I would also recommend you stock up on the cleaner when it‚Äôs in stock you only use a capful so it lasts a long time but it sells out all the time.",
Shonta Ledbetter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Altering Cleaning Device,the United States,13-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,,"I rarely write extensive product reviews but this machine is life altering and I have to share my experienceI live in a 7 person multigenerational household as a single mom to multiple children. My children‚Äôs ages are 20 (x2), 15, 11, 5 and the 1yo grandbaby. We also have 5 dogs (2 indoor). I have a full time job, part time job and I run a small business. I‚Äôm saying all of that to say, I don‚Äôt have time/energy to clean like I wish I did‚Ä¶and teenagers don‚Äôt give a crap about how clean the house is or completing their chores properly. With my schedule I‚Äôm burned out and tired of living in filth. Aaaand I don‚Äôt have a dedicated house servant (aka, wife/partner‚Ä¶stay at home moms I feel your pain‚Ä¶.and send my love your way‚Ä¶because your job is difficult, painful and thankless).Now for the Tineco. I researched and obsessed over reviews for machines like this for over a week before pulling the trigger. I watched YouTube videos‚Ä¶read all of the negative reviews‚Ä¶all that. Shoot, if I‚Äôm gonna spend $400 of my hard earned money on a cleaning device‚Ä¶it better move my soul. I was looking at this machine and the Bissell version. After comparing the bad reviews between each machine is opted to spend the extra $100 to buy the Tineco.My Tineco came in just a few days ago. We named her Sparkles because man does she make our floor sparkle and shine! Finally I can sweep/mop our floors and they are CLEAN! Like clean clean.  No crumbs, no streaks, dries super fast and I can run it while the grandbaby sleeps.I‚Äôm completely smitten. The first few runs of the machine the dirty water tank was just black, disgusting and dirty as all get out. But now after running it twice a day for the past few days the dirty water tank is a lighter shade of grey. And it self cleans with the exception of rinsing out the dirty water tank which is super easy. I can walk out of my room barefoot to get my coffee in the morning without stepping in a million snack crumbs and raging around the kitchen in flip flops with a broom at 5:30 am because my kids ‚Äúforgot to sweep‚Äù the floor the night before.My only small complaint is that I wish the roller brush was less like a paint roller and had some scrubby notches on it sorta like a kitchen sponge to scrape up any crusted items a little better. I‚Äôm sure that wouldn‚Äôt be safe for delicate floors which is probably why the brush is so soft. It also doesn‚Äôt reach the 1-2 inches around the edge of the floors or suck any crumbs from the edges. Those are good things to know so you aren‚Äôt disappointed.If you‚Äôre considering a machine like this just buy it. It will change your life and your feet will thank you!",

Also I wish dumping the dirty water was a little more hands free as well (I ultimately have to reach my hand in the get out stuck debri, hair etc‚Ä¶. Very gross). If you don‚Äôt have tons of open floor space, this isn‚Äôt for you. I enjoy using it occasionally but always dread cleaning it.",2
sammantha Benjamin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the cross wave,the United States,12-Jun-21,Color: Floor One S3,,"Initially I loved this machine, but after 6 months of owning it I had full system failure and there was nothing I could do to fix it so I had to ship it back to the company. It has been gone three weeks now and no one knows where my machine is.If you have level floors this machine is great and efficient, especially if it‚Äôs a fresh mess. I do love that you only need one small cap full of cleaning solution per container of water, which means the solution it comes with lasts a very long time. I also love that every piece that dirty things Pass through are removable and cleanable, tineco gives you a special brush to clean everything but I some times use my hand to pull hair out that is to long to get into the dirty tank.If you have floors that aren‚Äôt level you will have water left on the floor that it can‚Äôt pick up, even if you go over it multiple times in different directions.",
Courtney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ditch your crosswave and get this üòç,the United States,6-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,,"This thing is absolutely phenomenal.I originally purchased the Bissell Crosswave a couple months back, and was pleased with it, but I kept seeing comparisons of the Tineco S3 vs the Bissell Crosswave, and it seemed that the S3 greatly outperformed the Crosswave. So I sold my Crosswave and bought the Tineco S3. My oh my, I am SO glad I did.The Tineco S3 is lighter and easier to maneuver. It basically pushes itself, whereas the Crosswave definitely needs some muscle behind it. The S3 is much quieter, nicer looking, has voice commands (tells you when it needs to be self cleaned), an auto mode, it‚Äôs much less bulky, etc. The Tineco S3 truly makes it EASY to clean. My floors have never been cleaner, mostly because I despise having to sweep/vacuum and then mop & then wait for it to dry üôÑ. Too much effort, ha. This is hands down the best purchase I‚Äôve made in my adulthood. Honestly I can‚Äôt even accurately put into words how amazing this device is.If you have a Bissell crosswave, sell it and buy this. Seriously, you won‚Äôt regret it (you‚Äôll actually be mad you didn‚Äôt do it sooner lol.)",

This cleans about as good as a kids pretend vacuum or mop does.  It's ok if your floors are already clean, have no debris or dried on spills, you've already swept along the walls and cabinet bases, etc.  This machine should be considered a 'buffer' and not an actual floor cleaner.  If you have a typical home with kids or pets or - eeeeek, both - you will get nothing but frustration from using this appliance.  You can get your floors clean faster & easier using a Swifter mop.",One

I use it through out the day every day! My kids drags in mulch sand u name it they bring it in. It sucks up everything!! Chunks of pineapple mulch sand play-doh stuck on marshmallows. Globs of spaghetti! Seriously amazing!! Now these people cleaning the rollers I‚Äôm sorry but take it apart as it says ‚Äúplease clean dirty water tank and Chanel! U need to wipe it down and out. Underneath the cover to the roller in and out literally it self cleans the roller not the whole dang thing! I simply have mine in my laundry room with a roll of paper towels I wipe it toss it and works fine if u have a defect which CAN happen here and there it is like any other company defects happen ‚Äúgod forbid‚Äù email them! Their amazing! If u don‚Äôt want to try and help yourself that‚Äôs on you!!! Also another tip use hot water it cleans much better I thought that was common scene and here n there clean ur dang filter! Use some vinegar don‚Äôt soak them lord but clean it gently or replace it! I got mine from Best Buy just bc they are the only one with a 5 year warranty compared to here which is 3 years! To add on tips (sorry for hoping around on wording) when u pull out ur roller, make sure u push the micro fibers out twigs it counter clockwise to lift the fibers.",

Mikaila,3.0 out of 5 stars,Might not be for you!,the United States,25-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,,"First off, I should start by saying this vacuum makes my floors look decent and feel great. This being said that could be because they are only 2 week old tile. If you are looking for a vacuum that will take out having to get on the floor and scrubbing those dried spots, this is DEFINITELY not for you. Vacuuming is alright but if you have a good amount of debris it will set itself into self cleaning mode meaning you have to take it back to the charger to wait and clean the take before using again. Tank is super small but it‚Äôs also not a big deal having to refill. When you intentionally do the self clean option it‚Äôs great! Really makes the cleaning of the vacuum super easy! I definitely don‚Äôt think that this vacuum is worth the hype but I‚Äôm going to keep trying to use it to maybe change my mind. I will say this leaves NO STREAKS OR RESIDUE which is the only reason I‚Äôm going to keep giving it a chance. I should add that if you have big house this probably isn‚Äôt the right one for you since you can‚Äôt do the whole house in one sitting. It last for 25 mins on eco mode (kinda like med-low speed) and 18 on max mode (high). It takes about 5 hours to charge so keep that in mind.I will be updating if my mind changes. Maybe I got a dud, we‚Äôll see!",

This vac pick up everything from straw/hay pieces, bits of food to sand and pet hair.  It‚Äôs easy to take apart and clean. It runs best with hot water on my tile floor. I don‚Äôt suggest hot water on real wood floors.  It has not faded my wood floors and it Drys in seconds.  I can walk over what I just cleaned and I don‚Äôt end up with wet socks.  I have really enjoyed it so far.  I saw a few reviews about Burnt motors, so I will update in several months.  The vac is worth the hype!  My life is changed.

"""rpb59""",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Hardwood Vacuum and Washer Cleaner !!!,the United States,17-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,,The Tineco Floor One S3 Vacuum and Washer has above average cleaning ability that I'm saving about 30 minutes each time I clean my floors now.  The Wi-Fi link to the internet and the cell phone app has to be the real changing factor in making this the #1 - hardwood cleaner as I never have to worry about knowing when to add in the clean water or remove the dirty water as it tells me automatically.  The self-cleaning tools are also set up to tell me when it it needs to clean the vacuum itself.  To top this off the price that COSTCO is selling them for beats any of the competition just look in the Special Event item listing.,
Angelica,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, amazing floor cleaner!!",the United States,22-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,,"Ok, I‚Äôve had this for about a month and I seriously love it so much! I love walking barefoot on my floors after cleaning them with my Tineco. I have all tile flooring, a family of five, which includes three teens... I also have 3 dogs and 1 cat. I live in a new construction neighborhood where there‚Äôs always so much dust and dirt flying around. My floors manage to accumulate a lot of dust and hair with so much traffic in and out of the house.This vacuum/mop picks it all up! AND leaves a squeaky clean floor!!. :)I honestly don‚Äôt even realize how much hair and dirt are on my floors until I empty the canister. It‚Äôs just crazy and amazing. I love it!!It has a pretty cool self cleaning feature but you need to empty and rinse out the dirty water canister afterwards.",
Karissa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but some annoyances,the United States,20-Dec-20,Color: Floor One S3,,So the tineco s3 is great. Like my floors look so clean and it really cleans my rugs. And even got an old stain up. But it can‚Äôt hang with a lot of dog hair.  And I have 4. It works best if you sweep up the dog hair first. It has a super small water tank but a huge debris tank. But it gets an inch of dirty water in it and it stops and tells you to clean it and the brush roll has an auto clean. It‚Äôs kind of annoying to stop and clean it every 5 minutes but it was a Christmas gift from my husband so I love it anyway.,
Yiwen Li,5.0 out of 5 stars,Precise Cleaning and Cordless Option,the United States,12-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,,"What I like about this product is that it cleans very well and leaves no dust and dirt on the floor once cleaned. It mops and can vacuum the floor at the same time which is a better option than the current mop I have. Setting and assembling the vacuum was very easy and only read the instructions to see how much cleaner liquid I need to add into the tank along with water. My entire house is pretty much hard floor and with this vacuum, it made my mopping experience even better since it didn't take much time as I would usually do on a daily basis with my previous mop. I don't need to over pump water onto the floor as the vacuum does it automatically for you as you move it across the floor. Usually vacuums that clean floors don't come with brushes and cleaner liquid, but this product did come with it.Like I said before, my entire house is hard floor and I'm loving this cordless option as I don't have to unplug the cord every time as I move up and down my house. Compared to the other options I had in the past, this is pretty light for me. Personally for me, it can run up to 35 minutes on a single charge which is enough for me to clean around. I'm also very impressed that there is a tank for clean and dirty water so it doesn't get mixed up in the process of cleaning. I love this option.Some cons I noticed is that the vacuum cannot clean corners and edges based on how the vacuum was engineered and made. This didn't stop me from having an amazing experience with the vacuum. Sometimes it leaves a speck of water on the floor but it's not a big problem for me. Overall, this vacuum is a product that is worth investing to. Exceeds most of my expectations when it comes to cleaning.",

Kristen Furbay,5.0 out of 5 stars,GAME CHANGER,the United States,17-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,,"So I honestly rarely write reviews.. but this thing deserves all the hype! First of all, it‚Äôs super easy to use and set up. When I turned it on for the first time I didn‚Äôt realize it was going to move on it‚Äôs own & I almost dropped it. Since it helps you move it, I didn‚Äôt feel sore or tired after using it. I had to dump the tank 3 times while using it and used the whole battery life by the time I was done. My floors didn‚Äôt look or feel dirty.. but my god, after dumping the tank I may have wanted to puke a little. When you‚Äôre done you put it back on the charger and it self cleans... then you dump the tank and boom you‚Äôre done. It has like 5 parts and doesn‚Äôt require a lot of work after you‚Äôre done using it. If you‚Äôre a mom & on the fence, get it! I have a toddler and this thing is easy, quick and efficient.

So far so good with our black Labrador dog hair! Light weight which I love. It moves and twists and turns easily. Goes through an automatic system cleaning when put back in the base.,

After one month the vacuum stopped sucking up the muddy water and started spreading it on my wood floor and tile. I only used it two days a week, it was never damaged, I used the self clean cycle after every use. I took care of it (why wouldn‚Äôt I when it costs $400). Well I contacted Tineco customer support and sent videos and pictures and did all the trouble shoots and they ended it with ‚Äúwell our vacuum doesn‚Äôt work on tile and unsealed floors‚Äù. Even though when I first bought it, it cleaned the tiles and wood floor pristinely.

This made me unable to even use it. After talking with customer service, none of the fixes corrected the issue and I ended up sending it back to them to fix it. My Tineco got lost in transit and it took me going back and forth with customer service for about a month before they decided to send me a new one. Once I got my new one, it took two minutes for me to run into the exact same problem.I‚Äôm not sure how it has gotten so many great reviews!

It is all that it says it is and more. It sweeps & mops at the same time-talk about saving time! Who wouldn't love that. I often use it in the kitchen floor & dining room then I can go right into the living room and on & on if I want. The only thing to stop me is if I have to change the water or empty the dirty water. They have made it so simple. I really love it. It's so much better than have to get a mop bucket and the mop and that whole routine-AFTER you've swept and bent over for the dustpan (which I had a hard time doing because of back pain). And speaking of backbreaking work I've found that this is so much easier of my back that all the ""bending"" involved in sweeping & mopping. I am ecstatic about this purchase.

OrangeAlert,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Future Has Arrived.,the United States,12-Aug-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"THIS TineCo FLOORONE is so UTTERLY FANTASTIC. It is the ""future"" that has for so long been forecasted. It practically runs itself, it's attractive, tells me what to do, lights up and shows me how much dirt we're attacking. I have developed some kind of serious arthritis problem in my lower back. This unit is somehow self-propelled and requires nothing of me but to follow it and aim it in the right direction.People have noted one must stop to add more water. I did most of a house with floors that per the sensor were filthy. I used the optional capful of cleanser. I had to add water 3 times which took about 90 seconds each time, and dump out the much larger dirty reservoir twice, the second time when I was done. It did not depress me nor bother me nor feel like a poor design. It felt ""right in line"" with keeping everything moving fast and light. The reservoirs were designed MUCH BETTER than ones I have seen before. They did not drip nor require tightening anything up.I was SOOO overjoyed while using the device I couldn't stop remarking to the new rescue dog ""How much Mommy Like-eyed this new thing and boy was it getting the floors clean! It's 3:44 am and I'm writing this review to get the word out.You see: I had also bought the ""best voted"" Bissell Steam Mop. It's corded. And my concerns were not wrong.  My impression was this ""Good time Charlie"" wasn't really cleaning anything. Sure, the thick material picked up dirt, and most not all of the steam surface came in contact with the floor and sanitized it, but not as much as one would think. And then the semi-sanitized water that does break up mini coffee-spills?  It just spreads a thinner cleaner layer of the filth over a larger surface.  I used it twice two days ago. Then today MY FLOORS ACTUALLY GOT WASHED AND CLEANED AND THE MACHINE SAID IT WAS FILTHY! AND WHEN DONE? THE FLOOR WAS SO GORGEOUS I WOULD EAT OFF IT AND KNOW I HAD NO WORRIES. So for those of you doing other cleaning, then the steam? Maybe you are gold, like I said ""I don't know how to regular mop in the first place"".But those of you just using the steam, and maybe a lot, and perhaps cleaner than me to start? Don't forget: I've got some OCD and I think about dirt and germs an inordinate amount. I firmly believe that those steam mops are deceiving. UNLESS THE ENTIRE BOTTOM IS STAINLESS STEEL AND ALL OF IT EQUALLY CRANKING OUT STEAM TO WITHIN 1/4"" or 1/8"" from each edge? I think you are breaking up spills and stains and seeing dirt disappear, the fluffy cover is absorbing it, but the steam is also wetting it and ultimately as I said: you are smoothing a finer cleaner layer of dirty water over a larger surface and it is deceiving.JUST BUY THIS UNIT AND TRY IT ONCE!  YOU WILL PROTECT IT WITH YOUR LIFE, AND GET IT IT""S OWN GUARD DOG. IT's the FUTURE for under $300 bucks. And it performs like a Lamborghini where all these other devices? They are handing you a broom and a Pterodactyl and wishing you the best.  And from what everyone says? This company handles it's customers really well.I going to try to upgrade to their $699 top of the line vacuum. Why? Because this machine tonight? It CHANGED my life. I don't have money to burn, but I want their very best because I get to live in the future and have very-well mannered machines talk to me and do all the work and everything requiring elbow grease!",16

We have nearly half a house with hardwood and half with carpet, these two are my life-savers.The Tineco with its own cleaning solution can clean almost everything in an instant on the floor. The suction power is so great that the food leftovers thrown by my toddler girl disappear at once. It's a relief after cleaning the floor every night. It takes only 15 minutes to clean all the floor instead of using broom and traditional mop for more than half an hour. My husband even lies on the floor and says that this cleanliness is really comfortable.It is already helpful but i hope that the water tank would be bigger, so it will be easier to do the self-cleaning without filling it again.",13

I have back & neck issues & in fact just had neck surgery a few weeks ago but even after using this there was no pain as there typically is after I vacuum or mop because it glides on its own.Easy to clean but don't assume you can use it & toss it onto self cleaning mode & walk away because you cannot.  You have to disassemble the tank & brush each time for a thorough clean.We have a large house & used this to clean approx 2100 sq ft of it & by the end I still have 40% charge left over but do end up having to stop & empty the dirty water tank & add solution 3 times during the cleaning process..The bad..... Out of the gate this machine leaves streaks EVERYWHERE..  About 10 1 inch streaks with each swipe everywhere & no matter what I do, it's there so it makes it look like you have used a dirty machine throughout your house no matter what you do.  ....and it's not like I can say maybe I didn't properly clean the brush cause it started this way & has continued this way & it's for this purpose that I absolutely hate this machine & hope that I can return it & honestly do not recommend it in any way shape or form..

Elaria,4.0 out of 5 stars,Tik tok made me buy this,the United States,19-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Ok I bought this because of til tok....the base model that went viral sold out so I opted for this model. So far I am please with this mop. In fact I think it is near perfect. After 3 weeks of use my only 2 complaints are I really wish there was a separate sprayer to dispense a little extra water/solution for dried on messes. I have A toddler and she spills juice/milk and my dogs bring on dirt, so that sticks to it. The mop doesn‚Äôt pick up the mess with a few passes, it takes a good minute of back and fourth slowly over the spot, but I have found if you spray a little of your own diluted cleaner ( I use fabuloso) on the spot the mop has no problem picking it up with 1-2 passes. So I built in spray function would be most convenient. My second complaint is that you can‚Äôt use hardly any other cleaning solution last in the water tank. I like for my cleaning products to smell nice and the one that comes with it is order less AND apparently sold out because of the items popularity",6
Zachary Bulls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cool product,the United States,12-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"So before I decided to create this review I wanted to make sure I owned my tineco for a good minute to give it a good review. I received it December 12 and it is not January 12 so I have had it for a month. With my first use I of course thought this is the coolest thing ever where has it been all my life but there's more than meets the eye. I'll just break it down into pros and cons.PROS - it is convenient, VERY convenient. It is more easily accessible than a mop and having to actually put a mop together because normally you'll have to sweep/vacuum first then slap the mop on the floor after you make the water, etc.  This is readily available I just pop it off it's charger. I use it every other day so it gives time for the parts to dry. Cleaning the parts is very quick and easy and the tineco is still a time saver compared to other methods.It has a dirt detection. This feature is pretty neat. I love watching the detector go from red to blue. Makes me feel like it knows somthing i don't lol.It maneuvers amazingly well. Does better than my super expensive vacuum and takes no effort to move it left and right.It does pick up MOST of the dirt- not all in my opinion I can wipe a paper towel after it's wet track and still see dirt on it -but it isn't a TON. Which I am satisfied with because again it's still better than me having to lug my mop out everyday. It does just enough for me. And the aftermath that's in my dirty water tank when I'm done is pretty gruesome.It cleans itself. - seriously- and it does an amazing job - yes no more constantly ringing out those mops and spending forever getting them truly cleaned - one day I ran the self cleaning cycle 3 times just to make sure it was super clean and the water literally ran clear. It doesn't awesome. - DO take it apart still and get the gathered debris in the brush roller and clean the dirty water tank real well. It take 8 minutes at the most-Battery life is pretty good. Not much more to say about it. I can clean my house probably 4 or 5 times before having to charge it. I wouldn't know I keep it on the charger when I'm done lol.CONS- It doesn't scrub the way a regular mop would. Goodness this part sucks. I could have a speak of anything on the floor that just takes a small amount of pressure to it and the tineco will not get it up. I have to get a paper towel and one swipe it is up. TINECO PLEASE MAKE BETTER BRUSHROLLERS FOR THIS REASON. I would love a brush roller that will rub the surface a little more and get up the simplest of messes.It doesn't sanitize, not that I'm aware of anyway. It suggests not to use hot water and it suggests to only use the tineco solution. From my understanding the tineco solution does not sanitize -though it does smell wonderful- this would be helpful for people with small children who crawl and play on the floor. I choose not to use another solution in case the machine breaks. This thing was $300 I will not risk it. LOLI find the plastic head drags on the floor - is it just me? - I constantly hear the plastic pieces scratching the floor while using it. - though no physical scratches - almost as if the brush roller isn't big enough that the plastic head is dropping below it - again tineco PLEASE A BETTER BRUSHROLLER.It doesn't clean carpet. I have the shortest rug in my living room. Theres literally no fabric to it-i notice people say it will clean short rugs - I do not find it doesn't anything to it but make it wet and suck up loose debris. Do not expect it to do a nice deep clean - sorry you'll have to keep your carpet cleaning supplies on hand still. -Overall this is a really neat product. If you find yourself constantly cleaning messes this is a great item to invest in. Im a stay at home mom,  constantly cleaning up food and dog hair and outside messes so this was perfect for me. And I have an easier time keeping up with the floor.",2

The good is that it cleans floors that are not overly dirty. I have 2 dogs and we do wipe their feet when coming in but it took 2 times to really get the floor clean. The problem was the battery life when used in max mode was about 17 minutes so it took 4 charges (@ 30 min each) to complete the cleaning process. NOW for the reason for 1 star-the 3rd time I went to use it, I received a motor malfunction light and needed to call Customer Service. I spent 25 minutes on the phone and was told they will email me asking me to attach a video of what‚Äôs happening to finalize the work order.

The very first time I used it, I made sure to go slow and not rush because I knew the floors were very dirty and I wanted an accurate battery life. The battery got down to 20%, but I clean my floors daily (because it‚Äôs so easy) and the battery doesn‚Äôt get below 50% anymore because my floors are never that dirty. It takes 2-3 tanks of water to clean the whole house, and I always top it off after emptying the dirty water and running the self clean cycle.I really like the cleaner that comes in the box, it‚Äôs almost odorless.. but sometimes I will run it with a splash of vinegar instead of the cleaner.",One

I don't even have a box readily available or can easily find one to ship back a whole vacuum.  I didn't save the original box.  Anyway, not even sure if I sent it back when I would receive it back.  I had been using it religiously to clean my kitchen floor and other floors in the house.  I just feel like the machine shouldn't rust so quickly and why is it even rusting anyway?

It's a good vacuum cleaner but the noise, the tangling cord and the Bissell cleaning formula with strong odors have always been my complaints about it. I've heard some good stories about Tineco products and was hopeful this cordless vacuum cleaner can help me retire the Bissell. It turns out this is a great product and I am loving it! I'm amazed at how quiet the Tineco is. To put things in perspective, my 9 months old gets upset every time I run the Bissell (it's just too loud). She can be having a good sleep while I'm running the Tineco. And a quiet sleeping baby means the world to a mom. Also, the self cleaning feature is such a life saver. The only downside is the small size water tank. I have about 1000 square foot of hardwood floor to cover and I have to refill the water tank about 3 times which can be a little annoying.",One

Roy N.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As good as I've tried, but still not great",the United States,22-Dec-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Look, we all want that magical machine that will perfectly mop your dirty floors and make them look new again. This is not that. But then again, nothing is that.I have tried many different floor cleaners/robots/swiffers/moppers/steamers/etc and this is probably the best one. But it is still not five-stars-good. If your floors are really dirty the only way to get them clean is going to be to get on your hands and knees and scrub. I'm hoping that someday there will be a machine that can clean that good but I don't think it exists today.Some of the issues with this is that it can't clean close enough to walls. It doesn't have led lights like many other vacuums do. The clean water tank has to be refilled too often. The dirty water tank has to be emptied too often. The auto dirt detection doesn't work at all (it's only come on once for me even when I go over particularly dirty areas). There isn't much of a difference between regular mode and maximum mode. It won't clean your grout at all and if you have a textured floor it will struggle to get the recessed pits clean. Sometimes it's hard to hear and understand the voice prompts when the device is running. The battery doesn't last very long on a single charge. The battery is not replaceable so you can't have a backup battery, and that also means when the built in battery fails the device is toast.All that being said, it does a better job on tile than anything else I've used so I'm keeping it even though I returned just about everything else I've tried. That's the most praise I can give this thing.Some guidance in the instructions on cleaning technique would be helpful. I don't know how fast you are supposed to go over the floor. I always feel like I'm either going to fast (doesn't clean as well) or too slow (wastes cleaning solution).This thing is very expensive. If buying it is a financial stretch, don't do it because you think this is going to work miracles for you. But if you can afford to splurge on the best floor cleaner even though it is very imperfect, this will make your life easier. If you want truly clean floors, especially if you have grout lines or textured floors, this will not replace elbow grease.",
J,5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm am impressed,the United States,14-Jan-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I always thought my floors were pretty clean but I was wrong. The dirty water left in my tineco shocked me. The first few times I used it with just water and then I tried with the detergent. I did not feel that it cleaned more with the detergent though. I seem to have a problem with it telling me to clean the dirty water tank everytime I put it back on the charging station even after I have already cleaned it out. Sometimes it will tell me the clean water tank is empty and I will reinsert it a few times. I will have to contact tineco and see what they say but so far I am really enjoying it. It is light weight and easy to use and pretty much cleans itself! The app doesn‚Äôt do much other than tell you what the vacuum already tells you. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt die on me!,One

There is an easy-to-understand audio indicator that is triggered when water used for floor cleaning gets dirty.Regarding its heft, it's surprisingly light, even though the cleaner has multiple functions. It also stands upright easily without falling.Changing the water reservoir and filters are also extremely simple and straightforward.

On the second day, I cleaned all of my floors, and it was still at 38%.You have to add water (with cleaning solution) and empty the tank quite often, but I think it's worth it. This cuts my floor cleaning time in half because I am not having to sweep and then mop.What I love about this vacuum besides that it saves time and energy (my energy):It talks to you! It tells you when you need to add water, empty the dirty water container, when it needs to be cleaned or when it needs to be charged.It cleans itself! Once you place the vacuum on the charging dock, it will tell you if the brush roller needs to be cleaned. It cleans the brush roller very well.When you are sweeping/vacuuming the round screen on the top of the vacuum shows you where your floors need more cleaning, it goes from blue to red so you know where your floors need more time. Once the vacuum has picked up all of the dirt/mess it goes back to blue. How awesome is this??!! We have dogs that live in the house so we have dog hair and paw prints to clean up on a daily basis. Dog hair and muddy paw prints are no obstacle for this vacuum!My vacuum came with 2 filters, 2 brush rollers, the charging dock, a small brush, and a bottle of the cleaning solution.I love that the vacuum is cordless, to me,  it is worth the somewhat small battery life. The vacuum charges itself when it is on the dock and shuts off when it is done changing. I have calculated that the vacuum battery goes anywhere from 25 to 40 minutes depending on how dirty your floors are and the battery is fully charged (from 0) within 4 hours.I was curious how this vacuum would work on my rugs and I came along with the opportunity to do so yesterday. My daughter spilled water on my rug (probably a half of a cup). I used the vacuum to clean up the water and it sucked it right up. There was no watermark left after it dried up (yes, it was just water but we have light gray rugs that show everything). I am curious to see how this vacuum does on other spills but not curious enough to spill something on purpose lol!I watched many videos comparing this vacuum to the new Bissel vacuum that is similar to this one, and this one won me over.Overall, I love this vacuum/mop, I think this is a great buy and I use it every day.",
dkbethke,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little machine,the United States,27-Sep-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was not convinced any of the vacuum/ mop combos out there were worth the cost. A friend posted that she liked this product a lot so I decided to give it a try. I am happy I did!  This also has more positive reviews than the Bissel.  I have been able to use this upstairs and down in all rooms. I can get the whole house done - it does not lose charge or power. It has a button to increase speed for dirtier areas. I get plenty of those with 3 dogs running in and out all day. The amount of grit and sandy dirt it picks up is amazing. It cuts my cleaning time. I DO think it is worth the price.  I know you have to clean out the dirty water tank. But it has a self clean mode for the roller. And it does not take that long to do.I have been using this for over a month. And it works really well. The floors feel really clean - not gritty,  I know they have some models that are more expensive than this one so I‚Äôm now wondering how much better are they??  Maybe I should have gone for the best one, but so far happy with this purchase. Now to see how long it lasts with daily use.",
Zoom,5.0 out of 5 stars,An amazing machine,the United States,29-Aug-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"A big part of our house is covered with porcelain tiles. Cleaning them becomes a huge pain. We have tried steam mops, steam cleaners and brush mops, and needless to say, the floor has to be vacuumed first. The cleaning process is tedious, and washing the mops afterwards is no fun. We end up wasting a lot of money on various cleaning tools, but none of them gives us a satisfactory solution.Not anymore. I bought this cordless floor cleaner after a friend of mine recommended it to me. It is more expensive than the previous tools I bought, but I have been desperately looking for a tool that is actually effective, so I was willing to give it a try. So far I have used it several time, and I am very impressed.  The steps involved in the cleaning are very simple and straightforward. You charge the machine, put warm water in the top container with the cleaning solution (provided) and clean the floor. After the cleaning is done, you take out the container at the bottom (with the dirty stuff), remove the dirt, clean the container and put it back. When needed, you will be reminded by the machine to do a self-cleansing . All it takes is a push of the self-cleansing button, and the machine will fresh the system. All in all, this machine makes cleaning the tile floor much easier. I am very impressed with the product.",3
Denise,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why you should buy the Tineco,the United States,24-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Absolutely in love! Best purchase I have made to date! The Tineco is lightweight, which for me, someone with arthritis, is a big plus! I also have dogs and cats, so lots of hair and muddy paws. I‚Äôve had my Tineco for exactly a week and I have used it just about every day. It gets up every bit of hair, and loose particles on my hardwoods. The suction power is great, the machine is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù so it guides you when it needs to deep clean or spend a little more time on an area. The self cleaning function is hands down the best part of this vacuum. No more smelly mop or vacuum heads. I also used the Tineco for the first time in my bathroom on my ceramic tile floor, I am amazed. I have zero complaints! Highly recommend. Yes it‚Äôs pricey but given the fact you don‚Äôt have to sweep, vacuum and then mop, and it cleans itself when done, it‚Äôs worth every penny.",One
Kennesha,5.0 out of 5 stars,We are in love and We will be together forever.,the United States,18-Feb-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I have always used a regular mop with a bucket. But our relationship started going downhill after I had twins 3 years ago. Back aches, tired, stiff, I had no gusto. So the mop and I slowly started growing apart. I knew it was the end for us. Well I had a friend of mine post about this contraption. I was like wait... this thing mops and sucks up the crumbs i miss while sweeping? Then i had a client come in raving about the same machine. I knew then and there it was a sign I had to have this thing. I did what research I did and ended up buying it later. It got dropped off on my porch and i almost passed out running to the front door. I bring it inside, I sit it down and just stared at the box for like 17 minutes. One of the kids asked if they could open it and i hissed at them. I was in ""mine"" mode.I finally took it out the box and tried it. I was throwing EVERYTHING in the floor. I looked forward to messes and couldnt wait to be like ""dont worry i got this"" with my super mom cape on flowing in the background.  It literally gets up everything. The bottom of my kids feet stay cleaner than ever with less effort. Also forgot to mention the thing talks to you!  This Cleaner (I call her Tine'... pronounced Tin_eee) have been going strong for about 2 months now. I even gave her a necklace after our first date. Im in love with this girl and we will NEVER be apart (until the warranty wears out but you get my drift)Ill never go back to that old stick in the mud called ""Mop"" again.",
adams_marion,5.0 out of 5 stars,A awesome cleaner,the United States,16-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I feel like cleaning has become much easier since I bought this machine. The floor is much cleaner ,and the machine moves on by itself. It saves a lot of energy . The spot that I try to erase had been easily removed by this machine which is awesome .The most amazing thing about this floor cleaner is that no matter how much hairs is on the floor. They don't get tangled up in the rolling brush. You put the cleaner inside the stand ,its will start cleaning itself so you don‚Äôt need it to clean it.Also you can download the app to check if the cleaner is normal and have any problems.It can change the model of machine.The only thing bad about it is that the cleaner can't reach under a high-legged bed or sofa yet. However, the robot that I used to use at home, now have been replaced with this one . I sincerely recommend that this product is really easy to use.",

It‚Äôs so light, easy to maintain, and cleans VERY well. I ordered 11/29 and finally received 12/22, definitely worth the wait!I love that I can just grab it from the dock, power on, clean my mess (crumbs and all!) and empty/clean the dirty water tank.

Picks up things just like a vacuum. We have seemingly clean floors that we keep up with. But looking at this water I was STUNNED. The self cleaning is amazing as well. I love that nothing pluging into the device yourself so you can just grab it and go. I was able to do our 4 bed/2 bath with 2 tanks of water and battery didn't die. Our living room has a large carpet so that was the only room I didn't do. The cleaner is very light scent but pleasant. The floors have a beautiful shine to them.

I like the voice activation & the self cleaning feature.

The suction power and maneuverability is strong for deep cleaning. It is a powerful machine and lightweight. I am extremely impressed with the performance.  I was amazed to see the dirt pulled out of my floors! Wow!  I generally hurt from back pain & arthritis after vacuuming & washing my floors but not with this vacuum - no pain at all.

Kaitie B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tineco One S3 VS Bissell Cross Wave Max,the United States,29-May-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I borrowed my friends Bissell Cross Wave Cordless Max for a couple months & the first time I had to use a manual mop after that, I immediately went to Amazon afterwards & bought the Tineco One S3. Lol we have LVP flooring throughout our whole house & only a couple of area rugs that‚Äôs why I decided to go with the Tineco. So for those of you trying to choose between the two, here are some things I like/dislike about both.Cross Wave likes: Does area rugs & hard flooringSelf cleaning & it is also easy to clean afterwardsDislikes: Have to hold trigger for water then release to dry areaI noticed when I turned it off there would be a lot of extra water on the floor so it made it difficult to clean my stairs, which are also LVPTineco likes: iLoop infrared sensorNot a trigger to release water then go over area to dry. It is also self propelled which is nice - Cross Wave is not, if that matters to youSelf cleaning & is also easy to clean afterwardsLED display screenWhen you lock the vacuum in the upright position, it stays on (goes into a sleep mode to reserve battery) but doesn‚Äôt keep running, then when you‚Äôre ready to vacuum again it starts right up. The Cross Wave will stay running in the upright positionI‚Äôve had the Tineco One S3 for a month now & I honestly haven‚Äôt discovered anything I don‚Äôt like about this machine! I will update my review if any negative aspects come along.I did not download the Bissell Cross Wave app when I borrowed my friends. I do have the Tineco app & it is easy to use & was easy to connect to WiFi. After I cleaned with both of these & after the floor was dry, I took a wet paper towel & rubbed it on the floor. The paper towel was more dirty after using the Cross Wave than it was the Tineco. Needless to say, if I had more area rugs, I think the Cross Wave would of been of better use to me, but ultimately Tineco works the best for our lifestyle & household needs. I hardly use my Dyson V11 on my LVP flooring now because with the Tineco‚Äôs dual functionality, it makes it so much more convenient & easy to use!",

So, it desires floors to be swept or vacuumed first for much cleaner look.2) Automatic wet mode on. It‚Äôd be nice if user gets to choose if they just want to vacuum the floor first before mopping.3) The blue to red indicator- Red means more dirt and more power required, but it hops to Red on the areas that were just mopped.",

I do have a extra large area of floor to clean and after unboxing, I set it all up and made sure I had a full charge to work with. After it was fully charged, I went to work! I was nervous, so I started in a smaller area of my home and went from there. I did have to empty and clean/refill tank with clean water and solution once again before I was finished with the entire floor....( again, LARGE area). But this wasn‚Äôt a big deal and I continued and finished. I made sure to turn all ceiling fans on to expedite the drying time.  I was very surprised to notice that there wasn‚Äôt much water left on my floor during the process. When all was completed I was literally on 1% battery life... but I made it! I put it on charge and went to inspect. I did the (white glove test) using a wet paper towel in my heaviest traffic area..(kitchen) and it was completely CLEAN!!! I am absolutely AMAZED!!!!  I did notice that there was a slight haze left on my floor but I expected that from previous reviews. Others stated they use water/vinegar solution and it works just as well but without the haze, so I may switch to that.  Overall, I highly recommend this vacuum for those that LOVE a nice clean floor!",11
Brandi Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy this now!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,the United States,23-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Love this! Saw it on tictok and tried to patiently wait for prime day and stalked this item for 2 days during that time to try and get a deal...I got one! üëç(its a lot for me to spend on appliance) but after trying it for the 1st time...I would have paid full price. It's amazing! I wish the water tanks were a little bigger and maybe an option to switch out the rollers that have different roller textures for different messes but over all great product! I squealed like a little girl the 1st time I pushed the self cleaning button. üòÇ,
Mariah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,22-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I bought the Tineco iFloor because I saw many comparisons of it with the Bissell Crosswave on tiktok. The tineco iFloor cleans my floors easily; both washing and vacuuming at once. There are a few streak marks, but I‚Äôll take that over putting a lot of elbow grease into a swiffer sweeper! I wish the buckets/containers that hold the clean water and the dirty water were a little bigger so I wouldn‚Äôt have to dump them out/refill them as often but that‚Äôs about my only complaint. Great product, great suction power, cleans a bunch of muddy paw prints and dog hair on the daily. Still going strong!",One
Alice J,5.0 out of 5 stars,A amazing machine,the United States,26-Aug-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I bought an electric mop before ,but I had to clean the floor of my house every time before mopping the floor , so I bought this machine again , and I quickly install it according to the instructions after receiving the machine . it's very convenient . never sweep the floor anymore .you can directly use this mop to sweep and mop the floor.  girls always lose their hair .this one can clean up even the hair ,and it is equipped with the function of washing the mop .I love it .it saves me a lot of time in housework.",
Lori G,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG where have you been all my life??,the United States,17-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Best purchase in a long time.  In the last month we finished our remodel which now has most of our home covered in hard surface floors now, not to mention a new puppy which now means with the spring weather double the muddy floors.  I ordered the item below a week ago but was debating on sending it back because it was cordless which is great but it only holds a 25 minute charge and last time I did the floors on the main level it took me a couple hours with all the sweeping and mopping.  Well guess what with this machine I got all the floors done in less than 25 minutes and it was so darn easy.  It vacuums and mops at the same time so you only go over the floor once,  it uses minimal cleaner, floors are dry almost immediately, it is self propelled all you have to do is steer the thing and pull it back, and to top it all off the crazy product even cleans itself.  No cleaning pads needed, no cleaner to spray, no mop and bucket.  Worth every penny and such a time saver.",
Savanah D,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for dog hair,the United States,7-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,It‚Äôs okay but you‚Äôll need to vacuum before hand with a normal vacuum for dog hair as it pushes it around some,3
Ray L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly clean & easy to use!!!,the United States,27-Oct-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This is a lifesaver. I was very impressed when I used it the first time! It does the vacuum and mopping job at the same time; and I don‚Äôt need to sweep then mop. I am very picky on cleaning and details, but I am happy with this machine. With a baby and a dog in the house, keeping the floor clean and no dust is on my everyday to-do list. I specially like the self-clean feature on this machine. The roller can be took out and cleaned easily.I was hesitated on price but I find it worth the money after using it a few times. It saves me a lot of time on cleaning everyday.",
Becky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use very good vacuum,the United States,29-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Honestly been searching for a good home vacuum for a while. My old vacuum broke and been the hunt for something that‚Äôs ‚Äúworks, convenient, and more importantly, affordable.‚Äù This vacuum is different from the others I have used, slim, lightweight, and portable in comparison to other vacuums.-Easy assembly and processingCONS:-The price is not the most affordable option (but I think it‚Äôs the well worth price for its versatility and function).Overall happy with this purchase, had been using the vacuum for a little while now and have not had any issues, very satisfied, very satisfied.",
Lex,5.0 out of 5 stars,GAME CHANGER,the United States,18-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Love this wet dry vacuum! I have wood flooring in the living room seems like they may have been the original floors that came with the house. Most of them have pretty good spaces between each piece so even with sweeping or swiffering the floor just wasn't clean enough. Once I started using this vacuum so much dirt was lifted from the spaces between the wood. I can't imagine going back to just sweeping and swiffering. It is a little tedious with cleaning. With just my living room I have to clean out the tank at least once before finishing. However it is a small price to pay for cleaner floors!,
Lauren ,5.0 out of 5 stars,A mom‚Äôs best friend!!!,the United States,31-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"As ironic as it is, I found this vacuum because of Tik Tok and wow am I glad I did!!! We have all hard wood floors, and I was always trying to get a good vacuum or swiffer and then would have to go through with the bona to mop. But I never felt like I was getting a good clean! One swipe with the tineco and I knew that was true, what I saw in the dirty water tank was enough to make me want to ü§¢I love how easy it is to operate, how clean it gets my floors, and the self clean function is amazing! I finish mopping, pop it on the charger, hit the clean button and walk away to chase after the kids. I wish I found this sooner!! I really don‚Äôt have any complaints. Our house is on the smaller side, 1500 square feet so I‚ÄômAble to do the whole house on one charge but I do need to stop and empty the dirty water tank which isn‚Äôt that big of a deal or sometimes refill my clean water tank. It usually picks everything up in one swipe, unless of course the kids snacks have been there for a while which lets be honest, that happens more than we would all like‚Ä¶ GET THIS VACUUM YOU WONT REGRET IT!",
xy,5.0 out of 5 stars,A perfect machine for hardwood floors,the United States,29-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"This lightweight machine does everything we need for cleaning the hardwood floor throughout the house. It can automatically detect the dirt level and adjust the suction power. It also cleans itself, which is super helpful I don't have to rinse and clean. Look at how much dirt is lifted from a seemly clean floor. I also like the audio feedback on the machine status, when I need to fill the water tank and when I have to empty the dirty water tank. The app is also helpful!I really enjoy walking barefooted on the impeccable clean floor from this great machine!",

Sierra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What are you waiting for, you NEED this...like now!",the United States,16-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"Absolutely the greatest thing ever. Cuts my cleaning time down significantly. The best purchase I have made! It is great for cleaning daily messes on the floor. We have all hardwood and a toddler so I needed something to simplify cleaning the floors. It takes forever sweeping it all then mopping all of it with a regular mop and broom. However, that still needs to be done because this is more of a clean up daily messes instead of a deep cleaning machine. It works great, but you will still want to sweep and mop occasionally.",One
Malorie,3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs amazing but time consuming,the United States,8-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love the idea of this however, it stops me frequently to have it clean itself. So that‚Äôs where I decided to return it. It is frustrating to stop 5-10 minutes in between cleaning to have it clean itself for another 5-8 minutes and then charge a little longer. Not to mention clean the container. So all that to say, it‚Äôs not worth $230 for all of the maintenance extra required.",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Saver,the United States,18-Dec-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"This machine has saved me so much time within just the few months I have had it. We have 3 Labrador Retrievers in each color (blonde, chocolate & black!) So you can only imagine the dog hair and muddy paw prints in our house as our back yard in the winter is muddy and wet. This is good for deeps cleans & quick cleans ups when they come in muddy! My only complaint is the dog hair gets clogged sometimes. When I take the roller cover off to clean the hair is backed up in that section from where it gets clogged in the dirty water canister. Over all, it's worth it because it saves me so much time! We have a 1600 sqft house and I can clean the whole house on the same charge. (I move room to room) Suction works great it will pick up just about anything!",
Sara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love!!!!",the United States,6-Sep-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,After owning a Bissel cross way that loads suction and quit working I was leary to order this. But after so many friends suggested it I decided to give it a try. Might be my favorite cleaning device I‚Äôve ever owned. Cleans so quickly and efficiently I recommend it to everyone one. Only downside is the tank is a little small. It makes it easier to spot clean that way though. Love that it lets me know when the floor is clean.,
Rich,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome cleaner,the United States,8-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I bought this product a week ago and sart using it right away. It was amazing that cleaning becomes much easier for me when using it. The machine can move forward and save me a lot of effort. My floor becomes really clean and children feet keep clean after playing on it the whole day. The water in the dirty water tank becomes black and I never find my floor can be such clean before. It is very powerful with self cleaning mode and I don‚Äôt need to touch anything and it can be used for the next time. It doesn‚Äôt leave any streaks like a normal mop and extremely easy to use. Previously I cleaned my hardwood floor every two weeks, but now I would like to use it every other day since cleaning becomes such easy by using Tineco floor one S3! The solution smells very good as well. The battery last long and after I clean my living room, kitchen, bedroom I can still have 40% of battery. It is very impressive with the product and I love it so much!",

I have 2 dogs who shed NONSTOP (or so it seems). I've only used this a few times but the suction is great for my floors, its Very quiet on the auto setting, it maneuvers well. The only thing it's it doesn't get into 90degree corners as well as I hoped.Other wise its so fun to use and SUPER easy!Well worth the money",

I have three kids and they make such a mess! Thanks to this machine, I no longer have to separately sweep, vacuum, and mop! This cleaner has the ability to mop and vacuum at the exact same time! I was able to do all my wood floors in my house in 30 minutes and it still had power! The coolest feature, has to be the app that was so easy to connect and use. It reminds me when I need to do maintenance on the machine! Plus it has voice assistance! I no longer need to use my old vacuum because I have this. It has a self docking station where it not only charges itself, but has a built in self cleaning system! It came with a thing of cleaning solution as well!",

The cleaning solution has a very light clean scent and will last a LONG time as you only need a cap full. I have a husky mix who sheds like it is his job, this did a pretty good job getting all the hair. I will say, if it is up against a lot of hair, it will require a self-clean pretty early into your cleaning which is the ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars. I cannot believe I waited as long as I did to purchase this item!",One
Cristina Ellis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,the United States,8-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,I LOVE this vacuum. It‚Äôs perfect for my needs. I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old so meal time can be a mess. It keeps me from having to sweep then mop. It‚Äôs all in one! We do not wear shoes in the house and I‚Äôm super particular about keeping my house clean. This is what it picked up after one use!! I was shocked! I sweep daily and wipe up any mess as it‚Äôs made. The cleaner it comes with smells amazing! I‚Äôm super picky about scents. It‚Äôs not overwhelming and just smells fresh and clean. There‚Äôs no residue and makes my floors feel great. I cannot recommend this product enough!! I would also like to mention that I did buy the bissell crosswave originally but returned it bc I was not happy with the results. This one works so much better! I‚Äôm not one to write reviews but I definitely read them so I thought this one definitely deserved the recognition!,
D.

The battery power is sufficient but I do not think it will last for long periods however this is called out in the description.  It comes with nice extra items and is a quality piece for the cost.  I would give it a five start rating if the battery power was greater, the suction was a little better and the price was more reasonable (<$300 USD).",
KAK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Big test right off the bat, I'm impressed",the United States,27-Mar-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"So got this a few days ago but finally had the opportunity to try it after my 3 year old puked all over the kitchen floor. Bought it specifically for such occasions and was extremely impressed. It sucked everything right back up, easy to clean, and I ran it over the floor then cleaned the machine out then ran over the floor again it was super clean and smelled good. The solution should last a long time since it only takes a capfull at a time, no sticky residue at all after like how swiffer pads leave and it was worth the money just for the fact I didn't have to get down on hands and knees to clean up smelly vomit. Will update if anything changes but for sure excited about using it.",

The dog runs in the house with muddy paws with the husband running after with muddy boots and the baby just threw his food all over the floor! NO PROBLEM! This vac will get it all and with such ease!

It does a great job cleaning up whatever random sticky things my kids spill on the floor. However, my one HUGE complaint is, you have to refill and empty the water tanks quite frequently. I get that it needs to be light weight, but larger water tanks are really a must if you are doing anymore than a small kitchen. I can only get maybe halfway through a room before the clean water tank is empty. Otherwise a fantastic product.",One

Alejandro,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mother approved,the United States,4-Aug-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Love this tenico so much so I got one for my mom and she loved it. The only thing I think could be improved is the battery life other then that it's a great tool for the house.  I even mopped the house then used the vacuum and you still see the grime come up. I couldn't recommend this enough,
MRetzlaff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everyday messes are a breeze,the United States,28-Feb-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"GREAT suction, cleans really well but for my deep cleaning I prefer something more hands on than I‚Äôve found in a mop.

Shauna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes for a quick cleanup!,the United States,11-Nov-20,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,Cleans messes quickly with no leftover residue.  Fast drying as the first flooring cleaned is dry by the time I‚Äôm done at the other side.  Best feature is the self cleaning function.  No more touching nasty mop heads to wring out!  Just dump and rinse the tank.One drawback is the box is shipped without a shipping or corrugated box.  Bought another as a gift for my daughter and she saw it on the porch after delivery.  At least Christmas is a little over a month away so she won‚Äôt have to wait long!,

Evelyn Sosa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tineco works for me.,the United States,27-Jul-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,This works great for me. I have a dog that sheds frequently and this picks up all the dog hair right up! I can walk around barefoot and you can just feel the floor is clean. Never going back to sweeping and mopping the regular way. Saves me time too! Recommend 10/10. (Only downside if you have large space to vacuum you‚Äôll be having to dump out dirty water tank a bit frequently and perhaps refilling the clean water tank),

Chelsea,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase for my house!,the United States,21-Apr-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,This makes cleaning sooo easy. I think for a deep clean you should use another method. but for maintaining clean floors and just picking up every so often this is very good,

Maria,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good, just a few things",the United States,23-Feb-21,Color: Ifloor3,Verified Purchase,"I was expecting it to be a lot better based in the reviews and videos I‚Äôve seen of it, but maybe it‚Äôs just my floor. It sometimes leaves little water spots on the floor and occasionally I can see streaks. When you take the clean water tank out it drips a little on the floor and that‚Äôs annoying too. But it‚Äôs light weight and seems to be doing a great job at cleaning since the water is so nasty. Maybe not so much a good deep cleaner.",
Channing,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,the United States,28-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I can't begin to write enough about this thing...

My husband was not a believer until her did the paper towel test and came up with a completely clean paper towel.

I researched for months on which brand to choose and overall the Tineco seemed to have the best performance.  It is so easy to use and not bulky so I can store and it‚Äôs not an eye sore.  Very light and it pulls itself forward so even more manageable. Cleans quickly so I haven‚Äôt even used up the battery life once while operating it.

Victoria Hull,1.0 out of 5 stars,Be aware-you might be getting a used vacuum.,the United States,23-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,I am extremely disappointed.. I researched so hard before buying and waited for weeks for the vacuum to arrive. Once it did and i started opening it I knew something was wrong. You could hear the parts move around loosely. When I opened the box it smelled like wet dog. There was also a fake flower packed in the vacuum box not the amazon box. As you can see in the pictures the water tank was still wet. The lower portion had hair and dirt in it and that is what smelled so bad. There was no cleaner solution in the box when there should have been. The old tags were cut out off of the box. I received a used vacuum and I was so mad because I spent a good chunk of change and waited so long for it to arrive. I heard so many good reviews of it and am still excited to try it out but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll buy another one. It is hard knowing this came directly from the company.,6

M. Valuckas,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ok little cleaner but has limitations,the United States,15-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Update after several months of use.  I really liked this machine in the beginning but now I realize for the price, it‚Äôs a ripoff.  Major issues, the vacuum is basically for just things left over after you did a formal vacuum or if you use it every single day.  Don‚Äôt expect this to do anywhere near the job of a real vacuum.  There is ZERO edge cleaning by the vacuum or the mop function.  None.  There is no way to get to the areas where everything gets pushed like along walls or cabinets.  The electronic connection to my phone‚Ä¶useless.  Paid extra for that and it doesn‚Äôt even connect anymore nor was that function worth it anyway.  The tanks‚Ä¶way way way too small.  Here is where the biggest problem pops up. If anything is even remotely stuck down or older dirt it won‚Äôt clean it up or if it does, it‚Äôs only in the high dirt mode that goes through some serious water.  They have no abrasive brush for tile‚Ä¶just the soft brush better for real wood floors.  Nothing with some actual cleaning ability.  This means to do 500 square feet of floor that‚Äôs a little more dirty (say 3-4 days of kids and dogs but nothing horrid) I go through 3 tanks of water to clean the floors and the machine.  That means I have to dump the dirty water tank out 3-4 times over 15-20 minutes.  Insane.  While this does sorta clean‚Ä¶.for the price it was a huge waste of money.  So disappointed I spent so much money.  I hear they are correcting some of these things in the newer models but I‚Äôm still out over $400 for a machine that doesn‚Äôt clean.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this little thing but there are limitations in a big way.Pros:Great for fast cleanups of dry/wet combo messes.Does a good job to ‚Äútidy‚Äù up a floor with a quick vacuum and fast wash.Easy to use.Self cleans much of itself.Battery is more than sufficient for a single medium sized house floor.Doesn‚Äôt leave floors soaked so they dry quick.Gets into most small spaces.Perfect for clearing getting up dust.Relatively quiet compared to a full vacuum.Cons:Can‚Äôt get up even a little dried mud or food.  Because it puts down very little water, dried anything even at max power isn‚Äôt coming up.  Wet mud from puppy paws yes!  They need to offer a brush with slightly stiffer padding or a pre-soak option.Vacuum is weak.  It‚Äôs not going to get much up against baseboards.  Dry items like scraps of paper just get stuck to the floor from getting wet.Both the dirty and clean water tanks are crazy small and need to be refilled/emptied multiple times during use.The fancy electronic version is MAJOR overkill.  Not needed or worth the money.  I don‚Äôt need a text to my phone saying the clean water tank is empty when the vacuum is verbally telling me that same thing.The self cleaning cycle doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt need to manually clean out the dirty tank with all the vacuumed stuff floating in the dirty water or remove the brush and clean it.  Don‚Äôt do that and things will smell.  It just makes cleaning things a little faster.If you have a large floor or multiple floors, you have to wait hours for a recharge.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong.  I don‚Äôt regret this purchase (well other than the electronic upgrade part).  This is wonderful for when kids run inside with stuff on their shoes or pups run in with muddy feet.  It‚Äôs perfect for a quick clean of the floors before guests arrive or just in the middle of the day.  It will be amazing on my new lvp floors in the basement.  I just still have to do a better job vacuuming regularly with a full vacuum and deep clean the floors for stuck on items.  It‚Äôs my cleaner for fast jobs and maintenance cleaning but not deep cleaning.",One

Just not worth it like I thought. Cleaning awesome, but being cordless and only having about 35 minutes of cleaning‚Ä¶ just is not what I‚Äôm looking for.I have 10 dogs, and so the amount of dirt and mud they bring in, plus the random mess... I have never been soo happy to have a vacuum! It saves so much time and money. Instead of having to do a three step process: sweep, vacuum, and mopping. To do it with just one thing... I will definitely be buying again for the rest of my life! The down side of it is the battery life, and how long it takes to charge. But how good it works, I can look past the lack of time the battery can last before being put back on charge. Nice not having my back hurt from mopping and sweeping, just one fluid motion! The tougher stains go over slowly. It pulls up everything!",One

R.C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Made Cleaning Way Easier,the United States,1-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I bought this machine to replace mopping, and so far I love this product.Comparing to mopping, this is definitely way cleaner and less efforts. Unless you keep changing your mopping water, normal mopping will just gonna spread dirty water all over the floor, in another hand, this product sprays out clean water as it goes, and the dirty water it sucks up will surprise you.My arm did get a little tired after using it, as it does have some weights, but still way less tired than normal mopping. Time saver too. It said only to use their cleaner solution, and I think the cleaner cleans well, smells refreshing, I like it‚Äôs also pet and children safe.As you can see in my video, some tougher spots need to go over a couple or even a few times to completely get rid of it. I recommend going parallel with your flooring if you have vinyls like mine, because going perpendicular will make the cleaner harder to suck up dirty water.I took one star off because the tank is a bit small, you do need to refill a few times if you have a bigger house.I recommend doing self cleaning after each use, basically it washes the roller for you. I also recommend rinsing the compartments with cold water to make sure no debris are left. I air dry all the parts on a towel (see picture). This is the best way to keep your machine clean.Overall I think the price is reasonable. Although some improvements can be made, I still think this is a great cleaning product to save time and energy. Would recommend buying.",One

Only thing I would have liked better for the price. Is if the mop head was more heavy  duty, or you got two mop heads. For some areas that I missed prior and they are dried on it a little harder to get with this mop head. Maybe a future add on item?  pretty upset, I just got my mop 3 days ago.

Melissa K,1.0 out of 5 stars,From 5 to 1 star!,the United States,17-Dec-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE: So I‚Äôve had this 400$ vacuum for about a month now and have used about 10 times. I originally loved this vacuum but have already started having problems and customer service is terrible. I sent them an inquiry and it took them two weeks to get back to me. I wrote them back and then it took another two weeks for me to get a response. By the time you‚Äôre starting to get to any kind of resolution the return period is over. (which I have yet to get any kind of resolution) They just keep asking me to check things that are common sense like I don‚Äôt know how to use the vacuum.Anyway, so here are the problems I‚Äôve started having. From day one the vacuum leaves a small puddle after I turn it off. I am almost positive it‚Äôs coming from the dirty water tank because when I wipe it up it is not clean water. Then, about the seventh or eighth time I used it I noticed a knocking sound. It seriously sounds like a car that the motor is about to go. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs whats wrong with the vacuum because I have no idea, but it sounds terrible. And just yesterday it started telling me I needed to refill my clean water tank even though my clean water tank was full. This thing is already bossy enough so I really don‚Äôt appreciate it telling me I need a refill my clean water tank over and over when it‚Äôs already full. Keep in mind I‚Äôve had this for about a month and already have had those problems. Like I said that‚Äôs not even the worst part. I‚Äôm big on customer service and I don‚Äôt think Tineco‚Äôs customer service is up to par. I am incredibly disappointed because there was so much hype around this vacuum and I was so excited to get it. And honestly, I truly loved it at first but something that cost this much should not have this many issues within the first month. So disappointed.I have attached a video. In the beginning of the video it showing the clean water tank and it‚Äôs full. Then I turn the vacuum on and it starts telling me I need to put some water in cleaning solution in my clean water tank. If you listen very closely (especially when the vacuum noise goes down and it starts talking) you will hear the knocking sound I‚Äôm talking about.I think it was hyped up too much and my expectations were too highFirst, I want to say that I consider myself an expert in the floor cleaning tool industry. My Family tells me I have an addiction to vacuums and mops . Honestly this is because I have two dogs and three cats and an eight-month-old grandbaby that is over here constantly. If I clean my floors, 30 minutes later there is dog hair all over them. I wanted something that was super easy and convenient and possibly help me throw all my old tools away.I want to say that this is really a wonderful product. However, after seeing it posted all over Facebook and tick-tock, I thought I would be able to throw out all of my other mops and vacuums. Unfortunately, that isn‚Äôt the case. As far as doing the job that it claims, I think it does that and does a great job at it. It picks up the pet hair like there isn‚Äôt any tomorrow and I don‚Äôt think my floor has ever been cleaner. However, it‚Äôs not perfect by any means. Here‚Äôs what I have noticed. As I said, it is wonderful at cleaning up animal hair and small things but sometimes on the bigger items  it just kind of pushes them around or wants to spit them out. This honestly isn‚Äôt a huge deal for me at all sense i usually don‚Äôt have a lot of big things like that on my floor. it‚Äôs mostly just hair, and a lot of it. Next, starting the vacuum and stopping the vacuum there is always a small puddle of water that I have to end up getting a rag to clean up. It also drips  from the tanks sometimes. Finally, The self-cleaning mode is good. However, I still have to pull the cover off and remove hair from the brush in the compartment every time. This could be just because we have SO much animal hair in my house.This is the other thing. I thought this was going to be super easy. Something that I could have prepared and pull out anytime of the day to clean up small messes at any point in time. Unfortunately, that is still a job for my wet jet or my Dyson. Every time you use this, you have to take the tanks out (along with the filter) and then remove the roller brush and let it all dry out. So it‚Äôs not one and done you can just get it out use it and set it back up. There is a process to it. It‚Äôs not hard by any means, but a process nevertheless.The only other negative is something that I have seen on a few reviews. The water tanks are extremely small. I have to change them out probably every 10 minutes or less. Then, the battery life is subpar.With all that being said, my floors have never been cleaner. It really does a wonderful job mopping and getting up small things like hair, dust, and debris. I have a horrible back, with any other mopping product that I have tried I tend to push down the entire time regardless if I need to or not, trying to get the floors as clean as I can. I don‚Äôt feel the need to do that with this. It also has the self propel which works really well, actually. So it really does help your back. I kinda enjoy using it (as much as a person can enjoy vacuuming/mopping that is.)Overall, its a really good product that has some small flaws and room for improvement. It‚Äôs just not the one and done, end all be all that it‚Äôs been made out to be. I will still pull out easier to use units that doesn‚Äôt have any kind of process the majority of the time (Swiffer, wet jet, Roomba, dyson.) This will be used two or three times a week for my clean the whole house type of thing.Sorry for such a long review but since this has a hefty price tag I wanted to take the time and really give all the pros and cons that I came up with.",

Great suction power and pick up ability! My floors look awesome in half the time versus sweeping and mopping! I love my new vacmop! It can vacuum and mop the floor at the same time and it does both very effectively. I live in a home complete with hardwood floors. I have two sons, they are very naughty and often dirty the floor when eating. I've saved so much time cleaning thanks to this Tineco. It does a lot better job than I do sweeping. The perfect 2 in 1 for my hardwood floors. Especially in my kitchen. Vacuum the crumbs and mop up the liquid spills. This is one of the best purchases I've made. Really happy with this and highly recommend.",

It can be very convenient to clean and wash the floor. The only drawback is that the head of the machine is heavy, so it is easy to hit corn or a wall.  Except for this point, it is perfect.

Bendy (Ben and Randy),4.0 out of 5 stars,Must have for pets!,the United States,30-Mar-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"We have had a lot of fun using this machine recently and have been shocked at the things it‚Äôs pulled up from our house. We definitely didn‚Äôt mop quite as frequently as we probably should have before, this has made things so easy, it‚Äôs hard NOT to use it!We have 2 dogs (20 & 45 lbs), 3 cats, & 3 adults living in the same house. We have a Roomba device that runs 3x/week, but that only helps with the hair‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs spring, meaning the muddy footprint season has started.Our entire first level is all hard wood and we haven‚Äôt found the perfect area rug yet, so this machine is made just for us. We used it the first time & to say the stuff that came up from the floor is an understatement. We ended up taking our time and got 2 full dirty canisters that we‚Äôre so filthy it fully shocked us.This not only cleaned up the hair, but got rid of the footprints perfectly. We‚Äôve now used this two weeks in a row and the second time was just as impressive as the first.Everything was easy to clean afterwards, and easy to dismantle. The cleaning solution smells good in the container, and did an ok job of deodorizing, but I would have liked there to be a more lasting/stronger smell in the concentrate. After cleaning there really isn‚Äôt amy noticeably clean smell, which is disappointing. It also seems like the solution is backordered, which TBH isn‚Äôt acceptable if they expect you to only use their solution. They definitely should give recommendations if they can‚Äôt keep stock.I removed one star for the relatively large strip of the roller brush/machine that doesn‚Äôt get clean near any walls/obstacles. Each side of the roller brush has a 2‚Äù+ strip that doesn‚Äôt get scrubbed regardless of how you attack the area. This said, it still has good suction for the pet hair, so it at least gets the hair even if it doesn‚Äôt scrub it actively.All in all we‚Äôre very happy with the quality of cleaning, and very happy about runtime. It‚Äôs able to clean the entire house with one charge and have some left over. The ‚Äúclean detector‚Äù I‚Äôm mixed with because it‚Äôs flagged a few areas and there‚Äôs no extra visible dirt, and those areas that are visibly dirtier didn‚Äôt flag the sensors at all. I think it‚Äôs a made up thing, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt anything I suppose.The machine auto-cleaning works AMAZINGLY well. It not only cleans the brush head exceptionally well, it also dries it really well. I didn‚Äôt trust it the first time I used it, so I tried washing it by hand afterwards, which was pointless - the water was amazingly clear, and by the time I was done the brush head was way more wet than when I removed it. This said, it DOES NOT remove ALL of the hair from the machine, and you need to expect to clean the machine by hand more if you pull up any kitty litter. This isn‚Äôt a deal breaker, but something to be aware of - you need to take the roller brush off and clean behind it between every complete cleaning cycle.Impressed but not without issues.",One

Demin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life saver, my Best Buy in 2020 or ever",Canada,6-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,This is absolutely a life saver.

I hate a dirty floor while I don‚Äôt have the time to do the job and this is a big headache. I got the recommendation from my friend and I bought it the night she told me about it. I loved it the moment I started to use it. I love the idea that you can vacuum and mop your floor at the same time. I love it that it can completely clean my bathroom floor with cat litters everywhere with just one walk. I love the idea that the clean roller can be self cleaned thoroughly without touching it. Floor cleaning has never been so easy and delightful.  I would like to recommend it to everyone that I know!,14
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.,Canada,8-Oct-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Day 1:Installation is easier than I thought but do take 2-5min to real manuals though.As long as we are not making a huge mess after months of abuse, the Floor One S3 is doing a great job. I have been using it on both laminated floor and concrete floors. It does pickup hair, and not tangle itself easily. All mess including hair was sucked into the dirty water tank.The all-in-one has two advantage over the normal vacuum :-- Wetting the hair so that suction could be easier. For really stinky stuff like bubble gem or glue it certainly won't clean.  But for other greasy spot it works like a charm.-- No dust no re-pollution.It does have self cleaning function which are pretty effective for cleaning the brush and drain system. And YES you do have a function to clean without the solution. Also the solution bottle is generous giving you around 40 times usage.Cleaning the tanks and accessory is not as complicated as I thought. Probably 1-2min rinse thing.A bit of drawback is the clean water tank is a bit small. For bigger homes, you are looking for 2-3 rounds. Also charging time is slow....",7
XIAOCHENG MAI,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this convenient technology.,Canada,13-Nov-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Very convenient. Strongly recommend if you have kids at home!!!!Pros:1. Bought on Amazon prime day event with very good deal.2. WiFi connected, so i can monitor its condition with my phone.Ôºàpower conditions/self clean etc)3. Wash floor and clean dust. I'm satisfied with its results. Better than using swiffer sweeper. It can lead you go, so you don't feel any tired using it. Make me happy to see the floor changed to be clean easily after my 2 children's dining.4. Material is very think and nice looking.5. Sucking dust function is very strong.Cons:1. You need to wash the dirty water tank everyday to keep it from yucky smelling because food rest,dust  and hairs mix all together inside. Better to wash with some dettol liquid (or other kind liquid kills germs).2. After using it, remember to open its head remove the roller, use paper to wipe out the dirty things sticks on the edge near the roller.All in all, i enjoy using it everyday.  Very easy to handle.",8
Jo,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Software issues; ""iLoop dirt sensor"" doesn't work.",Canada,5-Dec-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this vacuum, but unfortunately, it's just a very expensive, glitchy OKAY.The machine is supposed to be ""smart"" and tell you when the dirty water tank is full or when the clean water tank is empty. This it does...defectively. The signal lights don't turn off once the issue's been addressed, which prevents the machine from starting back up again. I then have to power off and power back on before it comes to its senses.Secondly, I've used two of these iFloor S3 vacuums now (my sis has one), but the iLoop sensor doesn't actually work. For the first 20 minutes of vacuuming, the sensor was continually fully blue, even as I vacuumed the dirtiest part of my house. For the last 10 minutes of vacuuming, the sensor suddenly started detecting ""dirt"" when I was making extra passes over a very clean floor I had already vacuumed.¬†Using my sister's vacuum, the iLoop would randomly ""detect dirt"".It's not all bad though. I like that the vacuum doesn't leave a lot of water on the floor and the water dries pretty quickly. The vacuum is slightly self-propelled which means you don't have to push - you only have to pull. It seems to do a fairly good job of giving the floor a ""quick mop"". Any dried-on drips need several passes to get off, but I haven't tried it on anything super sticky. It definitely is less effort than a traditional mop, but at 30x the price of a mop......I'm not sure.I want to love this vacuum,¬†but I am very concerned with the presence of such technical issues in¬†a brand new unit at this price point.They sent a replacement machine under warranty, but it continues to have the same issues.",3
Jonathan Mintak,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Vacuum I have bought,Canada,27-Sep-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"The suction power is incredible for getting all small debris, even the tough bits get taken right on.Our house had ash thrown onto a carpet, I used this before using a carpet cleaner and this pretty much had the carpet looking identical to when it was brand new.5/5",6
SCOTT CRUMLY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning power.,Canada,16-Jul-21,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,"Does a surprisingly good job cleaning the floors. A little gauge lights up red on sticky areas so you can go over a few times until it fades blue again. It didn't seem to notice small dried on liquids, so I think it must decide what's dirty based on if the roller feels resistance.The water that you pour out is so dirty it's embarrassing. But that's how clean it gets. When the brush gets dirty it tells you to go run the cleaning mode on the charging base.The self cleaning mode is pretty nice. Last time I used it it took almost a full tank of water to clean the brush roller, the dirty water just for cleaning the brush was embarrassing again. I thought with the roller brush that dirty, the last parts of flooring that I washed would turn out to be dirty still, but they were perfect.I am using this on regular laminate floor, which soaks up and swells if you don't clean up any spills, so I was nervous to try this product on the floor, but multiple uses so far and it's perfect. I think it even cleans the cracks between the planks a little bit, not sure though.After you are done using it, and done the self clean cycle, you need to pull the dirty tank out, take out the plastic top that holds the filter for the vacuum, and rinse everything off, then set the filter and the roller brush onto the spots for them on the charging base to dry out, so it's a little more work after you're done than just throwing microfiber pads in the washing machine, but this machine gets the floors cleaner than microfiber pads do.Very happy with this, used it three times do far.",

It‚Äôs much easier to use this than to vacuum and then mop. It also great for accidental spillage, use the vacuum to pick it up, run the clean cycle and then return to the site for another pass. You‚Äôre supposed to take out the roller to let it dry, but I use the vacuum more than once a day, and I don‚Äôt find a need switch it out. I said I use it more than once a day, so the refill tank has to be refilled once per day as well, that‚Äôs because I run the clean cycle after each use.  I find that dog hairs like to stick to it so you have to address that, rinse the roller cover, there is a rubber strip that collects hair and also underneath the vacuum. So yeah! More maintenance is required than the mop and bucket, but you still won‚Äôt regret it.",One

Truth be told I have not used it to clean up the kind of spills that they show it can, but I love that it vacuums up what I have missed with the broom. Note...I didn't buy it to clean up spills or replace my broom. I bought it to get clean floors and to vacuum up the stray pet hairs and it does both very well.

Terra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase made,Canada,12-Dec-20,Color: Floor One S3,Verified Purchase,This floor cleaner is life changing. It will clean your floors brand new. I had cleaners on Friday that has mopped my floor and this arrived on Monday and the water tank was black from cleaning the floors. The difference is life changing and also it cuts your cleaning time in half. My floors are uneven hardwood and I previously owned the Bissel crosswave which would just skimp over the unevenness and not clean the floor. This however DOES work on non flat surfaces. The only problem is that ke doesn‚Äôt reach edges however the vacuum suction still works on the edges so I‚Äôm ok with that. Love this thing!,

Cleans really well and vacuum's at the same time (even better than I thought it would). You dont have to vacuum first, it does it all. We rarely use our vacuum on hard surfaces now this thing is so good. Floors sparkle.The machine also talks to you and tells you what needs to be done so there is no confusion whats needed if it stops working or needs something.One recommendation for future models would be a bigger clean and dirty water tank. We have a main floor around 2,000 sq ft and we need to change the dirty water tank at least 2x, maybe three. And the clean water typically needs to be refilled as well.",

lucky3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it!! *UPDATED EDIT*,the United States,10-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôm shocked at this wet/dry vac! 2300 sq ft house, done in 30 minutes. Changed water out once and it was filthy. It even self cleans the roller! The solution it came with works amazing. I bought this on a whim bc there was a $30 offer off. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs unavailable now, but once it‚Äôs back in stock- buy it!! I‚Äôm never this lucky with unknown brand items. Feels like I hit a jackpot here.UPDATE: It‚Äôs been about a month and I‚Äôm still in love with this vac. Working like a charm. I‚Äôve ran it over some rugs and they cleaned up great. I‚Äôm using Quick Shine Floor cleaner mixed with the water now and no problems (I have high-end laminate ‚Äúwood‚Äù floors and tile). I only use hot water on the rugs.Update: it‚Äôs been over a year and it‚Äôs is still going strong! My quick little mopper! Now I use a hot water and alcohol mix to clean with bc of Covid : ) I do a deep clean with a mop bucket and pine sol (when I deep clean) but this guy is my favorite daily mopper.","1,259"
SouthernBoy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quieter and Better Suction than it's Closest Competitor,the United States,24-Mar-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've had this for a few days now and it's my new favorite floor cleaner. I have sealed concrete floors in my condo and was tired of manually mopping. Made the mistake of getting the Bissell CrossWave Pet Pro (very loud! and heavy!), but then I noticed this appeared on Amazon a few days later as a new product. The ""Vacuum Wars"" guy on YouTube reviewed their regular vacuum cleaner (not this one) and he gave it an excellent score so I felt confident that this iFloor would be good as well. The Bissell has a cord and I hated that because it is a lot less convenient (will be returning the Bissell, but mainly because the Bissell is way too noisy). It's fairly quiet (significantly quieter than the Bissell) and the battery lasts a long time. I would say it lasts longer than what they say in their QA section of Amazon because I've not had to charge it yet and have used it a bunch of times. It must have been fully charged from the factory before they sent it. The suction is very good for a cordless vac. I actually took the front cover and roller off and turned it on to see how powerful it's suction is behind where the roller sits and it's pretty darn good! It's also lightweight and easy to maneuver. I've attached a photo of all the junk it picked up after a single filling of water (I have not used the solution they give you in the box yet, but it does say to just use one capful of the solution meaning that bottle will last a long time). My final decision on getting this was that it was much less expensive than the others out there and was cordless. I looked at the HIZERO at a local vacuum cleaner store and didn't like it because it felt like it was pulling me around and not letting me guide the floor cleaner (almost like it was suctioned to the floor) and was very expensive. I'm glad I got this iFloor instead because this thing is pretty amazing!!!",801
Sammy K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for kitchens and busy household!,the United States,23-Mar-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I don't normally write reviews for products but I was very impressed with this vacuum! It was very quick to setup. It took me less than 3 min to put it together. It came with a charged battery which was a nice touch. I put the cleaning solution in the tank with some warm water and was off and running. The vacuum is very quiet for all that it's doing. It has a liquid dispense mode as well as a turbo mode which were useful for getting some of the stuck on grim off of my kitchen floor. It was easily maneuverable and could get into all the tight little corners. When I was done the water in the waste tank was black so you could see that it really did remove a lot of grim from the floor. The scrubbing brush is also removable and separately cleanable which I did to make sure everything stays nice and clean. I placed the vacuum on the included drip tray to make sure that the vacuum didn't leave a puddle on the floor. The vacuum left my kitchen floor clean and shiny and I look forward to cleaning up the rest of my house with it. Overall, I'm very happy with this vacuum and would recommend it!",458
Becca B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who doesn't need more time?,the United States,27-Mar-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My decision to purchase the Tineco iFloor was made based on the fact that it vacuums and mops at the same time.  I never have enough hours in the day and sure don't want to spend any more time cleaning than necessary.  First, it was very simple to put together.  This is my first cordless and bagless vacuum/mop and those two features along with the light weight made me happy before I even turned it on.  Once I did turn it on and pushed it around, I saw the milk bone crumbs disappear and pushed the button to dispense the water and solution and it was simple and worked!  The handle to dispense the water and solution is in a convenient spot and makes it almost impossible to overspray as you easily can with a Swiffer Wet Jet.  The vacuum feature prevents that thin rim of dog hair/dirt at the edge of the baseboard that other mops can leave behind.  Because it dries within about 60 seconds, I can move my kitchen table and chairs over a few feet, mop the floor, and move them right back.  No more moving them into the hallway so I can do the whole floor and waiting for it to dry to move them back.  I did a two large rooms two small baths and a long L-shaped hallway and only used about half of the clean water tank.  This is probably more machine than I needed since my living room and bedrooms are carpeted, but I don't care.  It's worth it for the simplicity of doing the tile floors I do have and not having a backache at the end.  It's worth it for the fact that I got all of my floors done in 20 minutes and it usually takes just over an hour counting drying time and furniture replacement.  I was so impressed with what my iFloor did, I ordered the Tineco A10 Master Cordless Stick Vacuum.  It was also simple to put together and in just trying it out, not only did I like it, but was stunned at all the dirt that came up.  I plan to try it on  furniture and more thoroughly on my carpet, but I already think I will be as happy with that as I am with the iFloor.  Tineco has answered some questions I had and I can verify that their customer service is fast and courteous.  I usually try to deal with brand names that I know and trust and Tineco was new to me, but with their superior products and excellent customer service, I anticipate they will become a household name in the not too distant future.",425
Leslie,5.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATE Luv my scrubber. UPDATE I learned how to to turn it on. (Original: I‚Äôm Returning),the United States,12-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"6/6/2019 - Never been happier with my all in one.  It‚Äôs really been great. I never thought I would want to clean my floors so often, but this lil machine makes it so easy.Spills, dog haircuts, and after party cleanings are a breeze.  I use it on my carpet sometimes too. Shuuush.  Don‚Äôt judge me!The charge is actually pretty amazing. I can do 1200 square feet on regular mode and it doesn‚Äôt die.  The super sucker mode kills it fast tho, so do hard spots after you‚Äôve done the rest of the floors.It‚Äôs easy to clean and take apart too. My hair doesn‚Äôt get all crazy on the scrubber. I just cut once and pull it through.Thanks tenico for this gaget.  I‚Äôm changing this to five stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äî‚Äî-5/2/2019 UPDATED.....COULD USE BETTER DIRECTIONS TO USESo I learned I should just tap the on button and it runs just fine.  I tried that the first time and it wouldn't do anything. Holding it down puts in super sucker mode?? Dunno...it's not in the manual.It works normally now, but still is lacking getting edges and corners.  Not sure how to remedy that other than buying something else to do those.  Kind of a pain.  I bet all of these machines have that issue tho.Cleans well and the charge seems good.  I'm still a Tineco fan at this point. Customer service contacted me for my first bad review two days before my 30 day return option is up.  I didn't really need them at that point tho.  Still nice they reached out.  I'm going to give it a month or two and put another update in here.  4 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-It turns off after running for 1-2 minutes and I turn it back on.....and off and on .

Nanner,1.0 out of 5 stars,Trash. Dead after barely 2 years.,the United States,22-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE APRIL 2021: its dead and does not even power on. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. We suck at keeping up with moping and used it maaaybe once a week. Not worth it for $160.July 2019: I sat on the fence for probably 3 months trying to decide on a crosswave, which crosswave, or this version. Luckily the video from Vacuum Wars comparing the different models sold me (and the self cleaning feature)! And other Tineco products have good reviews from them as well. I got mine for $160 on PrimeDay. My photo is from my tile floor and ONLY using tap water...cause I'm a dummy and thought the purchase came with cleaning solution. Once you get past the fact a floor scrubber like this needs to be thoroughly cleaned EACH time it is used, it is soooooo worth it! I was pretty horrified at what ended up in the dirty water tank as we only used plain water and we only did the main traffic areas real quick. If you are on the fence, BUY THIS ONE! Though the manual does say there is no replacing the battery. When it's done, the WHOLE unit is done. Pretty wasteful....though I have no idea if that rings true for the bissell ones too?",264
Dayna,5.0 out of 5 stars,I heart this little tool...,the United States,8-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Other reviewers are correct, there are some issues and I will get to those, but I LOVE this purchase.  I use it every other day because I have a four year old messy boy and a four month old puppy.  This thing makes quick touch ups on our hardwoods a breeze.  We have not had any issues with streaking - while it is damp (just like a mop) after use... it hasn‚Äôt caused streaks for us when it dries.  The water tank does all the busy paths, but I have to refill it to clean my entire first floor.  It would be great if it was a little larger, but then it wouldn‚Äôt be as small and lightweight.  So, I am ok refilling it.It can leak (after cleaning especially) and I resolved that with a $8 boot tray.When you are finished using it, you need to run self clean (but you have to clean it first).  It‚Äôs a bit of a process, but easier than filling a mop bucket and bending / pushing for a hour.For me, it doesn‚Äôt replace mopping, but it sure extends it. After about 10 uses, I still adore this little machine.",151
Gadget,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gets all the Crumbs off the Tile!,the United States,14-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My house is about 1800 sq ft and most of it is tile.  I have tried numerous things to clean the floor with little success.  I use a dust mop to sweep up any debris/crumbs but inevitably, it doesn't get everything.  I use a Shark Stream Mop to mop the tile, but it doesn't pick up any leftover crumbs and just moves them around. My Dyson D25 doesn't not work well on tile and manual mopping just takes too long.I had been considering a Crosswave but saw this product.  The good reviews, smaller price tag and cordlessness made it ideal.After first use, I was happy to find that I could walk across the floor barefoot and not pick up any crumbs on the soles of my feet!  It did a great job of suctioning all the little bits of stuff left over from sweeping, especially around the baseboards.  The spot feature worked well on a coffee stain I found in the dining room.It is quiet, takes up little space and comes with a great base for storage and charging.  I used the self cleaning feature today and it worked great.  The machine is also easy to disasseble for cleaning (much better than my Bissell carpet cleaner).Only downside is that it won't pick up some stuck on debris on the floor (like candy).  Still definitely worth the price.",177
Mo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for small apartments!,the United States,20-May-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was looking to replace my Swifer wetjet with something that wasn't so manual, call me lazy but I hated having to scrub at the floor for small spills and messes... enter the Tineco iFloor Mop Vacuum! I've had it almost a week now and I've used it almost daily. It makes keeping my small apartment clean SO easy. I love that I can pop it off the charging dock and run it through the house, empty the water tank (incredibly satisfying to see all the dirty water in there btw), and then put it back on the charging dock. This lil floor cleaner is here to stay and I recommend this to any small apartment or homeowner, this paired with a good strong vacuum is all you need to keep your floors tidy and clean!",176
APF,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had it for a month and it stop WORKING- they change it and is the best,the United States,14-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bougth this Tineco iFloor Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner because I need to change the last Hoover FloorMate Cordless Hard Floor Cleaner i had, and even I had a good experience the HOVVER didnt last long, so I decide to pay a little more for a coordles machine and I decided tor the Tineco.I buyt it  July 16, 2019, and for a month work fine, its quiter than the hoover and its coordles, that was good, but it doesnt clean the spots as well as the Hoover, But I was happy about it.When a month passed the machine start working alone.... We had to let it finish the battery... and plug it agin, it never worked againt.....I contact Custumer service, made videos, photos and everything, and this is the time that I hadn't recived the shipping label  they promised on september 15.I'm very disapoined it I had high expectatives with this product.....Upgrade.They send me another totally free, and it work perfect.The battery works enougth for the house, and it helps me a lot with the pet hair.Update months later than the other one.Super super happy!It works great, battery stil working full capacity.UPDATE 2021!!!!It‚Äôs incredible it‚Äôs still working and went through the pandemia!

Abby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for parents who don‚Äôt have time to mop...or just hate mopping.,the United States,30-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely could not be happier with this purchase. For years I had wanted a two-in-one vacuum/mop combo but thought they were way too expensive (and actually still think they are too expensive). I would always tell myself I was going to get around to mopping, and to be honest I rarely did (and by rarely, I mean never). Finally, I gave in and decided to give it a shot based on the Amazon reviews, and it is incredible. If you‚Äôre a busy parent and have absolutely zero time, this is one tool you definitely need. It‚Äôs easy to use, easy to clean, cleaning solution smells good, and it is very lightweight. Sure, every once in a while I‚Äôll get a tiny water streak left on the floor...but its better than the alternative, which was total avoidance of mopping. Plus it does a really great job, the water is always disgusting with all kinds of crap in it when I finish. Honestly, I think this mob has really simplified my life, and saves me tons of time I would be wasting on mopping (in theory...in reality, my floors would just be filthy, I probably still wouldn't have gotten around to mopping).",104
Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Your floor cleaning struggles are over!!,the United States,16-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I got this 3 days ago and waited to review it just in case I was in a honeymoon phase.Cuz I'm in love.We have 8 kids, 2 dogs and a yard of fresh black dirt.I would do my floors once or twice a week and you couldn't tell a half hour later. It seemed SO pointless and SO time intensive I would do my floors once a week and we'd all wear shoes if we wanted to not walk in the mess.The first time I used this it worked AWESOME in our slightly muddy, very crumbly kitchen/ dining room. Even scrubbing through day old juice.When I got to the hall, the sheer amount of mud made it difficult to get it ""polished"" but it got it pretty well!I did the self clean function and hit the muddy hall again and it was clean!My dog peed on the floor and I gritted my teeth and tried this. It cleaned it up BEAUTIFULLY.  It didn't just smear it around or anything like i was concerned it might. Then with the self cleaning function and cleaner I wasn't even creeped out by it afterward.The suction power is on point. I tried it on my berber carpet staircase and was really impressed! I tried it on my low shag living room and it did *okay*. That was the edge of its limit and it's not even made for carpet so I was impressed! The only thing that's clogged it so far was a whole hostess wrapper. I do pick up trash that size before I use it but that seems reasonable to me.Now I take less than a minute to vacuum up after meals, I grab it for every spill or when the dog trots through with muddy paws... it is SO convenient and SO effective. My mom even said my floors have never been cleaner!I thought I'd have to still do my weekly deep clean and this would just help get us through the week. But I do not anticipate pulling out my spin mop for awhile. This thing even gets pretty dang close to the edges!It's light and easy to use too.The one thing that might be a drawback to some is emptying the canister.  It has mud, fur, food in it but also confetti, plastic scraps etc. So you have to decide between dumping it outside or dumping it down the drain and picking out the hair clump. You could probably dump it in a plastic bag and throw it away. I don't really care but some might.If you HATE washing floors, be ready to love it. If you've spent money on numerous floor cleaning contraptions and ended up not liking any of them, your soul mate floor cleaner is here.*update*Still in love. I do sweep once a week or so cuz it doesn't get to very edges but I haven't had to pull out the mop. It's great.A friend recommended getting a dollar tree colander to drain it over then toss the hair/ dirt from the colander in the trash. Great idea!The little valve in the cleaner solution has broken(I'm highlight suspicious a child of mine busted it)  BUT it doesn't even matter. I just flip it into place quick and it doesn't leak at all. Splendid!I do give this baby a deep clean every month or two. The bottom gets a little yucky from my intense cleaning needs. But im thinking a normal sized family with maybe only 1 pet might be fine. Or even a family that didn't just have 6 puppies for 2 months... like I said, we have intense cleaning needs.",87
czc,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great wet dry vac,the United States,15-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She did her research and decided that this was the one she wanted and it was much less than the Bissel Cross Wave. She was amazed at how well it worked. I was thinking about getting one for myself so I tried hers. I was amazed at how well it cleaned. My only disappointment was the battery time. I could not do my whole house without have to recharge it. I like to clean my house all at one time so therefore I will not be purchasing one for myself. I can see where if you had small children and needed a quick cleanup it would be great. I would love if they had a model that was electric. I would buy it in a heart beat!,80

Well, after months and months I have found another machine that caught my interest and so I started researching this one, and after all the reviews and talking to people I decided I would try out the TineCO ifloor, and man I‚Äôm glad I picked this one! I‚Äôm so freaking impressed lol.I feel so old getting so worked up but damn!!! If you have messy kids, hardwood floor, and hairy dogs I can‚Äôt suggest this thing any more!

Brit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissel crossover can SUCK IT! This mop is FANTASTIC,the United States,13-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"5 stars across the board for me. It is a hard floor only mop, I saw a bunch of questions about this in the FAQ'S. I have not had to use it for pet purposes. If used for pet potty, be sure to definitely clean out the resevior where the dirty water collects and remove the brush and wash it as well. It works well when cleaned after EVERY use. I LOVE THIS MOP. Its also cheaper than the leading brand out now the bissel crossover. Works just as great and CORDLESS! Come on yall... Cordless!!!!!!It can leave streaks when drying, I adjusted my cleaning solution and clean it after every use. No more streaks!!!!!",83
KT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have for multiple pet homes!,the United States,21-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"How did I not know about you before, Tineco Ifloor Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum? After living in my house for 11 years with 2 cats and 2 dogs and all laminate floors, I have finally found a solution for my fur and dirt filled floors! I am beyond happy with this wet dry vacuum. It sucks up all the dirt and fur and I can mop at the same time! I‚Äôm in heaven! This cuts my cleaning time in half. No more sweeping first then mopping and still having bits of fur stuck on the wet floor from what sweeping left behind.  This lightweight wet dry vacuum is easy to move around and swivels into areas I need to vacuum. I‚Äôve been using this for several months now and have had no issues with it. It leaves my floors clean and doesn‚Äôt take a terrible amount of time to dry. I use 1/4 cup of Clorox Scentiva spray cleaner and mix with warm water and it leaves a clean scent, not overpowering.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Waste Your Money,the United States,16-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I used this three times before writing a review in order to give it a thorough evaluation.  Having had two Bissell's before that did a good job but were noisy and did not last long I hoped this one would be the answer.  It is quiet but the suction is poor and it leaves streaks if left to dry.  I had to follow with a towel to prevent it.  It dripped dirty water.  You are also better off vacuuming first in order to cover any size floor.  I had to repeatedly go back and forth to get it to pick up dirt.  The cleaning solution has no odor but I like my floor to smell good after going to all this work but you can't use any other cleaning solution.,71
Jessie K. Sams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where has this been?,the United States,28-Jun-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to find this!  I almost bought one on Costco, but chose this for the cordless feature.  They appear to be very similar.Considering that I didn't know these things existed, I was very excited to find something that claimed to vacuum, clean and was cordless?!  Wow.Well, it did not disappoint.  I have two shedding dogs and cleaning floors is a constant thing around here.  It came today and I charged it up and spent about an hour cleaning with it.  I did the self-clean feature several times and also emptied and filled the tanks. One tank holds clean; the other dirty.  It puts out very little water so you aren't left with a ton of drying time.  It picked up an incredible amount of dog hair and dirt.  (we just had new vinyl plank flooring installed and it is so dirty from the dust and everyone walking on it). I'm very impressed!  I hope it lasts a long long time.  It is easy to use, maneuvers well and is fairly light.  Also not real noisy.  Takes about  3 hours to charge up.",80
Amber Nicole ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for price,the United States,17-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have had my Tineco vacuum mop for a week now and I feel I have used it enough to write a proper review. I run a dog business in my home and I was looking for something to make moping easier and more sanitary. Since using this I noticed my grout is looking cleaner after a week. If you have a lot of dogs (or even one hairy dog) I would recommend to vacuum prior to using this. It can definitely pick up all the hair but then it gets all wet and is a real mess to clean when you‚Äôre done. I do not recommend buying their cleaner. Took weeks to come in and it‚Äôs a small bottle. My downstairs area is 1300sq ft and I refill the water about three times to get through mopping daily so I ran out of the cleaner in no time. I used plain Lysol floor cleaner in it and it did the trick. The battery life is ok. I can get through my whole session before it dies. Cleaning is however super easy! (If you vacuum prior) you can literally clean almost every part of it which I love.It is worth the buy! I do love it and show every one who comes over how well it works.,38
A. Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing vs Hoover Floormate,the United States,20-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My Hoover Floormate broke after only two years and I bought this to try instead. Comparatively, it is incredibly light and easy to maneuver, slides under furniture and into small spaces more easily, distributes water very evenly, and leaves floors less wet with no puddly spots. The dirty tank is easy to clean and the brush has a self clean function. The clean tank is easier to fill because the shallows it to be set in the counter without tipping (not so with Floormate). The tanks are small but sufficient for large eat-in kitchen, dining room, hallway, hall bath on one charge of battery. There is literally nothing about the Floormate that I prefer over this machine. Remains to be seen whether it will last.",74
GARY-USAF-VETERAN,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best I've ever had for half the cost,the United States,14-May-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We have a senior dog with a bladder problem. She has to pee 5-6 times a day, and we were going through a large roll of paper towels a day, this vacuum cleaner has been the best I had ever purchased. We tried ones that were far more expensive,  and were not even 2% as good as this. It's very easy to use, very light weight, and makes cleaning up dog pee, and all liquids so fast easy and almost fun... if your not sure about it, buy it, you'll never regret it.",77
Kimberly Henninger,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not so great,the United States,8-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this after reading all of the great reviews!  Sadly, it does not work very well for me.  I let it charge for a few days, super excited to try it out.  I went right to the kitchen with it.  Vacuumed first, it was OK.  Picked up the dog food pieces my doggie loves to leave around.  Didn't get very close to the baseboards though, first disappointment.  Now I'm ready to wash!  I go over the floor (it's white ceramic tile), there's my next disappointment.  It's not looking all that clean to me.  I continue on anyways, hoping for the best, now there is no water coming out.  What am I doing wrong?  Nothing according to the manual.  I turn it off, turn it back on, now there is water.  Now there isn't again. Turn it off and on again, alas water again.  I can't imagine doing this the whole time, I have an entire house of tile to do.  I thought, maybe empty the dirty water, even though there wasn't much in there at all.  Next disappointment.  The dry and the wet all go into the same place, GROSS!  I cannot dump this in my sink, there is most likely dust and hair that I do not want clogging my drain, plus the now soggy dog food pieces mentioned before and whatever else got sucked up.  Anyways, not sure why this thing is not putting out water when the trigger is pressed, but the parts of the floor that did get wet and cleaned, were still dingy looking.  And the puddles of dirty water being left behind with this thing was gross.  My hand hurt from holding the trigger down.  I gave up after 30 minutes of trying.  I had to wipe up the dirty water it left behind once I turned it off.  I would have been done in 10 minutes, start to finish with the old broom and the bucket of water and mop.  And, my floors would be clean.  I can't return this as I broke down the box for recycle day already, so I'm stuck with it.  Maybe I'll use it for spot vacuuming only.  Oh well, I really had high hopes for this and for making my floor cleaning easier.",22
Cheezr,4.0 out of 5 stars,so far so good,the United States,13-May-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have hard wood and linoleum floors and I have four cats. One of the little darlings left me a present the morning of the day that my iFloor would arrive. I have to say the unit is very quiet and very efficient. It really left the floors feeling squeaky clean. My previous floor machine was a hover floormatic which was very loud and did not do as good of a job of getting up dried cat mess...the liquid bins are small but the unit uses surprisingly little water and I did my whole house ~900 SQ FT with 1 1/2 tanks of water and detergent and emptied the dirty water tank 3 times. I also cleaned the roller each time because even though I vacuum frequently my house is basically a snow globe of cat hair.the unit is very very easy to use and to maneuver and I am very impressed at the cleaning abilities. No more mopping!I have no idea on reliability and have my fingers crossed that it will be good.I really liked their cleaning fluid but don't see it offered on amazon and not sure where to get more which I will eventually need.Overall I am very pleased with the purchase.** I do wish the battery were replaceable, I can only do 2/3 of my house on a charge. **",35

Bonnie M. Smith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Poor Customer Service,the United States,22-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Works. I bought this machine Sept. of 2019.Paid $199 through Amazon. Loved the machine while it worked. The battery died about three weeks ago, Nov.2020. Contacted the customer service. Quick response given, a few emails with questions from the "" advanced tech department"", no resolution. Warranty is supposed to be 2 years. They have sent me two emails stating that they were happy to help resolve my issue. NOT! This is so not resolved. Saved all of the emails and hoping that sometime in the near future it truly is resolved. You cannot replace the battery so when it dies you simply need to buy another machine. At least that is where my problem seems to be. Dec. 5, 2020, still  no help with issues. I have a one year old machine that I paid $200 for through Amazon and this company just simply doesn't care.",28
Critic,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is very light duty. UPDATE*******(,the United States,11-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is a very light duty floor cleaner.  Dont expect it to be a deep cleaning machine.  Mopping by hand would get your floors cleaner.  Not at all what I expected but will keep for quick spill cleanup. I bought this for $185.00 less than a week later it was $165.00. Now its not picking up all the water on a vinyl floor.  Unhappy!,32
Kelly,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Charged, Cleaned and Quit. ugg",the United States,29-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this after 4 Bissell Crosswaves broke down. After I received it I set the machine up as directed which was very easy and then began charging the unit. After 4 1/2 hours the light changed from blinking blue to white. I washed my floors in plain water and it worked very well. It left my floors clean but I noticed it had problems picking up some items from the floor such as small bread crumbs or sugar. It simply would not pick it up. I was able to clean around 2,000sq feet with one charge with 3 tank refills and had to empty it twice. The next day I turned the machine on and began cleaning again. Everything was going great and then the machine refused to turn off and I had to listen to it hum for what felt like an eternity. I plugged it back in and since that day the light is still blinking blue and I can not turn the machine on at all. As a consumer I am so frustrated with buying expensive machines to do the job they advertise only to get a subpar machine that breaks or barely does what its touted to do.",26
Alex L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A pleasant surprise,the United States,14-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My Hoover floormate died and I wanted to give this puppy a try. Since it is cordless, it is a lot easier to use. The brush design allows simplistic cleanup compared to the floormate. Included cleaning tool is useless, though. Battery allows me to clean a roughly 1300 sq. ft. space without recharging, and the machine uses little water. Now the negatives. iFloor seems a bit underpowered, even the spot mode doesn't always help. The brush cover is hard to re-install, since it requires a precise alignment. I'm keeping it, as it shortened the cleanup time in half.",26
Faranah,1.0 out of 5 stars,unreliable,the United States,5-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this and thought it was great. Took it with me to our summer camp for big yeRly cleaning. WOW! Tile, linoleum, and hardwood floors never looked so good - and cleaning was a snap!  It‚Äôs easy to clean the dirty reservoir and roller. Amazed at what this picks up - and no dirty water goes back on your floor. Just ordered a second one as I am leaving this one at camp for future clean up.  So happy I found this!update review: Bought this in July 2019. After less than a year, it stopped working. Wouldn't turn on. Not sure if a battery or on/off switch issue. After months of communicating with the company, they finally sent me a replacement. That was just a few months ago. Despite very limited use, it now has no suction! What is with the quality control of this company. I'm done. I just bought a Bissel Crosswave. The Tineco is great when it works, but don't count on it for the long term.",23
Litayo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ability to vacuum wet and dry, light weight and easy to maneuver, cordless",the United States,31-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Disliked - inability to extend under furniture, have to move them (trade off for clean & dirty canisters); unable to get in the corners for wet cleaning/wiping; inability to use replaceable batteries to extend cleaning time (battery is attached so you charge it, if it were replaceable multiple batteries could be purchased and used continuously).Likes - economical price for the product given its ability and compared to brand names; it actually works as described (even to vacuum low nap/pile carpet no advertised - tested); maneuverable and lightweight; convenient self cleaning ability, tray also makes convenient to store and retrieve for quick use; cleans with liquid not just vacuums dust making for cleaner floor surfaces; very easy set up; low noise; warning light when charging will be required; seller has parts available so you won't have to worry about replacing filters etc.Things to look out for - don't expect the dirty water canister to hold the same amount of liquid as the clean water canister. Remember it also has the floater, dust and other particles so it will fill up before the clean water is used up. Empty it periodically, you will be surprised of how dirty your floors were plus it won't run back out on your floor. It doesn't work while charging. Expect multiple passes in some cases, especially if cleaning was delayed or size of objects being vacuumed - manage your expectations, it does work.All in all, I really like this product and would recommend for users who frequently clean so won't require hours at a time from the battery or hard soils to use the battery in a single spot. It is a very handy replacement for broom and shovel/weeping or mopping jobs/wiping as it allows you to do these most conveniently at the same time!",19
Andyman129,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!,the United States,21-Jun-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Do not buy!  I had this vacuum for six weeks and it stopped working.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth triple digit price tag. *UPDATE*,the United States,13-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"*UPDATE* Someone representing TINECO contacted me (without my permission) and tried to bribe me to remove my negative review.  So now, it's been changed from a 2 star to a 1 star.  This company is DISHONEST, violating Amazon policies, and has been reported to Amazon.  If you want real reviews, this company doesn't support it.  I question how many ""5 star reviews"" are here, and how many negative reviews were covered up. *Edit* I moved this to the top, along with my 2nd update below.*Update 2*  I have been contacted no less than 7 times by 2 different people begging me to remove my bad review.  I don't want a gift card bribe.  I also do not want to be harassed because their product was poorly designed for my tastes/needs.  I issued a cease contact order.  I will update again if they also break that - considering they weren't supposed to contact me outside of Amazon to begin with - my next step will most likely be legal action.  DO NOT support this company.  They are dishonest, breaking their distributor agreement, bribing to make their product look better to deceive others into buying products that SHOULD be rated much lower than they are.  The 2 agents used every trick in the book to try and appeal to me, monetary reimbursement, claims of losing jobs for themselves and numerous others due to the center, etc.  Tineco encourages these disgusting practices, and I advise nobody support a company that's as dishonest as this one.  I have reported these grievances to Amazon, and will start reporting every instance of further contact as well.--------------------------------------I went back and forth between this and a crosswave and decided to jump on this when it dropped to under one-fifty.  Due to a favorable review by vacuum wars on youtube, I was really excited to try this and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  Due to it's capability as a dry/wet vacuum and battery operated, I figured it would be a good choice to quickly pick up after my dogs come inside from after a rain.When it arrived, I found it had a little charge on the battery, so I did a couple of quick dry pickup tests.  It picked up clumps of dog hair and small bits of loose dirt without issue.  So I let it charge, cleaned out the little bit of stuff I picked up, and after letting it charge, I ran my first wet test, using only hot water.  I didn't want to open the cleaner if I wasn't satisfied with it, and try to really clean at first without chemicals if I can.Pros:-Lightweight.-Clean water container seems to be adequately sized.  It really doesn't spray that much onto the roller at a time.-Relatively easy to clean.-Functions decently well as a dry vacuum on hard floors.-I really like the mop/brush roller combo they have.-Spot mode seems to work decently, and I would consider that a must have on any similar device.Cons:-NOISY.  Even from first start, mine had a lot of ""clacking"" and ""tapping"" that seems to be coming from the roller.-It does NOT perform well on anything beyond a ""light duty"" mess.  Several instances with dried mud, I had to take 15-30 seconds holding the roller on that specific spot before it could be considered ""clean.""-Battery life isn't very good.  While most people could have probably finished everything without issue, I found I had numerous stubborn spots that I had to really dwell on to get them cleaned , which ties into...-Normal use mode almost ineffective at times.  Having to use spot mode so frequently meant less overall battery life, and I ran out of battery before emptying the water tank the 3 times I used it.-Prone to clog frequently.  If you have ANY amount of dog hair in your home, the iFloor will pick it up on hard wood floors. And it will eventually choke.  Several times in troubleshooting wet pickup,  found myself having to frequently dump the dirty water cup (even when almost empty) and clean out dog hair from behind the roller and up in the dirty tank entryway.-Wet usage seemed to reduce suction more than seemed reasonable.-Price.  I don't believe this machine is worth a triple digit price tag.  I'd say about seventy five (half of what I paid!) is a reasonable price based on the performance I experienced with it.  This is a dry vacuum that can spritz water.  A twenty dollar stick vacuum has more overall suction that this does.The last use, the rear wheels started to squeak loudly, a further testament to the subpar build quality with this unit.  For a triple digit price tag, there should be no squeaks, no lack of suction, and no clacking from roller.  If you have already well maintained floors, this may end up being a usable unit, but not at the price tag of one fourty, here.This is a light duty, maintenance machine only, is what it seems.  A standard stick mop would be a better purchase for actual cleaning needs.And yes, I also think the Bissell dry/wet vacuums are overpriced too, but at least they should work to an acceptable standard as well.  This experience with Tineco has been so unfavorable that I am likely to never try any of their other products, which is very unfortunate.  I've heard they're fairly reasonable quality.Just not this unit.",17
Jennifer Moreno,5.0 out of 5 stars,The IFloor sucks the grime up leaving a clean floor,the United States,10-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Love this product.  My steamer would kill microbes but like a mop it just smears dirt around.  The ifloor sucks it all up leaving a clean floor.  Easy to use, light weight.  Live at the beach and have two dogs with tile and wood throughout house, sand gets everywhere.  This cleaned everything well.  Battery life is issue vs. having a plug in but, it‚Äôs worth not having to lug cord around.Had a Bissell before, this is a far more practical daily use product.",26

My home is all tile and I have small kids and pets so this needed to be able to go for a bit and clean well. I did like that it had a boost setting to get stuck on things off. The battery life seemed to be great especially for the power it had, it was light weight and easy to maneuver. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt make it through one cleaning before The ‚Äúoverheat‚Äù light came on.

CJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fail...updated,the United States,9-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Update: its great. No issues since the replacement.It was rockin for the first 30 minutes. Then it started flashing red and kept shutting off. I previously charged it for the 3-4 hours for first time use as the instructions said. I read the whole manual and went through the troubleshooting. The flashing red light means either the brush is blocked or the machine has lost power. The brush wasnt blocked and i had already charged it.  I called customer support, which wasnt very useful. The guy was nice but he seemed unsure, maybe it was his first day. He basically just told me what the manual already states and said to email them a video and then correspond vis email. That seemed like a hastle so i have requested  for a replacmemt sent from amazon. Ill try out the new one and update this. It sucks because this mop was amazing while it was working. It had great suction, its not loud, the water was nice and dirty so it was doung its job. Bummer it broke in less than an hour.",18
Leah,1.0 out of 5 stars,So disappointed,the United States,29-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs hot garbage. It works okay as a vacuum, picks up dirt but can‚Äôt get in corners or anything, my $40 Walmart vacuum is better. As a mop it‚Äôs horrible, it doesn‚Äôt clean up actual spots on the floor unless you hold the spot clean button and go back and forth over it for a minute straight. Takes less effort to bend over and wipe it off with my finger. Left my whole house streaky and half vacuumed and then I had to go back with my swiffer to get the actual grossness off my floors. I had high hopes but it‚Äôs just not a good product, it doesn‚Äôt work well and it‚Äôs definitely not worth the money.UPDATE: It‚Äôs even worse than I thought. I really wanted this to work at least half decent cause it could be so convenient to have with two little kids. Tried it two more times and both times I just want to throw it in the trash. Cleaned it top to bottom and ran it again today and it was just dumping nasty water on my floor. So I swept before I used it, tried to use it, and then had to mop the whole house after because it just made such a mess. Please save your time and money and get a different two in one this one is massively flawed.",9

Rachel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wanted to love it but there's definitely cons to work out,the United States,31-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"After seeing these all over my tiktok feed, I was hyped. Mopping and vacuuming separately is such a pain for me. Being a smaller person, normal vacuums are bulky and difficult to maneuver. A normal mop hurts my back when scrubbing. This sounded like it would solve those problems and it kind of did. However pet owners, keep reading...Pros:‚Ä¢ Lightweight and easy to manuvuer‚Ä¢ Fairly quiet. Not obnoxiously loud even when using spot mode. My dog is terrified of our vacuum but wasn't bothered by this.‚Ä¢ throughly cleans our LVP floors in our kitchen, bathroom, and living room. Wiped it with a paper towel after cleaning and it was white! Definitely happy with how well it did in this regard.‚Ä¢ battery life seems great. Was able to clean our kitchen, living room, and bathroom in one cycle.Cons:‚Ä¢ Doesn't pickup or clean edges around cabinets. Theres about a 1 inch space it just won't reach so I still need to use my normal vacuum and mop to clean those areas.‚Ä¢ Pet owners, be prepared to pull out all the fur from the roller between refilling and emptying the water tanks. We have 4 animals (2 dogs, 2 cats) with long fur and this thing definitely gets clogged. It's so gross pulling the wet fur out ü§¢As far as smell, the cleaning solution it comes with doesn't have a noticeable odor which I like.üëç When finished I've kept the parts out on the counter to dry so there's no lingering water to cause an issue.Overall I don't know if I would have purchased had I known about the edge issue and how pet hair clogs it. But since I already have it and it does clean well in the areas it can reach, I will keep it and continue to use it. Would love to see Tineco keep enhancing their products to solve the cons listed.",7
Alex Rockwood,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with this purchase,the United States,8-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Despite reading numerous positive reviews on this product I was disappointed with this product. I was coaxed into buying this one because my wife liked that it was cordless and lightweight. The first few times it worked really well and I was impressed, but after a few months of use (and keep in mind our apartment is small and this thing was used minimally), the vacuum started having problems and kept malfunctioning. It stopped getting any good suction from carpets and when it went to the wet-mode, it only spread a dirty pool of water all around the tiled kitchen floor. Keep in my vacuuming instead of taking 10-15min was now taking like 30-40min just to vacuum and clean up the mess this thing made. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product if you have anything larger than a small studio and if you have a pet forget it, this vacuum gets clogged with the slightest bit of dog or cat hair and gives an alarm. After using this for a while I just went and got a regular good-old plug-in vacuum that has been working good ever since. Hope this helps respective buyers and informs them on what they can truly expect from this item.",12
Lainey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for a family with kids, dogs, and hard tile or wood floors!",the United States,14-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I took a chance and bought this off brand due to the cost/savings verses name brand. So far I‚Äôve been happy with my purchase and would recommend this product. I have hard wood floors in my living room and dining area. We have a large kitchen with tile. It works great on both areas. I go slower over the tile for a good suction. We also have five dogs and they track in a ton of dirt, dust, muddy prints, grass, and hair. This will dry vacuum up the debris and then I add my cleaning solution and it cleans the floors perfectly. Once I‚Äôm done I take the fabric roller off and clean it out, dump the dirty solution, and empty the water/solution tank. I set it in the holding tray and place it on the charger and it‚Äôs ready to go for the next cleaning round.

Brittany L.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective product with crappy customer service,the United States,23-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"After using this product twice it's already broken. The dirty water wont suck back up in the machine. I have included pictures showing how the machine is just pushing muddy puddles across the floor, how little dirty water was sucked up after mopping about 400sq ft and draining the clean water tank, and how dirty my mop bucket was after hand mopping the same 400sq ft area immediately following mopping with the defective tineco. I called amazon who patched me in with tineco. The customer service agent was great, he was shipping out a replacement mop withing 3 days. I was shocked it was so easy and even compliment the guy on such great service. About 4 days later I still had no replacement mop and now an email from tineco asking for videos and photos, which I happily sent. Waited a few more days to receive an email with some more questions for me to answer. Then a few more days pass. I receive an email saying the have approved a replacement product and to watch for an email with a return shipping label. Once again, 4 days later and no email for return shipping. So, totalling around 2 weeks and I'm just being ran in circles. I finally gave up and contacted amazon today about a refund, which not surprisingly I am just past the return date while dealing with the tineco email B.S. thankfully amazon will be refunding the item and sending UPS to pick up. It's really a shame because I wanted to like this product, I really wanted to just have my brand new machine to work properly. Instead I received crappy customer service (did I mention their phone lines dont work) and a lot of waiting around while mopping 1900sq ft manually. From here on I'll be going with the big name brands that are in the same price range.",10

Not only did it leave my hardwood floors streaky, but it left scratches everywhere and it‚Äôs impossible to get within an inch or so from the wall. It also took way too long to go over an entire room. I suppose this would be best for small spills or smaller areas, but then you‚Äôd end up needing to take apart and clean the entire machine afterwards. Personally, I‚Äôd stick with a regular mop and bucket for deep cleans and a few damp paper towels for spills and small messes. Great idea, just not quite perfected yet!",9

The videos seemed great! When I first got it I loved it! It cleaned my floors so well! The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was how time consuming it was to clean it after each use. You have to take it all apart and clean each piece. I didn‚Äôt mind though as long as my floors were clean.My house is small so the battery lasted long enough to clean my living room, kitchen, laundry room, hallway, 3 bedrooms, and 2 bathrooms. I didn‚Äôt have to empty the dirty water tank or refill the water.After a few weeks I find that it doesn‚Äôt pick up small things as well anymore (Glitter, small crumbs, dirt) It also doesn‚Äôt wet the floor as much as it did! It took at least 10 minutes of me pushing the trigger over and over and holding it down messing with it for it to even wet my floor. I made sure I had assembled it correctly.

It‚Äôs currently August 2020, we haven‚Äôt even made it a full year. The first one I ordered broke within 30 days. The company was incredibly slow to respond and took over three weeks to get back to me. Luckily I was able to return it to amazon.The second unit is the one I‚Äôve been using for the past few months. It‚Äôs slowly broken down bit by bit. Right now it makes a strange loud noise. It‚Äôs not clogged or anything, it‚Äôs the motor burning out. The machine barely scrubs the floor. And today the clean water tank has somehow started leaking all of the water straight through the machine and flowing out of the bottom, making it completely useless. For the amount of $$ this thing costs it is poor quality. I‚Äôve cared for it carefully and it just...doesn‚Äôt clean well and breaks easily.",10
Amanda Barnett,1.0 out of 5 stars,I will continue to use my Cross Wave. :),the United States,14-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We have four kids so our dining room area gets dirty quick. With the hustle and bustle of life sometimes objects do get overlooked while cleaning. It maybe the next day we get to a deeper clean while two of our kids are in school. If you have a need for deep cleaning, this isn't for you. If you let things dry, it will take several passes and solution to even start to look like you are getting the stubborn mess out. I broke out my cross wave and in one pass it picks it up in no time. Sure, the Tineco will eventually pick it up but you have to sit on the stain and pull the trigger until next year or something. I wanted to like it but I see no reason in keeping an inferior product when comparing it to my current cross wave. The suction power is not there. I passed over some ball sprinkles and they were still on the floor after several passes The battery life is ehh at best and compound the charging times, no thanks. The Good is that it's cordless but that's about it.",6
Justanother80'sTiffany,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for busy moms/daily driver,the United States,7-May-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Clean is subjective. My house is cleaner now than it normally is because this drastically cuts time to sweep and mop. It is much easier to use than a broom and mop and MUCH less physically intense. It has no cord which comes in handy more often than I would've thought. It also picks up a ton of pet fur. The dirty water and solids are all in one container making disposal tricky. Changing out dirty water and adding more cleaning solution is quite easy though. I generally leave it on ""spot"" clean which is a higher intensity and find that it does a decent job cleaning dried on dirt etc. There are still a few items that I have to pick at on occasion though. It does not get around corners or edges at all. The self cleaning brush roll is pretty good about staying clean. I've had this for over a month now and I consider it my daily driver. I use it every day for a quick and decently thorough clean. I can always use a steam mop to get a much more thorough clean if necessary.",14
Laurzzzy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery Failing Within 90 Days.,the United States,30-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Four months in and battery life is down to 5 minutes. Battery has a one year warranty according to their website but they aren‚Äôt honoring their warranty.Three months in and the battery life is down to 8 minutes running time. I‚Äôm able to get through two rooms cleaning and it dies. About half the time it was able to run for originally without needing a charge.Charging time is 2.5 hours. So to not be able to finish the job all of a sudden 2.5 hours is a long time to wait to finish cleaning one chore.I‚Äôve taken excellent care of the device cleaning every compartment after each use. There is no reason why a new device should be dying this soon.As far as the actual ability toclean the floors it is only worthwhile in spot mode. Regular mode won‚Äôt do enough to remove even a basic smudge mark on the floor.I‚Äôm really not impressed with the company either. I‚Äôve been dealing with them back and forth on the dying battery for two weeks now and gotten nowhere.,5

Christina m,1.0 out of 5 stars,So disappointed,the United States,8-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is my second vacuum I have bought. My first one I absolutely love! So I got one for my mom for Christmas and it showed up in a damage box after Christmas too. We opened it today and ran it until the battery died and did all the necessary cleaning & charged it. We decided to try it out after it had a full charge. The vacuum continuously ran and ran and would not shut off even after numerous attempts with the off and on bottom. We had to wait until it completely died for it to stop. Now it won‚Äôt run at all. I‚Äôm so disappointed because I spoke so highly of this wet vacuum and recommended it to multiple people. We will be returning it and I will not recommend this product to anyone.,10
Mom B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty nifty mop/ vac- NOT completely self cleaning!,the United States,23-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I haven‚Äôt had a mopping vacuum before this. The jury is still out on whether it‚Äôs a keeper. I only have one more week to return so I will use it several more times and then decide.There is a bit of a learning curve, which is probably because of my floor. I tried it once on LVT (vinyl tile) and it was a complete pleasure. However the main area I use this on is shiny tile with grout lines. The vacuum is great. The mop needs a little time and patience- it takes a few minutes to get the brush roller wet enough to actually be mopping. You need to figure out when to hold down the spray trigger and when to use spot clean. They both work well. There is very little water used, and it mostly leaves my floors streak free. Except when it doesn‚Äôt. Every so often as we go over a grout line a little pile of dirt emerges and I have to vacuum a few times to get it sucked back up.My main complaint is that this claims to be self cleaning. It‚Äôs not. There is a cool little self clean cycle the rinses the brush, but there‚Äôs a pretty intense cleanup after each job. You need to empty the dirty water receptacle and rinse it as well as clean the sponge. If you rely on the self cleaner to clean your brush roll and do nothing else, you‚Äôll have a moldy, filthy brush roll before long. You need to manually remove the brush roll, rinse it, and clean out the area with a paper towel or something, otherwise the dirt in that area will go right back onto your floor. Then you need to air dry the brush roll before you put away the vacuum. This is a bit much for me, and honestly has reduced the number of times I use the vacuum/ mop. I‚Äôm not taking it out for a quick cleanup job if I have to clean the mop so intensely afterwards. It might still be worthwhile but be prepared for that cleanup. It‚Äôs not actually mentioned anywhere- they tout the self cleaning in the listing and manual quite a bit.I love that it‚Äôs cordless and it holds a charge about as long as two water tanks full. I can do about 2 large rooms in that time.",7
BB,1.0 out of 5 stars,More cons than pros,the United States,21-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes but those high hopes plummeted to the ground and burst into flames. Cons: leaves approximately 1 inch gap between machine and baseboards etc. so you still have to do some manual labor to clean all of those areas...may as well just commit to the manual labor and have a better outcome for the floors. The cleaning product sent with the machine leaves a dull film on the floors. Again, you have to put more manual labor into getting a better shine. Machine clean up is a bit intensive as you have to remove several parts, clean them and then let them all dry so it doesn't stink while being stored between uses.Pros: Machine is light weight and product design is attractive.  Has decent maneuverability. Decent length for the power cord.Overall, the product might be better for the quick clean up. Also may be better for the smaller spaces like apartments versus large homes with kids, husbands, dogs, and country dirt.I will be sending mine back. Easier just to get the 'ol mop out.",10

It was so incredibly time consuming. This is a dream come true. It picked up stray litter, pet hair and dust leaving my floors absolutely clean and spotless without streaks. I have laminate floors and my concern was the machine dumping too much water on them. This did not happen because I had a great amount of control as to the amount of water going onto the floor. The machine cleaned them but left them only slightly damp and they dried within a minute or two.A bottle of cleaning solution was included. Since only a capful is used with each full of water, this will last for a very long time. So far, I‚Äôm thrilled to have this machine in my life.",6

The one I had was a glorified swifter but wouldn‚Äôt pick up cat litter. This one does. I‚Äôm not overly fond of the mop while sweeping function but I will test it out more and see. Separate it is fantastic! Only 2 days in so far. It cleaned my 3 rooms easy.  Update 2 months later I cannot express enough how much I hate this device! It was perfect for a month but now it gets clogged every use even though I clean it a after every use. When it mops it doesn‚Äôt clean and leaves this nasty brown mess all over the floor. Again despite being cleaned after every use.,11
ffmusicdj,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to break,the United States,15-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Seems they took extra steps to make sure the bottom of the vacuum is tough and durable, meanwhile the container I use to fill water up with is very very flimsy, and broke from the inside when I used the vacuum the 3rd time. No hard force, no abuse of power, it just up and broke.The vacuum is not very good for picking up dry stuff. Imagine taking all the horrifying hair and dirt and dust mixing with water, that's what you have to look forward to when cleaning out the container. I'd rather use a bagged vacuum.If the container overflows, the vacuum will begin to spill water under the vacuum uncontrollably. Okay, simple enough, just fill the water up to the line in the container to not overflow the container right? Well... Sometimes the vacuum will overflow even when you don't fill the container up all the way. How? I don't know but there you have it.Last but not least, that suction power is awful.",7

It had good reviews, which I don‚Äôt understand. The way this is designed keeps you from cleaning near furniture, baseboards, or anything else. It also doesn‚Äôt allow you to go under any furniture that‚Äôs closer than about 18‚Äù from the floor. You can go under the dining table, but that‚Äôs about it. It seems to just be a really poor design.Update 12/03/19I‚Äôve had to come back and lower my rating to one star. I was already pretty unhappy with this, but it turned out that my husband had thrown out the box, so I didn‚Äôt have the packaging to return it, so figured I would use it for what I can. We‚Äôve just had vinyl plank flooring installed, and tried it out on the new flooring today. It left streaks/marks all over the floor.

Christina Vogel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,12-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"At first, I was obsessed with this for the first times I used this. I have a toddler, and so I used it like TikTok users. Sucking up toddler messes from dinner. It cleaned up things easily, but then that‚Äôs where my issues started. Even though there are only 2 parts to ‚Äúclean‚Äù there are a lot of crevices, and those Cheerios I sucked up, pasta, spaghetti sauce, water, was getting stuck in those crevices. The nice thing about the self cleaning was that it got those bits of food out. However, the second issue started.I would do the automatic clean, and then rinse all the parts and pass with a sponge. I would let them dry, and I came to found that no matter how long I dried the parts, I couldn‚Äôt get them 100% Dry. Nor could I get the inside of the machine completely dry. Therefore I would turn it on the next time using it, and it would smell of stale water. Gross when you‚Äôre trying to clean the house.I like the idea of it, but the way it‚Äôs advertising to withstand pet hair, easy for moms to clean up kids messes, it really doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm sure that the newest model has worked better and has been modified, but unfortunately, I am selling this.Also, why on earth does the company not accept returns??!",4

What the point of a vacuum cleaner if it itself needs more cleaning than a mop ?-After a couple months of weekly use, it‚Äôs leaking dirty water from its deep inaccessible channels and tubes at all times.

I thought this was going to be a great purchase being that I saw videos on it, but mine must be malfunctioned or something because it‚Äôs horrible. I have issues with the water coming out & I have to stop vacuuming and mopping every 3 minutes to clean the brush and make sure there‚Äôs nothing blocking the water from coming out. There‚Äôs nothing ever blocking it. I ran it through already clean floors and barely any water wants to come out and then sometimes no water comes out at all. I work hard for my money & I am upset that I spent $180 on this. I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you get the cheaper thing, but I really thought based on videos this was a better purchase than the bissell crosswave. It is not. Everything is put together exactly how the manual states and I have cleaned it and let it dry twice and it still does not work properly. I have only used it 3 times. If possible I would like a refund and would like to return it.",7
Bea,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth it.,the United States,18-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My situation: I have about 1000 square feet of nice faux hardwood floors, some sort of laminate I suppose, and a cat and a dog that both shed a fair amount. I also cook for my family multiple times a day. And I do NOT like a messy house. So the floors are cleaned multiple times a day. I used to use a light weight vaccum and then go over it with a Bona microfiber pad and cleaning spray. Now that I have the Tenico I can just do one swoop and the foor are clean EXCEPT about 1/4-1/8 of an inch around the molding at the base of the walls. I do still just use the Bona microfiber sweeper and spray to hit those edges. Using the Tenico saves a lot of time and the floor are really clean.Also, if you are a clean freak like me, you know it's not just how well a machine cleans but how much work you have to put into cleaning the machine itself. It says it has a self cleaning mode but this just seems to spin the roller extra fast and and spin some of the dirt and extra water off of the roller but it isn't clean. Cleaning the machines is very straight forward, all you do is take out the dirty solution cup, dump it, rinse it. The roller pops off easily too. Personally, I disefect it once a day by letting the parts sit in a little bleach and water for 2 mins or so. Total cleaning time for machine is about 3 mins. SO quick and easy!I also use it in my bathroom on tile floors. It doesn't get the grout super clean but if you use it daily like I do it will work just fine. Also, my favorite spot to clean is near the litter box which I have on a tiled floor. It make such quick work of cleaning that area it's unbelievable!!! I even removed her litter mat! Everyday I just take less than one minute to vaccum/mop around it and under it. Perfectly clean!Overall, I would recommend it, particularly if you have pets.",2
Allyson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the trouble,the United States,28-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The suction is fine as long as what you pick up is dry- but that kinda defeats the purpose. It barely wets the floor, or rather it dispenses water unevenly leaving dry streaks in the middle while the edge pours water. It pushes wet dirt around, think things that get heavy when wet, like cat fur, mud etc... definitely not for pet people. It doesn't clean around the wall or in corners and you can't really get under things. Cleaning up the machine is a chore. It would be nice if it was as great as wanted it to be but it just isn't worth the hassle when you just have to go back and clean what it misses and clean it.",8

The brush does not scrub as advertised. I found myself reverting back to the swifter sweeper wet jet for every sticky mess my toddler left. It takes forever to clean the floor due to this. It feels very cheap and operates as a cheap floor cleaner. The battery is seriously lacking, I have a 500 sq ft area of hardwood floor and it did never lasted to clean it, even when I didn‚Äôt have it on the ‚Äúspot cleaning‚Äù mode.. which is the only mode that can clean up any small dried juice spots that happen when my toddler drops his sippy cup.

This is not worth the money nor the hype that it has received. Please don‚Äôt waste your money I will be reaching out for a refund as this does not do much that is should. It only puts water on the surface and can only pick up very small items like size of a rice small. It will not scrub at all no matter how many times you go over something stuck on the floor good it won‚Äôt get it off the floor and you will have to just use a mop or rag. I would not waste my time using this than having to sweep and mop still afterwards. This doesn‚Äôt clean at all in my option it just will spread the stuff all over your floor.,3

I even sweeper before using this!I just had a cleaner come in and clean our floors, so they are pretty clean. But I was so excited to try my new vacuum! I spent more time stopping to unblock the sprayer than I did any cleaning. If the amount of dirt right after a professional cleaner coming in will cause blockage, I‚Äôd hate to find out what my weekly cleaning will turn into.

Sundar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product for the price - Excellent after sales service,the United States,31-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have been looking for a good wet cleaner but cordless and this one checks all the boxes. Been using this for three months now and no major complains. As with any equipment, you need to keep them clean and maintained, but other than that it is a fine piece of equipment.If I have to find any negatives, the one thing is sometimes the water spray does not seem to be even across the brush roll. It is more on the right side and less on the right side as you can see it on the floor. It is not a deal breaker as it does the cleaning very well. I use one of the no suds cleaner - just a little added to warm water and the kitchen floors are squeaky clean. Battery life is normal for this size of equipment at around 35 to 40 minutes. You have to understand that any attempt to improve will result in increased weight and will affect maneuverability.One other improvement I would love is if they can come up with removable batteries. That way, we can buy an additional battery and keep cleaning for more time.Update Late October 2019 - The clean water tank broke at the bottom with parts coming off. Called them and opened a ticket - no hassles at all and a NEW CLEAN TANK WAS SENT BY FEDEX WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS. Excellent service with no follow up required.

Christopher leathers,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good vacuum if you live in your house,the United States,24-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Sure, it works great. If you dont live in your house. Ive given this vaccuum a solid 24 hours with multiple attempts to work how I visualized it to work, but unfortunately unless your floors or spotless beforehand you will need to mop after you have used the ifloor to mop.The vaccuum did great at first. Cleans up the sand off the tile floor which is a great feature when youre in Florida and with a brand new roller it mopped the floors well. It wasnt until the roller got dirty that I had the issue pictured above. So unless youre willing to take the vacuum apart and clean every inch of it at every pass, I wouldnt waste your money. Oh and did I mention it leaves a good 2 inch streak of dirt along any walls or furniture. Simply not built to get close to the wall.Would be a great vacuum for an older person who has no pets and has a hard time spot mopping when necessary.

Its more time consuming than moping with a mop, but less strain on the back.  Not spreading dirty water back over the floor like a mop would.  If there was a removable charging battery that I could swap out to do my whole house at one time I would give it 4 stars instead of 3.

A. D. Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,Updated: Just under a year later ‚Äì¬†the unreplaceable battery is dead.,the United States,18-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"(I've updated this review from a 1 star to 5 stars. I contacted customer support and within 2 emails was sent a new machine. The new machine is fantastic. Tineco's swift customer service earns the stars that the machine doesn't.)Original review:Tineco produces beautiful products. I like they way they move and I love the design. I have both a vacuum cleaner and this floor cleaning unit. The Tineco  iFloor cleans well enough, it has excellent suction and it cleaned 1,200 Sq. Ft. of bamboo flooring better than a steam mop.However, the battery on the iFloor lasted less than a year and it no longer holds a charge.Just in case I received a defective cleaner, I will review the rest of the Tineco iFloor's abilities:Suction: GOOD! Really, really GOOD!Cleaning solution: Fine but not powerful with a shoes-off house with three outdoor/indoor cats, a child, and two adults.Solution distribution: You'll need to do two passes to actually clean the floor.Action: I could move this unit under tables and around furniture like a champ.Cleaning experience: For 1,200 Sq. Ft. House I had to refill the solution canister an average of 2.5x per floor cleaning ""session"" . Sometimes it would leave streaks.What I loved: I could clean my floor without a mop and bucket.What I hated: Emptying the dirty water canister is painful. You have to remove the canister, Remove the canister lid, Remove the filter, dump out the dirty water (in the toilet because dumping dirty water in the sink is not a good lifestyle choice) and then rebuild the dirty water receptacle and then replace it. It gets painfully tedious when you clean your floors 3x a week.If you buy this buy the extended warranty, use it lightly, and don't hope to use it past 11.5 months.Now to figure out where I can recycle this junk.",2
Megatron Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Easy for everyday cleaning,the United States,15-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It's 10/28 and they have sent me a shipping label. I've  contacted the a few times a week and they keep say that they have system problem for the label. I call bull, since they don't make this product anymore and probably don't care about support, therefore amazon reviews don't matter. It's 10/08/30 and it stopped working. Tineco is sending me a replacement and shipping label. I took away 2 stars. I think the battery stopped taking a charge, but I'm not sure. I never stored it with a dead battery, which is a no for lithium.Works great on hard floors. I used it with Mr Clean and it foamed a little, because that's what I had on my first use and it performed well. I keep it in the kitchen and pass it whenever I have a spill or a little extra dust even if it's dry or wet. I tried it dry on my throw rug and it picked up the loose surface dirt, but don't expect a deep stuff to come out. It will not get stuck on dirt easily, unless it soaks for a little, because it's too light and gentle. I left it to overflow, because when the dirty tank is full, suction will stop and get the hard stuff wet and then sucked it up. One tank of clean solution will fill the dirty tank twice. Clean up takes as much time as it will cleaning a mop when you're done. I will be getting mop n glow to try it or something less sudsy for hardwood floors. It's worth the buy if you have a lot of hard floors. I wish the battery was replaceable, but it last long enough to clean my first floor without dying. As with any lithium battery, you need to keep them charged and at room temperature for a prolonged lifetime.",4
Alea,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hardwood floors ONLY--and does NOT clean near the baseboards.,the United States,9-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was researching for so long for a good vacuum that I ended up buying this as a Prime Day whim. Unfortunately, not as good as advertised.The commercials made it seem like it can be used as a wet/dry vac, but I PROMISE you--it only works as a wet vac. On top of that, the instructions you get specifically say for floors with no carpet ONLY. Very disappointed that the infomercials kind of fibbed to get more buyers.The second main issue is that no matter what you try, you cannot clean close to the baseboard whatsoever--so you'll end up having to use a mop or Swiffer ANYWAY to pick up some leftover mess. That truly sucks, and this flaw is not advertised anywhere. It leaves about two inches away from the wall, so be warned.Other flaws include using up a lot of liquid and having to change out often (not sure how some of these reviewers say they cleaned a 300ft+ house and only changed the water once, they're probably paid reviews). And when you put back both cartridges, it's quite difficult to since they get stuck easy, so you have to slam it quite hard to get it in.Three stars are for it being cordless, easy to charge, and the pretty straight forward setup. I also like the self cleaning aspect, and the tray is helpful for keeping everything at one station. The suction is just okay, not the best.If I had a choice I would personally not buy this one again, maybe if they would have fixed the newer model to get closer to the baseboards, but I doubt it. I am literally just keeping this because it's a cordless vacuum and I'm too lazy to get another cordless one lol. Look elsewhere and good luck!",One
Anthony Miller,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not recommend!,the United States,23-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Ugh, the reviews had me super excited to try this vacuum mop‚Ä¶.but I was left sorely disappointed. First, the cord was damaged right out of the box. Why they wouldn‚Äôt put protectant foam or something around the cord (as it just hangs until it‚Äôs inserted into the handle) is beyond me! Set up was super simple, and the vacuum section was great‚Ä¶that‚Äôs about the only good thing I have to say. The roller left streaks on my floors and several passes were needed in order to clean all areas. Wheel marks were left along with the streaks, which was disappointing. Emptying the canister was a disaster! So much debris gets stuck in the canister, roller, filter, and roller panel that it took longer to clean the unit than it did to do my floors! This was supposed to be a more efficient time saver‚Ä¶sadly, it left much to be desired! Will be returning!",2
Kyle S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't recommend,the United States,17-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Terrible purchase.  I enjoy the cordless vacuum I bought from them so I thought this too would be good.  However not only is the performance on tile subpar, and the charging cord annoying,  but the valve inside the clean water solution tank already broke.  Likely 6-7 fillups in that tank and bam - valve comes apart.  It's actually three plastic tank that has clips to hold the valve in place and one of those clips is broken. It's not even a wearable item really.I usually use mops and swiffers and they both work better at cleaning plus if they do break it's like $5.UPDATE:  Since posting this review I've been emailed 3 times by the seller trying to bribe me with $15 then $20 to delete this comment.  They tried to explain that they are aware of this issue and are working to fix it but apparently they're still trying to sell the units despite the known issue or else they wouldn't be bribing me.I'm not easily bought.",2
Female User,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don‚Äôt agree with all the fuss,the United States,21-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was excited for this gadget. I have a salon and it doesn't have space for traditional mopping activities and looked for something the staff could clean the floors with without needing an entire utility closet. This DOESN'T do basic cleaning never mind also vacuuming. It‚Äôs great at spitting a bunch of water into the floor and making the salon smell clean, but it‚Äôs ability to clean, I wouldn‚Äôt even say is mediocre. I wish I was paying attention to the return date because this would WITHOUT A DOUBT GO BACK!!!! It is light weight and has good maneuverability. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, buy a remote control toy car.",6
Jayd,4.0 out of 5 stars,Necessity in my all hard wood animal friendly home,the United States,6-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I got this as a late Christmas gift and after a month I must say this was a learning curve. I have an all hard wood 2 bedroom 1 bathroom trailer with not a lick of carpet anywhere, and my home has 4 dogs, 5 cats, and a chinchilla, so you can imagine the mess than unravels throughout the day. First thing I noticed is this doesn't do the best with wood pellet litter, and doesn't do the best with hay, so I find myself having to sweep at least my bedroom because it's constantly struggling to pick up pellets from my cats and hay from my chinchilla, so that alone knocks one star off for me, I think it's a design flaw with the roller. The second thing is that I find it easier and that it clogs less if I dry vac first and then mop, but thank God the battery is good enough to run through my whole house twice without dying. You do have to unclog it and clean it thoroughly after each use, which sucks, but it's not the end of the world, I highly suggest purchasing a drain snake to clear it out much easier than the cleaning tool it comes with. If you aren't properly unclogging it it will spread around dirty water because it's not sucking anything up. I haven't had an experience with any big wet messes, so I have nothing to really say on that topic but for foot/paw prints, every day dust and dirt, this tackles it beautifully. I use it once a day and plug it in over night to charge as charging takes a bit of time. If you're considering getting this, I'd say it's well worth the money. I'm so happy I'm able to cut my cleaning time in half.",2
Yvonne Pepper,1.0 out of 5 stars,This wet/dry mop/vacuum is worthless!,the United States,28-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Poor suction and leaves a trail of objects and dirty water that the vacuum isn't strong enough to pick up.  I have had it for 6 weeks and kept trying different things but nothing works.  Mop roller barely reaches the floor so you have to go over a spot 20 times to get it mopped off the floor.  By then you have put too much solution down and the vacuum won't pick it up.  Then the machine is too wet and nothing goes in the canister, it just sticks behind the roller and clogs up.  Of course it is outside the return policy so I am stuck with it.",10
Miles,2.0 out of 5 stars,Your Edges Will Never Get Cleaned,the United States,27-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"When I clean I want EVERYTHING clean, unfortunately this Tineco iFloor cleaner can't do that. This machine can not clean edges! Like along a baseboard, a tub, a vanity or a toilet. Even if you try to push the front or the sides right up and into an edge, it will disappoint you, I promise. It does vac decently, but you'll have 1.5 inches around everything... untouched! ""If you won't do the job completely, don't do it at all!"" my father told me - I've followed that bit of advice all my life and that's why I'm returning my iFloor cleaner",4
Carol,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor battery life,the United States,23-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I will start by saying this would be a great product if it had battery packs instead of a internal battery that needs charged all the time. My house is 1170sq ft using this product per the instructions only squeezing the trigger on the backstroke overlapping 1in I can not get the floors all the way washed. I do not have carpet we have hardwood and tile floors and 3 dogs that do not shed that much but get a lot of muddy dog prints. I can get the kitchen a hall way and part of the living room cleaned then it runs out of battery and I have to charge it for 3 hours. It doe get the muddy paw prints up light weight easy to use until you have to charge it again then you have to clean it so all the dirt does not dry up in it. I also have a bissell crosswave so I can clean the hole house and area rugs just wanted something to clean muddy paw prints so the grandkids don't get dirty and the house looks better. I would of returned if I did not throw away the box. If it had 2 battery power packs this thing would be great. I did give it 3 stars that is it no more.,4
paige,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed and not all what's cracked up to be.  Not for a house with lots of traffic,the United States,7-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,At first I kind of liked it but honestly it's more work to keep the same clean than it is to just sweep and mop. And it does leave spots on my floor. I have wood snap in flooring and it doesn't suck up all the water and it's been leaving spots in my flooring is kind of bubbling up. Kind of wish I could just get my money back I wish I never bought it it really wasn't all that's cracked up to be. The only thing that's good about it is that it's easy on your back but you still have to sweep around corners and edges because it doesn't reach that close to the wall. Plus it stinks horrible if you don't clean it after each use.,3
John,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lacks Performance,the United States,18-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I should have trusted my instincts when purchasing this item.  I reviewed wet/dry cleaners on the Online Consumer Reports web site and there were no reviews available.  I read many Amazon customer reviews on this type of cleaner and the Tineco iFloor cordless wet dry vacuum cleaner and mop received the most favorable reviews.  Unfortunately, the machine lacks in performance.  It is loud, the electrical charge does not last long, it leaves streaks while cleaning, and the suction of the vacuum is lacking.  I based my purchase on the ability of the machine to vacuum cat hair as we have three cats.  Unfortunately, I had to follow my wife with a broom and dustpan while she vacuumed as she left a trail of cat hair behind.  The wet mop does perform better, but as I said, it leaves streaks.  Also, it is tedious to clean.  I will go back to cleaning my floors with my trusty broom, dustpan, and my Shark Professional Cleaner.  Hopefully, in the future there will be a more powerful and effective wet/dry cleaner available.",3

E,4.0 out of 5 stars,Product has a learning curve,the United States,26-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I thought this product was going to solve all my pandemic problems, or at least the constant messes on my kitchen floor. The first several times I used it, I was un-impressed. However, I joined some Tineco groups on social media that helped me solve some issues.One--the dirty water tank fills quickly and leaks when full, making dirty streaks all over the floor. Solution? Empty it during cleaning as necessary.Two--the brush roll doesn't clean off all surface stains, particularly if they have been there awhile. Solution? Pre-soak stains with a spray bottle, and use warm water in the water tank (not too hot as instructed).Three--the machine stops picking up debris mid-use. Solution--don't suck up things that might clog the machine (large pieces of pasta, scraps of paper, etc.). Pre-sweep the floor to at least pick up things that might clog the machine. To un-clog, simply remove the brush roll cover and brush roll, and remove the obstructing object.After learning these tips, I like my mop a lot more. It makes my life easier when cleaning up spilled milk, mushy vegetables, and even spaghetti!Problems not resolved--this mop cannot reach or clean in corners/along walls well at all. :(",2
Kristen,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for textured vinyl flooring,the United States,23-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this after all the things I had heard about it. My whole house is vinyl flooring except for the bathrooms which are tile and I‚Äôm a full time working mom, so I was so hopeful this would save me the time of vacuuming first and then mopping. However I was disappointed. If you have textured vinyl flooring, this will not be the miracle cleaner you were hoping for. Not only was it  barely getting crumbs and other dirt marks off the floor, even in spot mode, but the wheels were leaving scuff marks all over! I couldn‚Äôt do my whole kitchen/living area on one charge so I‚Äôd have to do half and then charge it before doing the other half. My kitchen/living area also required me to fill the clean water tank several times. My house is really not that big. After all that, when the sunlight came in from the windows onto the floor, it still looked dirty. It did however work wonderfully on my tile floor in the bathrooms. But to pay this price for something that was only good for cleaning small bathroom floors just wasn‚Äôt worth it to me and I returned it.",One
iamsparky,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad, but could use more suction power.",the United States,11-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Overall, I really like the Tineco iFloor unit. It's easy to maneuver, easy to use, easy to clean, and does a decent job of cleaning my tile floors. We have nearly 2000 sq.ft. of tile in our home; and it has, so far, been able to clean all of it with a single charge. Just doing the ""wipe test"" has shown me how well it cleans. Take a section of floor, wipe it with a damp paper towel, see how dirty it is. Then do the same after using the iFloor....there is no trace of dirt! My methodology for cleaning is to spray solution on a forward stroke and suck up the dirt/solution on a backwards stroke. It seems to work very well. Here are my beefs about this unit: 1. I wish it had more suction power. While it does a reasonable job of taking up the wash solution, it could be a little better. 2. No removable battery. While the unit has been able to clean all of my tile in a single charge, I foresee the day, as with all battery operated tools, that the battery will start to degrade; and it would sure be nice to have a spare battery to plug in when needed.",4
Mackinzee Barnes,5.0 out of 5 stars,100% Worth It,the United States,27-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I found myself in the same position as many others on here; I‚Äôve wanted the Bissel Crosswave for a long time, but couldn‚Äôt bring myself to spending the money. I saw a Facebook post about this bad boy and figured with the price tag, it was worth a shot, and I‚Äôm very glad I did. This thing has become an everyday routine for me. At first, I took the time to go around the floor with my cordless Dyson to pick up the majority of things, but I‚Äôve learned there‚Äôs really no need. The iFloor does a pretty great job as a vacuum, and the only things I‚Äôve found it hasn‚Äôt picked up, the Dyson wouldn‚Äôt have got either (pine straw, large leaves, larger random things). The first time I used this, I was mortified how dirty the water was. It does a great job with picking up hair, which is very helpful when having three females and two dogs in the house. I use it on my large area rug every day and I still can‚Äôt believe how much hair that thing collects. It‚Äôs very simple to clean, with just a couple pieces to remove. The self cleaning feature definitely helps to get the roller clean, and it only takes 40 seconds. I‚Äôve used this vacuum for a couple of weeks and I‚Äôm really hoping it lasts because I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd live without it at this point. The only improvement I could really foresee is when you charge it, you must plug the cord into the vacuum. I was thinking when you set it on the dock, it would charge, but that is not the case. For this price though, that‚Äôs a very small detail I can live without.",4
Darbes,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just meh. Not worth the hype.,the United States,13-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I had such high hopes for this. I‚Äôve tried to love it but if I were still in the return window it would be going back. In theory it sounds nice to just have to dump the dirty water but it clogs drains if you dump it completely so you‚Äôre stuck draining some water then using your hands to remove hair and debris from gross water into your bin. I‚Äôd much prefer just dry vacuuming and not having to dig gunk out of smelly dirty water then mopping vs the two in one this offers. The clean water won‚Äôt come out half the time until I use spot clean so it kills the battery as well. Just not really impressed unfortunately. And ofcourse it doesn‚Äôt get close enough to walls and baseboards so you‚Äôve got to do those separately anyways. It‚Äôs also nasty to clean. Aside from just dumping the tank it takes a solid few mins to get into every crevice to clean and prevent odor. Just not worth the effort. On top of it all I‚Äôm really not convinced with the quality of their solution but I‚Äôm too afraid to use my own and damage the already iffy machine. I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again and wouldn‚Äôt keep it if I hadn‚Äôt paid for it.,One
nana,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON'T BUY!,the United States,6-May-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I liked the idea of cordless however the battery life is only 20 minutes at best. Has no edge cleaner so it does not come close to walls at least an inch away. If you have a small room or a quick clean up its ok however anything more and you would be wasting your money. Not worth the price. I found it impossible to get replacement brushes even from the distributor. I bought this in April and have taken very good care of it but as of  October 8 it no longer works.

I‚Äôve got two shedding dogs and a ten month old baby so you can imagine the mess around the house. And yes it really is picking everything up and moping. People complained about the debris and dirty water being in one place but honestly it hasn‚Äôt been a problem. The water comes out and the debris stays to the back and I just go dump it in the trash.

I can‚Äôt think of what it‚Äôs actually useful for. Maybe immediate spills. But it‚Äôs so light duty that it‚Äôs Inefficient to actually use as a mop alternative. You have to keep going over the same area multiple times to clean it up. Then the water overflows and leaves trails of dirty water. The container is so small it fills quickly. Our kitchen has white tile so I could see the lack of progress. I could have mopped the the whole house the amount of time it took me to clean one small area. It also smells bad because the roller stays wet in an enclosed space. The dirty water container needs to be cleaned and filter sponge dried completely before you can reassemble or it will retain odor like the roller brush. I don‚Äôt have time for all of this extra work. Mop, bucket, soap, 2 min per space  and my floor is clean. Live and learn. This is a toy.

Read my full review for helpful tips.,the United States,11-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Backstory: bought a house that I couldn‚Äôt walk barefoot in because previous owners wore shoes indoors, gross.Bought this item because of the reviews and I love it! I can finally walk around barefoot without my feet leaving footprints when o get in the shower.Things to note:It‚Äôs not highlighted as a feature but the hinge point is a ball joint so it can pivot not only front and back but also side to side for more mobility into tight spaces.Slightly underfill the clean water tank because even without reaching max capacity on the dirty water tank it can lose suction if it‚Äôs too full or it is moved about aggressively.Cleaning solution is optional, I find hot tap water does a remarkable job and leaves absolutely no residue.Make a pass or two with the top button depressed (spray) and then one or more passes without holding it to just use just the vacuum function. (This is suck up more moisture and cut down the drying time).A quick sweep before mopping will limit hair and debris that goes into the tank and will make flushing the dirty water a more viable option.As instructed remove the agitator to allow it to air dry but also pop both the dirty and clean water canisters open and air dry between uses to make sure that it‚Äôs fresh for the next time you use it.",2

I can clean my floors better with a dust rag mop. This does not get within an inch of an edge. It doesnt touch edges and leaves a grease streak two inches around the edge of the room. It sprays out two tiny trails of cold water. it takes several passes over to smooth out the two trails back to a shine. I tried this yesterday and made it through like two rooms before losing my mind. I havent even cleaned it yet bc I was too pissed. I want to clean it to send it back but Im still pissed at it lol.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes life easier,the United States,25-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Of course I was skeptical. I was previously cleaning my floors with a shark mop, and I thought they were clean then.. I‚Äôve used this for about a month at this point, every 2-3 days because we have a high traffic kitchen. I always think my floors are clean because they don‚Äôt appear dirty but this thing proves me wrong every time. I use the solution that came with it and hot water in the water tank and by the time I‚Äôm done with two bathrooms, our front door entry way, and the kitchen the water comes out super dark and dirty. I tend to go over the floors twice to make sure I‚Äôm not missing anything and I do have to refill the water tank and dump the dirty tank at least once. I also no longer have to sweep before mopping because it vacuums everything up, although I do pick up big debris first. My son spilled ice cream with m&m chunks in it and I used this mop to clean the mess and it did fantastic! To me, it cleans so well that even if I had more tile or a bigger house it would still be worth it to empty/fill multiple times. I only have two minor complaints about it, more like wishes. I wish the brush was a bit more rough, had more bristles so it would scrub the floor harder. My other wish is that it would clean closer to the edges of the walls, there tends to be a 1 inch (roughly) gap between the clean spot and the wall because the machine itself is wider than the actual mop/brush area. It‚Äôs not really a problem for me as I have an electric scrubber that I use for these spaces, but it would be an improvement to this machine if that weren‚Äôt the case. Overall I am 98% happy with this machine and definitely would recommend it to anyone with tile or hardwood!",

The first one, the roller brush that washes the floor seemed to have been mounted too high. The roller brush didn't even touch the floor so there was no way it could clean the floor. I sent it back.  I got a replacement. It worked wonderfully the first two times I used it. Now the water barely dribbles out, so the roller doesn't get wet. After I go over the floor, it is completely DRY. I'm sending this back and getting a different brand.

It cleaned up all of the messes of every day life with a toddler; however, after using it i notices the suction power going down (even though it was fully charged). the last time i used it i picked it up and it shot out EVERYTHING i had vacuumed up. i looked, there was no clog. It takes a while to get the floors wet. I would just have to sit there. Then, there's the cleaning. You have to clean it EVERY time you use it. You must take the brush off, hand pull the hair and stuff off. It is DISGUSTING. Then, after all the cleaning, it STILL smells like stale water. i let it air out for like a month and it still stinks. Its AWFUL. I would not recommend this model. Maybe they have fixed it in other models, but this one is just time consuming and not worth it.",One
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent for the price,the United States,29-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"While I do like the tineco Ifloor and use it daily there are a few things that I wish I would of known before purchase. The spray function doesn't seem to work consistently. Sometimes it seems to spray alot others it seems to barely wet the floor regardless of how full the water is or how fast you are moving. The vaccum head is a little taller then I would of thought so it doesn't fit under chairs, sofas, fridges etc and your left with having to sweep under them to avoid spots of pet hair. The suction and brush also don't go to the edge and there's about an inch and a quarter on each side that doesn't have either so it doesn't get up against walls or trim well. Ive started sweeping out from under and along things before so that isn't as much of a problem anymore.. If you have alot of dogs and pet hair like me it tends to blow it away from the sides so the further along you get the bigger the pile next to you.",One
Candy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh...,the United States,29-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this...but I dont.  It was either this or the Crosswave, and I wish i bought the crosswave.I do like that its cordless. That part is nice and convenient if your just using it for quick sand or dirt on the floor.  Good suction.But when you start using water/cleaner--It barely spits out any water. Its annoying. I tried moving it every which way and seeing if maybe more would come out, but it doesnt.  But when you mix the water and the dirt, and in my house--hair from me and the dogs--- the container is so little it fills quickly with ""mud"" almost-- and you have to stop and clean it out alot. Then after every use you have to clean the whole dang thing if you dont want nastiness to stick in there.  The ""self cleaning"" part only cleans the brush.  But even then--not really.It didnt ""clean"" my floors like I thought it would. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I was hoping to have more water come out, and to actually see a difference in the clean of my floor, instead of just ""yes, it picked up misc debris"".  Iif I could return it without having to disassemble it, I would. Its too much work all together to get the kind of result I was hoping for, and clean up is a chore.I probably just need to get a mop and go old school. This just wasnt for me I guess.",
Kaitlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mom's of humans or animals buy this!,the United States,25-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So I almost returned this thing after using it a couple times. It would be working just fine then it would spit out dirty water and I'd get so annoyed! Then I went on YouTube and saw a video from vacuum wars and at the end they went over how when the dirty water has reached max capacity the vacuum would change it's tone (like it's in over drive or something) and then dirty water would start coming out. Silly me thinking I could do my whole house with just filling up the clean water once. I noticed I could do a large room or two small rooms before I'd need more water and to empty the dirty water. Which with my swifter, I'd change the pad around the same time.Is it perfect? No. I will still have to actually mop once in a while because it doesn't do well in corners or against the walls.But is it worth it? To me 100% yes. I am a stay at home mom/college student and have 3 children, a husband, and a large dog. It definitely saves me time. Most days I'd sweep at LEAST 3 times and then if I had the energy at the end of the day swifter. But to be honest half the time I didn't because I knew as soon as I did a kid would spill something. With this it is so much easier to keep the floors clean! I use it as my broom throughout the day here and there. And if a kid spills something I run the mop feature over it quickly. Then at the end of the day just run it and in less than 20 minutes my floors are clean. No sweeping then swiftering and bending over a million times. Then I run the self clean feature, clean all the compartments, and put it on the charger for the next day.",

Evagirl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,9-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really like this mop/Vac . Things i love 1) It is quiet! i can even do floors when baby is sleeping right outside his door and not wake him. 2) Lightweight! Super easy to move around, pick up etc. 3) i am satisfied with how well the machine cleans the floor.  The only thing i knocked a star for is the streaks, it does leave streaks that are VERY noticeable on my hardwoods. However i know the floor is clean and that is enough for me to be somewhat okay with and still recommend the machine.",5
The Blonde Avenger,1.0 out of 5 stars,"20 months in: not durable, cannot get parts, service is a joke",the United States,16-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've owned this product for 22 months and I would not buy it again.  First of all, it was relatively expensive compared to other products--I paid $214 for it and that was the price at the time.  (When you can get a great carpet shampooer for $185, something is wrong--this product is not very complicated.)I did like that it was cordless and fairly lightweight.  It kept a charge for a decent amount of time.  The downsides:  1.  the replacement mop head and other spare parts (sponge filter) were never in stock so you are stuck with the original parts.  2.  at the 14 month mark it stopped dispensing cleaning solution.  Customer service is a joke.  They told me to clean the heads (duh) and when I advised that did not fix the problem, they told me they wanted to see ""a video of the product not dispensing the fluid,"" even after I offered to pay to ship it to them for repair. GMAFB, as if I have a film crew at my disposal.  How about just standing behind your product?  3.  I've been living with it and dispensing floor cleaner myself out of a  squeeze bottle but unfortunately now, at the 20 month mark, it's just spewing dirty water everywhere and not sucking it up.I see there is a newer version of this product that is now $300.  After dealing with these jokers and not being able to get parts for the product, no thank you.  I'm going to purchase a Bissell next.",
Tori,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,the United States,21-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this for my hardware floors and my small 1,000 square ft home. The first couple times it worked great. Then all the problems started. The battery doesn‚Äôt hold a charge. It constantly needs to be self cleaned. I have a roomba and do my floors to get the big stuff first. The suction power has gone down hill terribly. It leaves streaks as well as dirty water puddles.

Summer Sky,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Isn't it supposed to CLEAN the floors, not throw up on them??",the United States,27-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I waited, hoping this thing would do the job, but after several months, I can say that it just plain doesn't.  No matter how many times I set it on ""self clean,"" all it does after a couple of sweeps is to dump dirt back on the floor and require me to sponge up after it. It only took eight weeks before the dispenser didn't work properly so I had to provide my OWN water/cleaning solution via a paper cup, and my hand continually aches trying to pound the ""dirty water"" container back into the machine.  I guess the moral of the story is that there's no beating a good old fashioned mop!!Update: well, the company is doing everything it can to not replace the product.  They reluctantly agreed - after I think the third of fourth person I spoke to; the first barely spoke English - and now we're at a standoff because they want me to return the item before they send me another.  At issue??  The box.  I don't have a box, and they know it.  I thought they would send me a functioning wet vac and I'd return the old in the same box, but apparently, that's too simple.Thee reason why I'm skeptical of reviews that people issue a few days after an item's receipt is that longevity is a serious component in evaluating  a product, and this thing hasn't lasted even a year  This company's customer service is lousy.  These are things the consumer needs to know before purchasing an expensive product.  Oh, and the way, I overpaid. Oh well.  It's actually funny!!",2
Melissa C.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,the United States,24-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Expensive for something that works medicore. I've looked at a lot of vacuum mops and decided on this one that best fits my budget but I don't think it was worth it. I paid $175 at the time. It's supposed to make my life easier and not a hassle. I have a lot of hardwood floors and tile and the vacuum suction is not very powerful (almost the same as my $15 dirt devil vacuum)  and the mopping is just about the same as a wet jet swiffer if not worse sometimes.  If would be fine if it works consistently every time without having to throughly clean the whole vacuum and parts every single time. If the vacuum isn't immaculately clean it doesn't work. I have many steps to assemble before I even mop the floor. You have to fill up the solution in warm water, make sure all hairs and filter is dry and cleaned before putting it altogether for another run. I have had dirty water regurgitate out when the dirty water tank wasn't full nor did I overfill the cleaning solution tank. the I guess it's hard to find a good vacuum mop that has power and is wireless. Not to mention run time is something else to consider if you have a bigger house. It's takes a long time to recharge.Maybe this might work well for someone with an apartment or small house but it did not work for me.",
Cici,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant product,the United States,7-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this. I bought it on a whim after seeing an advertisement for a similar one by Bissel. It comes with everything you need (charger, attachment to hold brushes, cleaning tool, tray, and cleaning product!) It is surprisingly light and cleans floors well without leaving behind a ton of water. I have laminate flooring and have found that when I use a regular mop, no matter how much I wring it out, there‚Äôs always way too much water and I can see spots where the floor is lifting. This is fast, easy to use and best part of all, IT SELF CLEANS. You hold down the on/off button and it cleans the brush and spins it till it is almost dry. This is the gadget I didn‚Äôt know I needed, but seriously cannot live without.Pros:InexpensiveComes with cleaner solutionSelf cleaningEasy to useLightweightRechargeable (no batteries needed)Cons:Not made for carpet (I‚Äôve tried on low pile rugs with some success, but this is definitely not a carpet cleaner)Storage - because it needs to be plugged in, you won‚Äôt be able to hide it away in a closet",One
missy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected... But great customer service!,the United States,1-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"**Update** so I will say that it grew on me. Even though it doesn't deep deep clean the floors, it's a great daily maintenance. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I've now had it for roughly 3 months and it's no longer working properly though. It's not squirting out water half the time. I believe it's a button issue. I reached out to customer service and got a response the same day with awesome customer service. I'm about to ship it off to be repaired (covered under 2 year warranty!) So kudos to them for great customer service so far! ***Not really impressed. It was ok but not what I was expecting. I have a very busy home. Two kids (8 and 2), two dogs, and a mechanic husband all who are all in and out all day long. I sweep and mop my floors multiple times a day. I was hoping this would cut down on my clean time but sadly it didn't. This definitely isn't for high traffic homes.Pros: I loved physically seeing the dirt that came off the floor being poured down my drain instead of pushed around like a regular mop. Easy assembly and it's definitely easier on your back...but that's about itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èCons: battery life sucks! I fully charged it before use and it died right at the very end of doing my living room/kitchen area. (Open floor plan) The tank is TINY!!!! I had to stop and empty/fill up the tanks about 6 times doing my kitchen living room area. (Its a big room but not that big..)Even though I physically seen the dirt it got up. (And I will say it got up some dirt!!!) I still felt the need to mop my floors again with a regular mop afterwards. It was clean but not to this mamas standards clean.Maybe I was just expecting something not really possible. I probably won't keep this. Its definitely for someone with a lower traffic home.

Hannah J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good. But a pain to clean.,the United States,24-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So, I love this guy. It works really well, although my first one was defective, this is so super convenient! I love that it is cordless, I feel like I can keep my floors maintained nicely and it never takes but a few minutes to dry up. My complaint is the cleanup. If you mop with it even a LITTLE bit then you need to fully clean the device. The whole thing smells like rotting sewage if you leave it for even a couple hours. I have to use dish soap and hot water to clean and it still smells faintly. You can‚Äôt use the self cleaning function and walk away. I do use that, then mop up what dribbled out while it did that (because it does) and then wash it thoroughly and leave the parts out to air dry. So I rarely use it more than once a day. It is still faster than grabbing my heavy vacuum and then my mop to do the same areas again. The one and done is so nice! But I feel like there should be a better way to clean it without having to soak the brush head, clean the cover, clean the traps, the filter, the passages, the reservoirs and the little connections. It is a lot. Also‚Ä¶ this is not a deep cleaning machine. This is a perfect replacement for items like a swiffer (which do absolutely nothing). This is a surface clean only. It does wonderfully for that. I use a sanitizing wet mop with specialized pads to actually deep clean. This picks up tracked in leaves and mud and grass and cleans up spilt drinks and craft messes from my kids.",
Ali,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not a deep clean but a light clean,the United States,11-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is not a replacement for floor scrubbing, but definitely does help with the upkeep! I am so happy I ordered this. The mop brush roll does a very gentle cleaning, so if you have anything dried on the floor, it probably won‚Äôt come up with this. Definitely does not clean grout. HOWEVER‚Äî I have two young children and they make a mess at every single meal. This mop vac makes it so easy to clean up after them, especially if they get anything sticky on the floor. Yesterday, my 5 year old spilled an entire cup of lemonade on the floor. I just pulled out this mop vac and sucked it all up, then went back over it with the soap solution included mixed with tap water. It was SO EASY!!! If you‚Äôre needing something to help keep your floors clean in between deep cleanings, this product is awesome. The mop brush roll self-cleans and it‚Äôs all so easy to clean between uses. If you have a lot of hard flooring, I would upgrade to the ifloor3 because this one has less water capacity, less battery time, and you have to hold the trigger down if you want the water/cleaner to come out. My house has mostly carpet, so I only needed this for the kitchen and bathrooms. It‚Äôs perfect for me.",
R H,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price ... short lived functionality.,the United States,1-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have had this product for about a year now. Overall, I would not recommend purchasing this product. Maybe at a much cheaper price it would be beneficial for short-term use in a small space.The performance is sub-standard. The clean and dirty reservoirs are small. However, this was perfect for my small apartment. The issue is that you can only fill the dirty reservoir half way before it starts to leak. I prefer to use the spot clean function during my entire use, as it generally cleans better.After about 8 months the functionality started to decline; the cleaner picked up less dirty water. At 11 months, in addition to picking up less dirty water, it leaks the dirty water it does pick up. Also, the cleaning brush that is included broke during a scrub on the dirty reservoir.",One

Once I reached my hall it started leaving puddles everywhere. I then noticed it even spit out clumps of dog hair/dirt on my walls!  I got to my bathroom where the floor was white and it was just a mess. It wasn't sucking up any water what so ever.I stopped and cleaned the machine and decided to take a wet paper towel to my kitchen floor that had dried and was left with a bunch of dirt still.

I was certain it was going to make my life easier.  When I got it I followed instructions and started cleaning / vacuuming my floors, I filled the water recepticle and after about 7-8 minutes it started leaking dirty water.  I was confused and thought, well maybe the bottom receptible that fills up with the dirty water was full, but it wasn't. So I thought, ok, I need keep on changing out the water more frequently.  Then I charged the unit and it shut off after 2 mins, I thought maybe it was loose, tried it again for 2 consecutive days.  It turns off.  I feel I may have gotten a rebuilt one due to the discounted promo Amazon  Day price, or a damaged one.Really disappointed.  Also side note, when using it cannot go close enough to the wall, there will always  be like a half inch gap, that is a real problem because that's where a lot of dust builds us.  Just something to consider.  The cleaner that also comes with it leaves a film, I tried a tiny amount to see if it was different, but not still left a film.",

Emily Morrison,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not perfect, but still good.",the United States,17-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I enjoy this product because it makes cleaning my hardwoods every week way easier. Before I swept and used a regular mop and found that no matter how well I thought I swept, there was always still hair and dirt left behind, and the mop just pushed it around.This product eliminates this problem. I still sweep first, but anything I miss is picked up now.A few downsides and things to note:I recommend cleaning it out after each room you do. It gets funked up pretty quick and will sometimes spit out dirty water if it gets too bad, and that defeats the purpose. It has a bit of a learning curve.Hair and dirt got caught in one of the tiny front wheels and now it is stuck. If I'm not careful it will sometimes scuff the floor.I didn't care for the cleaning solution it came with, so I use a different one.Other than that, this product has proven very useful, and I love finishing the job and feeling like my floors have actually been cleaned.",One

W.C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,It made my life easier and my tile floor cleaner.,the United States,8-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"First of all, I use this wet/dry vacuum cleaner with my robot to clean the tile floors. I made sure that my floor are first cleaned with the robot so I don't have to deal with the larger debris in the dirty water tank.The conclusion is I did the right decision to buy this iFloor.What I really like:1. Cordless and the battery last long enough for me to clean my kitchen floor2. It picks up the dirt and grind pretty well. My first water is as dark as mud water. That means it works well.3. Not too loud4. The price is fair enough5. Good design to easily remove the tanks and brush. It looks great too.6. I use the glass cleaner (GV brand from Walmart-the refill size) with (RO) water (1:5) to make sure that it leave no streaks. The solution is cheap and very effective to clean my tiles.7. The way I clean is the cross passing pattern. Apply solution from North to South then pickup the liquid from East to West. It came out perfect.What I think it should do better or have more options:1. I know that the brush that comes with the machine should not scratch the wood floor. I prefer something that scrub more. The brush is not hard enough to scrape the dirt stick on my tiles.2. I want an easier way to clean the brush. It looks nasty after my first use.3. Need 30% Larger tanks4. I would prefer to have the magnet connector or the charger that attach to the base so I don't have to manually plug or unplug the cord.5. Removable battery, so I can have a spare for the larger area as I mop when I have time. Sometime, I have more time to mop but the battery will not last to cover the entire floor.#TINechoBack",One

Mostly when I want to buy something like a vaccume cleaner or duster i want it to at least suck up the dust bunnies and dirt and not just make a noise.

sld1025,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but tedious clean up,the United States,7-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This works really well, is not too loud and I love that it's cordless. However, the clean up afterwards is a total pain (major PITA). First, you need to take apart and wash all these pieces, before AND after cleaning of the brush roll. Then these pieces have to dry between cleanings. Clearly whoever designed this didn't think about the fact that the end user is likely someone who is the main caretaker of the house, and may have kids and/or a job. In other words, lots of things to do and needs cleaning tools that are fast and efficient (and don't require such a tedious clean up process).What I dislike the most about this is when I dump out the dirty water, I need to separate out the gunk that gets vacuumed up to avoid clogging up the drain, and this part is really gross. With a regular vacuum, I just dump the dust/hair/crumbs into the trash without touching any of it. With this, I obviously can't dump it in the trash because of the water, but it can't all down the sink either, so I need to use my hand to take out the gross wet soggy debris.",

I was surprised it didn‚Äôt die on me because usage time is 22 minutes and I was taking my time as well as trying to figure out how to use it. It doesn‚Äôt make it clear but you have to hold down the water button for it to both mop and vacuum, it isn‚Äôt a switch you can turn on and leave on like the vacuum part by itself is. Anyways I would recommend 10/10- I have that fake wood tile flooring. This at minimum cut my cleaning time in half by not having to vacuum then mop separately. I plan to use this often so my floor doesn‚Äôt get the way it was. My only regret is not buying this product sooner. I‚Äôm so thankful to have this product with a toddler and another baby coming as well as the dog and a husband who cares for them but doesn‚Äôt pay attention to what they all drag in!I honestly don‚Äôt see how a vacuum mop could work better than this one other than adding time it can run or having a larger clean and dirty water tank that needs to be emptied less.",One
Megan Lauhon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected but...,the United States,1-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"To be fair, I had VERY high hopes for this vacuum. The first time I used it I was actually a bit disappointed. It turned out to be a better vacuum than I had anticipated but the mop half was less impressive. I will definitely be keeping the ol' reliable spin mop as this little tineco isn't good at deep cleaning. There were a few spots in the kitchen for instance, some jam that had dried overnight, that it couldn't clean up (it hardly made a dent). I ended up using a paper towel and a spray bottle to get the tougher spots up. After a few uses however, I realized this vacuum fills a different niche entirely. For day to day maintenance its so much better and faster than just a broom or swiffer. I can vacuum the common areas just as quickly as I could with our bulky Dyson and the mop feature does a much better job getting up dirt. So the take away is, keep your mop and regular vacuum as this won't replace them but if you're interested in having a combo device for spot cleaning/in-between cleaning this is for you. I have learned to love this device despite my initial disappointment and it seems to be very well constructed.",
Halosnhippos,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works better than my other ways of mopping but not as good as I hoped,the United States,24-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I bought this because I'm always on the floor trying to scrub up spots that regular mopping or steam mopping doesn't get.  I thought this would do it...it doesn't. The spots I went over are still there.  Now since it's cordless it works way faster than my steam mop I was always having to unplug from one spot and plug into another.  And it's faster than regular mopping.  It dries faster than both those as well.  It's hard to get under the table because if you angle the handle too low the water dumps out.  It definitely pulled up some dirty water though.  I also had to refill the clean water tank and empty the dirty one once during cleaning the downstairs.  The battery never ran out though.  It actually say it's quieter than my steam mop.  It's night and light weight  I likely would not have bought it if I knew it wouldn't get my spots up since that was the main reason I purchased it.  However I'm still fairly pleased with it as it is easier than the other ways I've mopped before .,
KC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Works great when it works!,the United States,28-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Unit worked great for the first few uses but that was short lived. Now the unit will only run for a few seconds and turn itself off.  I called customer service and we ran the troubleshooting checklist,  the unit tested bad and Tineco informed me that they we send out a new unit. I researched for several days watching YouTube reviews and many other internet reviews to include Amazon. I narrowed it down to the Bissell Crosswave and this unit.  This unit works well when it works,  but it only lasted for a few weeks and then malfunctioned. I hope this was just a faulty unit and not representative of the ifloor reliability. Customer service was very helpful,  however it will take a few weeks to replace unit. I will review the new unit after several uses.",5
Cheryl Tuning,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally,the United States,4-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have used a lot of ‚Äònon-mop‚Äô options because I have never been happy using any traditional mop. This works the best of all other options. I do a quick sweep to get the big stuff, then run this on the floors. I do clean it well afterwards since we have 4 cats and a dog.The hair comes out of the return tank easily, the roller bar cleans up quickly, but I do lift the machine to the sink to rinse all the hair out of the pathway to the return tank.Not much water is used in relation to floor size so the floor does dry pretty fast. The noise level is way below my vacuum. You can whatever cleaner you prefer. My hardwood floors don‚Äôt have a filmy look to them like they do with swifter cleaning or regular mop.I‚Äôve had no issues with operating the cleaner. It‚Äôs reliable and since I charge each time I use it, it‚Äôs always ready to go.The hardwood floor size in my home totals to about 650 sq feet and I‚Äôve been able to clean all of it without needing to recharge.",
Presto,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little floor cleaner!,the United States,10-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was really impressed by how well this little cleaner worked on my floors.  Granted, I've only used it a couple of times, but so far, it's been great.  The good reviews are true.  It has plenty of suction (especially on ""spot clean"" setting, which I recommend for all floor work) and can clean a small room like a kitchen with one tank of clean water.  It was amazing how dirty the water was that was picked up.  It even vacuums small stuff like crumbs and pet hair, but the pet hair is more difficult to remove during cleaning afterwards, so I recommend vacuuming the floor first.  It is really easy to charge, but like many new rechargeable devices lately, the plug is on the side rather that articulated with the base (which would have been better and more convenient).  This might have caused an issue with the moisture near the base, so probably best as is.  Charging is nice; the ""breathing"" light turns solid blue when done and then turns off indicating full charge (about 2 hours after a moderate amount of cleaning).Operation is really nice.  Light weight and quiet, it does a great job of leaving my tile floor spotless; even got up a stubborn stain that had been difficult to remove before with a mop.  It has a little overfill valve that blocks suction when the dirty water tank gets full; appreciated.  I noticed that the amount of water in the clean water tank is just enough more than the dirty that when the CWT is empty, the DWT is full.  Handy.  This isn't going to do a large space in one tank, but you should be able to refill and empty several times on a single charge.Clean up is a breeze, but as I said above, pet fur is not easy to get out without water shooting through the pick up passage.  The brush roll comes out easily (very much like a paint roller) and is easy to clean.Overall very happy with my purchase and will update later if problems develop.",
Brittney,4.0 out of 5 stars,4/5 stars,the United States,25-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really like this vacuum overall. It makes cleaning so easy with my two muss. I love that it is cordless and that it vacuums and mops at the same time. Takes an extra cleaning step away from me! I do notice that juts very streaky while using so I‚Äôm not getting a uniform water distribution. It also doesn‚Äôt clean everything well. It cleaned up dirt and small marks but I still had leftover handprints and baby snacks left untouched. I like how convenient it is so I‚Äôm not returning but it‚Äôs also not the best at cleaning.,2
rachel lafontaine,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sincerely Bummed,the United States,10-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"If you like a deep clean on your wood floors, do not buy this product. Maybe I had too high of expectations because I‚Äôm used to a steam mop clean and this didn‚Äôt come close. The suction was very weak and seemed to push dust around instead of sucking it up. It definitely doesn‚Äôt get in any corners or edges of the floors. Then the mop basically just tickled the floor. I pressed the water dispenser button and held it down and barely got any water to come out, unless I pressed the spot button which gave me way too much water. Then it leaves terrible streaks as other reviews have stated as well. The only good thing I‚Äôll say is that it was cordless and light weight. Can‚Äôt wait to get this out of my house and go back to the steam mop cleaning. I had such high hopes for this to save time.",2
Khaaa,2.0 out of 5 stars,Would not buy again.,the United States,1-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt clean as well as I thought it would. At all. I guess it‚Äôs easier than sweeping them mopping. But doesn‚Äôt really save time. You have to take the entire thing apart every time you use it or it will smell HORRIBLE like mildew. Dump both water tanks, take off roller and cover and rinse, take out filter and rinse. Then have to leave it all in pieces while it dries so the thing can charge. Which drives me crazy because we just have wet mop pieces sitting out to dry all the time. Cant even leave the filter in overnight for use next day. It only cleans up wet messes well. Does not clean dirt or anything dry unless you go over it a hundred times.",One
Amber,2.0 out of 5 stars,Mom of 4 honest review! Its a waste of money,the United States,20-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing was all the rave in 2020. I begged for xmas. It was my 1 wish item and I got it. I regret asking for it and returning it.I cannot figure out how so many people like it. I have 4 kids aged 13, 11, 10 and 7 and an english mastiff. There is hair, crumbs, dog drool, and sticky stuff all over my floor. Once a month I get on my hands and knees and scrub like cinderella. This is not saving me time,money, or effort.It doesnt clean the grout (i assumed it would scrub the grout enough to clean it a little). Sometimes when I use it, i pull the trigger  and 3 passes later, the water is gone. And then another time i can do my entire kitchen and realize it hasnt used ANY water, despite me trying. Im 5'5"" tall and the instructions state not to lay it down more that 45¬∞. Maybe my arm lays it down more than that and cuts the flow of water? I dunno, i cant make myself taller.It leaves water in the grout of my tile floor, unable to suck it out completely. Qnd the cleaning power isnt great. My dog drools when she drinks. So after about a week, the spots where shes dribbled water get some dust build up. It takes 5 or 6 passes to even begin to clean it up.It can take me upwards of 30 minutes just to clean half my kitchen floor, then plug it in and get on my hands and knees to clean the rest.Total waste.",One
Sunny,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not live up to the hype...,the United States,11-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Unfortunately, this product has made cleaning my floors twice as hard as they ever were. The water does not spray out properly, does not suck the water up properly and leaves behind a mess and steaks, the suction is not good, even when engaging the spot function, it doesn't get the job done, cannot get within a couple inches next to walls or trim, have to go through a whole cleaning process of the machine after every use and it is very temperamental. Very disappointed because the advertisement really made it seem great. I've had it for about a month and will be returning it.

Hannah Williams,1.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted to love this,the United States,25-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to love this. I was so hoping it would simplify my mopping process. I looked at countless reviews and videos comparing it to other similar products. When I bought it I was excited!.... Then I used it. The first couple of times I figured it was me, maybe I just hadn't gotten the hang of it. I pre-sweep before using this but it still ends up leaking dirty water all over my floor unless I take it apart and clean everything with every use. By the time I've swept my floor twice and stopped halfway through mopping to clean out both tanks and remove and clean the roller I may as well have just used my old mop and gone over it twice like I used to.",One
Felix Felicis,4.0 out of 5 stars,8/10 would buy again,the United States,9-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Love this little vacuum, I have 2 young boys and they are constantly spilling things, tracking in mud, etc and this cleans up all of it no problem. Today I've ""mopped"" the kitchen floors with it, vacuumed up spilled wet nuts (don't ask), and ""mopped"" the hardwood floor after Mac n cheese was spilled then eaten by the dog. And as much as I use it I only charge it every 2-3 days. Great value for the price.Only cons are that I think it's weird that all the water and other debris goes into one chamber, so I'm constantly dumping filthy water down the drain and the drain catch is always full of pet hair and gross debris I'd rather not have to deal with.Also I have 2 dogs and the hair often clogs the screen inside where the debris goes instead of falling to the bottom of the chamber and filling it up like normal. So then I have to empty it more often than I normally would to pull the hair off the screen.But overall it's a great little vacuum and I would buy it again.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean the Sponge & it will be Perfect!,the United States,18-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I use this at least once a week now, and I can say I never knew how much I needed this until I had it. Cleaning is so much easier and more efficient, and it gets up more dirt than I could imagine was ever on the floor. I clean the sponge and dirty water tank with diluted Fabuloso each time I use it, and it helps a lot, too. Otherwise, even cleaning the machine with strong soap can leave a bit of a stale smell after cleaning the floor.

I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS VACUUM... But I have mixed reviews on it. Its a great vacuum for my hardwood and tiled bathrooms. Its a good mop for when my 7 year old thinks she has to spill her drink 3-5 times a week, and for when my 8 month old puppy decides to potty in the house, or for when my Thanksgiving disaster happened and I dropped my non baked pecan pie all over the floor (it did its job, I had to empty it a few times and pour more water on the ground to help it out a little because pecan pie is extremely sticky) BUT....... its not getting my dogs paw prints off my floor, I have 2 goldendoodles who love to run around outside and find the dirt to dig in (hate that they do that) so when they come in with wet dirty paws I needed this vacuum to be amazing and its just not for this particular cleaning. Im annoyed, so having to use my wetjet to get the prints up and Tineco for the everyday little jobs or big. But it does help me to actually want to mop my floors everyday. It cleans itself and does a really good job at it and charges quickly. I go between Tineco cleaner that came with it and my Thieves cleaner.",

Stephanie Saunders,1.0 out of 5 stars,Opposite of a Time Saver// Not worth the hype!!!!!,the United States,8-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have a small 2 bedroom apartment and I mainly wanted to use this in my living room where it is all hardwood floors. Instructions and assembly was easy. I vacuumed prior with my dyson just to get any access dog hair. Using the devise is easy, but the reason I am returning the item is because I had to refill and empty every 3 minutes. I did use the spot cleaner setting for some areas but I didn‚Äôt see anything that ‚Äúwowed‚Äù me. I even did a wipe test afterwards and the napkin was a noticeable dirt color. If you leave your vacuum standing upright while you refill, a big puddle forms from the brush. Stick to the mop and broom. Not worth the hype!!!!!",2
Book lover,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't get corners and too much trouble to use for the results you get,the United States,4-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I REALLY wanted to like this because I thought it would make cleaning a houseful of laminate and real wood floors easier. It doesn't. Gave it 2 stars because it does vacuum and clean as promised. But since I have to vacuum all the throw rugs anyway, could just as easily do the rest of the floor. Also like the fact it runs on battery, no chord to deal with.It also doesn't get close to the walls, edges, etc., leaving about a 1# gap.It's a real pain to clean the machine too. Takes forever for all of the parts to dry out.Will be going back to the microfiber mop and cleaning spray. Can get in the corners, underneath furniture and actually takes less time.Might try it on the longer throw rugs that don't fit in the washer as some people have. Also might just use it to quickly vacuum up the dirt my dogs tend to bring in. Otherwise, it's a waste of money for me.",
Circeae,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love this, but...",the United States,1-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this thing. As someone else wrote, it is for very light duty spills. I didn't see much purpose in the spot cleaning button. It has good suction, but there is virtually no scrubbing capability. If I didn't immediately empty the used liquid, then it would leave some behind on the floor. After a few initial cleanings, it always smelled musty during cleaning, even with the solution, and with soaking the brush in vinegar. I ended up returning it, especially after they dropped the price $100.  I had some charging issues which may have turned out to be my outlet, but unconfirmed......but, after looking at the competitor options, pouring over reviews of multiple machines, and having to mop old school,  I decided this was the best option for my needs and for the cost (since reduced) and ordered another one.  I leave it taken apart to dry after each use, which is a little annoying, but still beats having to slop mop.  So I'm satisfied.",One
Maryh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Life Saver in the Kitchen,the United States,26-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really do enjoy using this mop/vacuum.. starting with the pros- this being cordless is my favorite part of the machine! The battery lasts nicely between uses and does not die as fast as I was expecting. It is quick and effective for spills and dropped crumbs on the floor, but with that being said... it does not do well with older spills or scuffs. It lifts spills and messes easily, but it is not very effective for deep cleaning messes that have sat or dried. The ‚Äòself cleaning mode‚Äô does partially work, but not as great as I was expecting. My only con is the smell/odor that the machine produces after being turned on. I have cleaned it after each use but it still does not have any effect on the odor. For the price it really is a great item! It works great for quick little clean ups, but is not the greatest when it comes to deep cleaning!

Normal vacuums with fling the litter around but I‚Äôve had no issues with it. It easy to clean the machine itself as well. It also seems that a little goes a long way with the cleaning product that comes with the machine.UPDATE: this product was great for the first few weeks and not it is literally trash. The mop will not squirt out water. The suction is awful around corners and wall edges. Yes I have cleaned the mop I‚Äôve made sure there was water to squirt out. It‚Äôs so much easier for me to just vacuum with my vacuum and mop with my steam mop. It‚Äôs also easier to dump the vacuum and wash the mop than it is to clean this mop. I do not recommend.,One

I liked it but it was very heavy and I hate cords. I wanted to try Hizero mop but it is way above my price range ,so I bought Tenaco Ifloor mop.Bottom line- I returned Bissel.I have two small kids ( 21 months and 6 month) , dog and 1,700 sq feet 2 floor house with only hardwood/ laminate/ bamboo and tile floors. No carpets. I can mop whole house on 1 regular charge ( not spot). It charges fast. I refill cleaning water and empty container while cleaning, which it is smaller than Bissel. I think it doesn't have great suction like Bussel but it cleans floors really well .For some reason I didnt receive cleaning solution, but I keep using solution thats for Crosswave.  I love the fact that it is cordless! Very convenient. However, it is not that quiet as advertised,but so much better that Bissel. My toddlers used to scream from panic when I used Crosswave, but he is totally fine when I mop floors with Ifloor.If you don't have carpet and like to safe time I think Ifloor is for you!",One
Barbara Evensen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Spend more and get a quality product,the United States,15-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We have three dogs so that means a lot of dog hair.  I wish we would have purchased the Bissell model which has separate tanks for liquid and dry matter.  This horrible product is awkward to use, allows the dry matter (in our case dust and dog hair) to mix with the liquid in the same container.  In order to use this vacuum without having to deal with a real mess, you need to completely dry vacuum the entire area first (and then empty the container) and then go over the entire area again with the spray feature.  Because of the placement of the spray trigger, it's almost impossible to do that.  The entire time you vacuum, you can't help but depress the spray trigger.  I suppose I could live with that but when the dog hair, dust and sand mixes with the liquid cleaner it's really gross to clean out and it takes no time for the entire thing to become completely clogged.  It's also difficult to not hit the on/off button while trying to vacuum.  Poorly designed and I really wish I hadn't purchased this.",
Garvin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"works well enough for the price, bumping into furniture is a problem",the United States,29-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this model as my husband is tired of my gadgets that talk which the other newer, more expensive ones do. I have cherry wood, top nail oak, and ceramic tile floors.I was hoping to combine the sweeping and mopping to save time. So far this machine does that and no steaks when the floors dry.Now the machine doesn‚Äôt vacuum enough nor mop well enough to reach the base boards (off about 1/2‚Äù) so I vacuum the corners first with another vacuum and will need to go on with a mop. This is fine since I have area rugs to vacuum first anyway.Another minor problem. If you run into furniture the corner of the brush lid tends to lift slightly. The machine makes a new noise but our kids just keep going. This means as you clean you leave more dirty water behind and then self cleaning doesn‚Äôt work well.  Push it back down and be careful.It is just okay on bathroom tile with hair in the floor. It doesn‚Äôt get all the hair, especially as it gets wet.Cat litter cleans up well but again, the machine doesn‚Äôt get close enough to the baseboards.",
RainMaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best invention ever!,the United States,28-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Where has this been my whole life?! I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could give this thing a negative review. Yes, you have to clean the roller and dump and rinse the dirty tank, but duh. Gross! Why WOULDN‚ÄôT you want to do that?! Ha. It‚Äôs way better to do that ONCE after you‚Äôre done with your whole floor than to have to mop 4 square feet and go rinse and clean and squeeze the mop about 20 times. Or, I guess you could just smear dirty mop water all over your floor from a mop bucket? (Which i will never understand. Blah!) Anyway... get this thing! Mop your whole floor. Pop out the roller and wash it. Dump the dirty water tank. Let dry. Pop it all back in. Voila. Recharge. And done. I mop all the time now instead of putting it off.

Kgeeze,3.0 out of 5 stars,You'll be satisfied if you have realistic expectations,the United States,18-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I think this dual purpose vacuum is great and generally gets the job done.If you're a clean freak  and want your floors completely spotless, you'll need a regular vacuum. It pretty much leaves an inch worth of debris around the perimeters of whatever you're cleaning no matter what you do (walls, uneven flooring, doorways, etc). Also, very important to note that it does NOT vacuum hair well. It may work with pet hair but anything longer than maybe 2 inches and itll get left behind or caught. Unlike a regular vacuum where you can just use an extension hose to clean areas like these, you're pretty much out of luck with the tineco. I think if you're looking for something to replace mopping though, this is pretty good. But for me personally, 1. I have long hair and 2. I want my floors SPOTLESS, so this will not replace a regular vacuum. Lastly, 22 minutes is actually a pretty short amount of time and even though I only have a one bedroom, I find that I really need to be concious of how long it's on for because I've definitely had it die on me (and it takes hours for it to fully recharge)",

Too much money to work for less than 2 years.UPDATE: contacted the manufacturer and they provided warranty service and fixed it. Was a hassle going through email to try to explain what was wrong. Seemed like a huge language barrier even over email.  Also finding a box it would fit in and taking it to fed ex. Although they fixed it and sent it back, it was a giant hassle.  I updated the stars to 3 because they fixed it, but for the hassle total stars remains 3. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product. I bought a Bissel Crosswave, so far it‚Äôs performing great.

It was out of stock for months and was extremely happy when it came back in stock on my birthday! It was meant to be, or so I thought.The first time using i was like ok maybe I'm doing something wrong but yet satisfied when I emptied the dirty canister and seeing how nasty it was. Ive used the ifloor 5 times now each time getting less satisfied.The suction of the vacuum aspect has met my standards but the 'mopping' üëéThe amount of water left on my floor with the streaking from the brush roller, the amount of times I have to empty the dirty water tank and fill the clean water tank is very annoying.I have tested my theory of the mopping side being sub-par. After using the ifloor on my laminate hardwoods I cleaned the dirty tank THEN ran the self clean cycle to see that the water is still clear. To me this says the scrubbing brush roller does nothing. This product spits water on your floor and sucks 60% of the liquid back up.Looks like I will go back to the old trusty bucket and a mop.",
Nicole F.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great wet mop!,the United States,11-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Great wet mop! I typically do a light sweeping before I mop, but it does pick up crumbs and pet hair left behind instead of just spreading it around. There‚Äôs a small learning curve though. If you put a little too much floor cleaner, then it will start to foam over and leak, so just be mindful of that. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like at first was it is a little louder than I expected and when rolling over ceramic tile, it doesn‚Äôt roll over it smoothly, which is understandable since it‚Äôs on plastic wheels. Also, the spot cleaner button doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything, but I could be wrong.  At first glance I did not think this mop would be up to the job as it is smaller and light weight, but it does a great job! I have yet to use it on my hard wood floors, but so far it does a great job on ceramic tile. It also is easy to maneuver into small spaces which is great! I love the self cleaning mode too! It really wrings out the mop roller and everything comes apart easily to clean. If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable, cordless wet mop look no further!",
Mare,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy Enough for Daily Use,the United States,22-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this to try after reading reviews. My FloorMate died so thought I'd try this for my tile floors. I still use my handheld stick brush to clean the grout because I have yet to find an affordable machine to do that. This little Tineco is easy enough to use daily, though, on the high traffic areas and I still have enough charge time to pick another area to ""keep up"" with things. This helps keep grout clean so won't have to do it often. Living in Florida with windows and doors open a lot lends to unseen stuff ""in the air"" (pollens?) landing on the floor so it's great I can now easily do it daily...quickly. The FloorMate was good, but heavy, took up more space, and was not good for daily use. Definitely recommend this for anyone who likes to keep tile floors at their best. We don't have wood or laminate floors anywhere so can't comment on those.",
skylar,3.0 out of 5 stars,High Maintenance...,the United States,23-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs okay. Definitely have to thoroughly clean after each and EVERY use or it will stink horribly. Have to pop the bristles out and clean very well and cut out any hair that has wrapped around it, clean out dirty water and rinse clean (so it doesn‚Äôt stink) and clean any dirt out of bottom where bristles go. If you get lazy and don‚Äôt clean it out once then the suction goes to crap and will have to deep clean whole thing. I use on my hardwood floor and I have dogs that shed. For every day cleaning it‚Äôs alright but not for deep cleaning and trying to get up dried liquids and such. I would say it‚Äôs more equivalent to a vacuum than a mop. High maintenance. If you have a bigger area to clean and use the deep clean button often (which requires more water) you will have to empty dirty water in the middle of cleaning because it does not hold much water. If you do not empty dirty water out before it reaches the ‚Äúfull‚Äù line it will spit out a bunch of nasty water out all over your floor. There‚Äôs no sound or anything to let you know when it is full so you will have to keep very close eye on it. It‚Äôs great that it‚Äôs cordless though.",
Julia Valentine,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don‚Äôt understand all of the positive reviews,the United States,10-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Overall this vacuum is not worth the price to me and is a pain to keep up with, I wish I just bought a regular vacuum and mop.I was going to originally give this vacuum 2-3 stars because it vacuums and mops alright if you clean it after every use, however the vacuum recently started to smell so I changed it to 1 star. I clean the vacuum after every use as well.This vacuum is way more maintenance and hassle than it‚Äôs worth for the price. Every time I vacuum and mop, I spend at least 20 minutes cleaning out the vacuum afterwards for my one bedroom apartment. Also long hairs get caught in the brush that I constantly cut it out which is usually wet, gross, and messy. It says it‚Äôs recommended for pets, however my cats like to kick litter everywhere and vacuuming and mopping it is a nightmare! When vacuuming the litter, I feel it kicking it back at my feet instead of picking it up, and when I mop it it makes a dirty water mixture that looks clean but dries not fully mopped and still dirty.Overall if you don‚Äôt want to spend so much time to clean this vacuum after cleaning your house, do not buy. You might be happier with a regular vacuum. Not worth the money.",
Abi,2.0 out of 5 stars,So disappointing. Not worth the price.,the United States,27-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I read the reviews and watched the comparison videos. I was so excited to get this item. What a freaking disappointment! I wouldn‚Äôt have minded the short battery life as I have a very small kitchen but seriously spent half the battery life over on spot on the floor. It sucks about as well as a dust buster. If this cost $80 it would be worth it, for $200 not so much. It runs out of clean water super fast and I had to refill twice for each cleaning. Third time I used it, it just wouldn‚Äôt charge. I couldn‚Äôt pack it up and send it back fast enough.",3
HHI,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work,the United States,21-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Although I didn't try to use this until October, when I unpacked it and tried to charge it, it wouldn't charge. After several emails with the company, including a requested video of the product as it was plugged in and not charging, they said they would send a new charger. as of this date I have not received the charger.",3
Lins,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Light, quiet, and powerful.  üòä",the United States,26-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It is a very lightweight, pretty quiet little machine that does a pretty good job cleaning my concrete floors.  My dogs bring in all kinds of dirt and mud, and there were muddy paw prints ALL OVER the place before I used this for this first time.  Suffice it say that there are no more paw prints or streaks of mud anywhere.  üòä  I used the ‚Äúscrub‚Äù feature a lot in my first cleaning and that really does cause the machine to go through the water SO much faster.  However, there is no doubt that using that feature causes the iFloor to clean better.  I will say that I did go through two rounds of cleaning solution and dirty water the first time I used it.  But, as stated my floors were FILTHY.  However, I do feel that if you‚Äôre cleaning a very large house, it will probably run out on you several times.  For me, it‚Äôs okay, because I have a small house, so I can get everything done with one or two rounds of cleaning solution.  And on that note, it did come with cleaning solution, and it only takes one capful of solution with water every time you fill the reservoir.  So it doesn‚Äôt require a ton of expensive solution, which I really appreciate.  And overall it‚Äôs pretty easy to clean up after you‚Äôre done.  You dump the dirty water and clean up a few components and voila.  Just like that it‚Äôs done.  It‚Äôs not as easy as dumping a bucket of dirty mop water, but it‚Äôs not some big chore either.  As for the battery: well I got my first full cleaning done with battery to spare.  A week later I pulled it out to do a light cleaning and the battery died halfway through.  So, ultimately I learned to recharge it after each use.  Which, of course, is no biggie!Overall, I recommend this product if you‚Äôre in the market.",
BluEyes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I DID love this machine. It was a ""one hit wonder""",the United States,17-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've only used it 2 times so far, but I can say that the suction is awesome and it really gets up the dirt. I love vacuuming and washing at the same time. So convenient. My hardwood floors look wonderful!  Previously I used a steam mop. I thought my floors were clean. They were NOT!!! The first time I used this, I couldn't believe the dirty, black water that it sucked up. YUK!!The only complaint I have is the battery life. I do have a large area to do (about 3000 square feet of hardwood & ceramic tile...the rest is carpet) So, a lot of hard floor surfaces. The mop only lasts through about 500 square feet. It would be the perfect mop/vacuum if it came with interchangable batteries, so one could be charging while using the other. As it is, I have to do my floors in 6 stages, with 3-4 hours charge time in between. I am tempted to buy an extra Tineco so that I can rotate them and use my time a little more efficiently!!UPDATE: I had such high hopes. But on my third use it stopped picking up the dirty water. Dirty puddles on the floor and the dirty tank was100% empty!! I cleaned it and could see straight through the vacuum line and tank that there are NO BLOCKAGES. It just quit suctioning. What a disappointment. What a waste of money. It is going back.",
Tairra,4.0 out of 5 stars,The mop and customer service is amazing,the United States,21-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,this review is not only for the cordless vacuum mop but also their customer service. I purchased the ifloor mop in March. A have kids and babysit so keeping little dirty footprints off the floor is a full time job. This mop was a lifesaver.  It was so quick and easy to spot clean or deep clean my whole downstairs. Suction was good and it really worked amazing.  Unfortunately in August it had issues which was just a fluke thing but it stopped working. I contacted customer support and I was expecting to be treated poorly but nothing could have been further from the truth. They spent time with me to go through the system and see if there was an easy fix. They ended up sending me a prepaid postage label to send the unit back and offered to replace the entire unit.  This is a very nice item. Im sorry it didn't last longer but things happen and thats why their amazing customer service was so important.  I would definitely recommend this vacuum mop and im very thankful for the great employees that took care of my issue.,
A123456,2.0 out of 5 stars,It works but there is likely a better option,the United States,25-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this item on July 15, 2019 - it was a Prime Day impulse buy.  I did minimal research but overall was excited by the features and the reviews.After several months of regular use, I've decided to share my thoughts on the product.Pros:Easy to useManeuverableLight weightA full charge provides enough power to clean my floorCons:The wheels - The brush head is set between two wheels, when you go over a part with the mop head, you cannot avoid the wheels running along side the brush.  This leaves streaks EVERYWHERE.The water/cleaning solution tank and reservoir - way too small; I have to fill and empty this multiple times during regular useThe mop brush - There is not enough pressure applied by the machine to actually scrub, it simply wipes.  In addition, it gets hair wrapped around it and you have to manually pull the hair off.  Finally, it's thick - which is good - but takes a very long time to dry.  Meaning, most of the time when you use it, it has a musty smellMop suction - even though the suction is fine, whenever you set the vacuum down, it leaves a puddle of water  behind.  I've tried turning it on once in place to clean up the puddle but that doesn't workSize of the head - though it's easy to move, the structure of the head makes it impossible to clean all places - think the space under the kitchen cabinets; the head cannot get all the way up to the edge of anything.Rust - there are many metal screws and other components that are visible.  These pieces have started to rust.  After only 8 months, some are deteriorating to the point that the machine will soon be unusable.Limitations - you can only use this on hard surfaces, at this price point, I'd like to see an item that can also be used on carpet for spot treatments.Vacuum - the suction is fine, it gets most things off of the tile.  The problem is that when you attempt to only use this as a vacuum, the filter gets covered in dust/hair/debris and needs to be cleaned several times during use.",One
Boydster,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased with purchase,the United States,3-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have a couple of cats that aren't the best at housekeeping.  The ifloor does a great job of cleaning the hardwood flpprs and bathroom linoleum and not leaving much moisture behind.  From the looks of the waste water, it's doing a better job than I expected.  Cleaning the waste tank is not a huge chore, and the fact that you need to clean it is the whole point.  Floors clean, tank water dirty.  I've not even come close to pressing the battery life to the limits, even using high power all the time, and it's an attractive design.  Glad I have it.",2
Amy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Is mine broken? Hardly any water!,the United States,21-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I am so disappointed in this thing so far! I have floors that need mopping very often, so I was extra excited to get this to help keep them clean! The thing hardly puts out any water though!!!! I checked everything, pre-wet the mop, and even kept pulling the trigger over and over while cleaning... which kinda helped, but really? I have posted some pics of the sad amount of water this was putting out on my floor.... how will this clean again?I would be better off with a swiffer mop.  I sent off an email with photos to support to see if this is a defect or just the way it is. Maybe I am doing something wrong since everyone seems to be pleased?Hopefully I hear back asap, I want this to work but im sending it back if this is as good as it cleans. Will update my review if I get a solution to this. I guess for tiny areas you can pump the trigger a ton it will work? But not for cleaning your floors properly",2
Carmen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for quick vacuum and mop jobs!,the United States,19-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is really nice for quick vacuum and mop tasks, but if you have a lot of debris to clean up in multiple rooms, you will need to dump it a few times. We try to vacuum more frequently so that we don't have to dump it three or four times for our house. We have two cats and two kids so we end up with a lot of hair, crumbs, etc. on our floors. It is really easy to grab this and use it for spot cleaning. The mop feature is nice, but definitely need to remember to let it self-clean the brush roller, dump the dust and water bin and rinse it out even if you only clean a small area of the floor or it will smell awful the next time you use it for either vacuuming or mopping. It holds a charge for quite a long time for a cordless vacuum/mop. It has pretty good suction for a cordless model as well. I really wish I could use it in tight areas and I wish it would vacuum or mop a little closer to the edge of walls or furniture than it does. Overall I recommend it, but probably not as your only vacuum option in a house. You will need something with a hose to get into tight spaces and along the edge of the wall and furniture. I'm glad we purchased it.",
hr2kr2,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt waste your money,the United States,29-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Update**I‚Äôve had this since September now. I keep it cleaned out. It‚Äôs easy enough to take apart and get any pet hair out of the machine. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs doing a good job cleaning anymore. I‚Äôm basically just pushing it across the floor. It still vacuums but does not get the floor clean. I have to go back over it with my mop. Why spend all this money and have to mop it the old fashioned way anyhow? I‚Äôd skip this model if I could go back it time. They only give a 30 money back warranty. Past that they will only replace parts that mess up. I‚Äôve had to replace the little rolling wheels on the bottom already. Even then it‚Äôs a lot of back and forth emails to finally get them to approve what parts you‚Äôre needing replaced.It works really good. Even with German shepherd hair. Just clean it frequently if you have a pets that shed a lot of hair. It took me a few days to figure out how to use the self cleaning feature correctly. I love how easy it is to vacuum and mop my floors now!,
Jackie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Skeptical buyer turned impressed!,the United States,18-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical, I went into it with the expectation that I wouldn‚Äôt like the outcome as I feel with every new floor cleaning product I buy for our hardwood heart pine floors. I wanted the crosswave by bissel but couldn‚Äôt justify spending the money if I was unsure If I was going to be happy so I purchased this after reading most of the reviews. I have only used it for about 10 minutes and these are my initial thoughts.1. It is so easy to set up, and comes with a small bit of battery power to test out. It won‚Äôt get you far but it will give you a small idea of how this thing works.2. It‚Äôs lightweight and compact, which has both its pros and cons. It doesn‚Äôt hold much water so if you are like me and your whole home is hard wood you will need to empty and refill several times. But it‚Äôs easy to maneuver and does a pretty good job of getting in tight areas!3. It does a wonderful job- honestly. My low standards weren‚Äôt hard to beat but it does honestly a great job of a deep clean and actually doing a good job of suctioning the water as well as debris on your floors.4. I tried it on a low pile area rug and it did wonderful as wellI‚Äôll update after I get a full charge on it and am able to do all of our area!",

I even find myself using it just for fun.I fought in between the different models and got this one just because it was cheaper.

K Lamel,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this little thing!,the United States,19-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have piano finished laminate flooring. And two dogs, a cat, husband and kids. When we had time, I swore my my powerful Hoover Floormate (which I still use on the kitchen, but it‚Äôs just too much for the laminate. Plus it‚Äôs not a great vacuum. Upstairs, I usually vacuum the laminate and then go over it with a terry mop. I took a chance on this because sometimes I just do t Jane the time for all of that. I am very much pleasantly surprised by how great this works! It‚Äôs amazing that it can vacuum and clean the floors at one time. And well!  I also love that it‚Äôs cordless. Usually I‚Äôm cussing out my vacuum cord as I get tangled and stuck on things. This is really a wonderful tool. Highly recommend! Also the charge holds long enough to do entire upstairs and more!",
Mary,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,21-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this because of the reviews and everyone raving about it. Not for me... too much work to clean it and it left water puddles all over my floor. After using, when I stand it up right and turn it off it just leaks out a bunch of dirty water. One time using it it didn‚Äôt even suck up the dirty water. Be prepared to take the entire thing apart after each use to clean. The bottom pad gets stinky if you don‚Äôt. This is worse than a regular mop. Returned this. Will stick to my swiffer. Easier clean up.",2
Allen,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,the United States,21-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE 1/20/21:Over the holidays, the iFloor suddenly shut down, and would not turn back on. Broken and dead after 15 months and maybe as many uses.I contacted Tineco by phone, and they asked me to send a video of trying to turn it on, as well as a picture of the charger used to recharge it (making sure I was using the original). I complied, and they sent me a new unit, and asked me to return the defective unit. I had to battle for 10 days to get them to send me the new unit first since I do not have such a large box laying around to send the old unit back. Tineco paid for return shipping. Three weeks turnaround in all.I hope the new unit lasts better. This is the second warranty claim in less than two years, and I only use it once per month. When this thing works properly, it is a pleasure and it renders great results. However, it's unreliable. Sadly.------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 10/08/2019The valve in my clean water tank fell apart, and there is no fixing it. Tineco replaced the tank under warranty. This has happened to others.-----------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWI bought this to clean and polish hardwood floors better than the traditional dry-mop that you just run over the wood with Bona or something.I let it charge overnight before using it since so many have complained about battery life. I cleaned all our rooms for 30 minutes and it never had an issue with losing power. Not sure what the fuss is about there. People should keep their expectations in line with what they are buying I guess.I was attracted to this because of the roller-wetvac combo that Bissel is so famous for. I was turned off by all of the quality and service complaints in the Bissel reviews, that I tried this instead. I've only used it once, so I cannot make judgement on durability yet. Build quality seems fine, however. The design seems well-though out, and it is very easy to operate.Now for the good part. The results.I used this with Pallmann Hardwood Floor Cleaner 128 oz Concentrate I bought on Amazon. The vacuum worked well enough to pick up typical crumbs, coffee grounds, and dust-bunnies. I did not try to stress test it to see if it would keep up with the Dyson. It was not purposed to be a workhorse vacuum. It vacuumed up the cleaner fluid as expected, leaving the floor to dry quickly. The polishing action of the roller worked just as I had hoped with the Pallman cleaner. The floors are spotless, streakless, and glowing after just one use.I found this to be very easy to use. The omni-directional head swivels to get into the tight spots, and the head is small enough to work well in such spaces. It is light, and very easy to push around. The directions explain to spray as you are pulling the unit back, but I found the stream was not strong enough to really douse the floor evenly unless I just keep the thing streaming mostly all of the time. It does not spray out like the swifter mop, so no over-spray finds the areas you just completed. Nice.Some reviewers complained about the cleaning of the unit itself. Even a mop and bucket has to be cleaned after use. This is no different. Yes, I had to empty the spent fluid once in the middle of cleaning, but what do you expect for a tiny 6.5 pound motorized wetvac? If it had a bigger tank, people would complain it is too bulky. I found the compromise to be just fine. Yes, the spent fluid was dirty and gross, which means the thing is doing its job as it should. Perfect. The cleaning process was not difficult, and simply required rinsing tank components in the sink after I finished. The unit has its own roller self-cleaning routine, so it takes care of the hardest part itself.If the thing continues to work without issues, this will be the last you hear from me. I'm loving it so far.",
Smithstorian,2.0 out of 5 stars,Slops water around mostly...,the United States,6-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really REALLY wanted to like this combination vacuum/mop but it really didn't come through. It was inconsistent on water coming out and being sucked up and you couldn't do a small room without having to dump the water and clean the filter. I can get it done 1000 times faster using my mopsie mop and bucket. The last time I used it I actually put water directly on the floor to use it to mop it up but it just took too much time to empty and clean and reuse over and over and over and over. And the brushes don't really seem to do all that much. Sad to report I disposed of this rather than look at it in my pantry.,One
sherri,4.0 out of 5 stars,It has made my life easier- could use improvement however.,the United States,29-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum/mop makes my every day clean-up more efficient- without using up all my time and energy. It does not leave streaks on my hard wood floors, it is easy to assemble and light weight. It picks up messes very well and gets the hard stains up. The clean-up and up-keep is a chore but beats the traditional vacuuming and mopping method. Because it does not separate the solid waste from the dirty mop water it is very gross to clean out. I do not like to pour into the sink or flush it. I have to separate the solid waste into a trash can and then dump the water into the toilet. The battery life is close to the 30 minute description the company gives- sometimes I feel like its a bit shorter than that. It does not get close to the baseboards and the parameters of where I am cleaning.",
Y.N-G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Vacuum/Mop,the United States,2-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is one of the best investments in a small vacuum I've made. This was the only one in stock at the time I wanted to purchase it, it's the basic model and I love it! I can imagine the newer ones are even better.Pros: - Vacuums and mops at the same time.- You can add the cleaner/deodorizer they provide to really clean the floor.- suction is great- light weight and small profile so fits under a lot of furniture.Cons: - Battery doesn't last enough to do my whole kitchen in one go.-Brush needs to be improved, maybe add some scrubbing feature.-You need to constantly keep your finger on the trigger in order for the water to release.All in all, I would definitely buy it again!",
Jess,4.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs alright !,the United States,28-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"If you have a big house , get something with a bigger tank!!! Both tanks run out & fill up quick . The takes apart and cleaning isn‚Äôt too bad but I have a child and 4 dogs , so I feel I must clean out every part of the machine when I take it apart . Again the cleaning isn‚Äôt too bad but refilling and cleaning the machine between each room can be a bit annoying but if you hate sweeping & mopping this machine still beats it! I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing something wrong but I feel it leaves my hard word floors kind of streaky but does great on my tile floor in the kitchen . The battery charge is decent but not long . I love cleaning the whole time in spot clean because I feel like it gives an overall better clean .I do love this vacuum mop, Buttttt if you have the money get a bigger & slightly better one!!!",
Vanessa K,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels cheap, terrible to clean, and we get maggots??",the United States,14-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was SO excited for this and utterly disappointed when it arrived. It felt very cheap, like someone smacked a mop attachment to one of those $20 mini vacs.Still I gave a try. Well, I gave it 3 tries.The spray button would only work if I pressed down very hard. And the spray was inconsistent. One area only a little would eject, while in another it was far too saturated.Cleaning the entire mop is no easy task with having to almost completely disassemble the device and all of its compartments. I would always sweep up before running he vacuum, but there would naturally still be some loose hairs or dirt I couldn‚Äôt get with a broom. These debris mixed with the moisture would clump and tangle around the brush area. I have scrubbed and soaked bht I still never felt like it got properly clean.So much so to the last run and clean, I ran through the living room and kitchen then went to clean and dry the items. While it was drying I noticed a small spot I missed on the bottom of the vacuum. I went to and scrub it away when I noticed movement. Maggots. Two maggots inching into the crevices of the bottom of the device. Who knows how many more may have been living inside of the machine itself while it sat in my kitchen. I would‚Äôve taken a photo had I not been rushing to get it out of my house.I was disgusted. I am still disgusted. My husband has been assigned the task of packaging this away for return this weekend.No more mop/vacs in my future. ü§¢",
Carolh,5.0 out of 5 stars,One-Step Tineco Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum and Mop,the United States,14-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is my first time to use the brand Tineco. Saw all the wonderful reviews so I decided to try the cordless wet dry vacuum/mop. I am so happy with this purchase so far. My kitchen floors look cleaner than they ever have just after the first use. Love it because it is cordless and I can now clean my floors all in one-step. I needed to find a mop that could wet the floor without using my arthritic hand to pump it. So far, this hasn't bother the use of my hand at all. Also...it is super easy to clean the machine after using and to charge it up between usage. I also bought this model because there are no dirty floor pads to wash or throw away. Just dump out the dirty water and you are good to go. My house really smells nice and clean now thanks to Tineco!",
Abi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor suction, inconsistent scrubbing, already broken",the United States,22-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love the idea of this wet/dry vac, but the scrubbing function was super inconsistent from the get go.  I have used this vacuum maybe 5 times, and now it has stopped releasing water all together.  Even when it was ‚Äúworking‚Äù though, it didn‚Äôt do a very good job, and left streaks that were completely dry and didn‚Äôt get scrubbed at all.  On top of that, the suction is less than impressive, and I found it cumbersome to maneuver.  Now that it doesn‚Äôt scrub at all (again- maybe the 2nd or 3rd attempt at using it at all), I called the company for help, and they basically said ‚Äúyep- it‚Äôs broken, return it to Amazon‚Äù‚Ä¶ but my return window has already closed.

colojess,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like it, don't love it",the United States,28-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for our basement, which is laminate, tile and carpet.  It is a pain to bring the vacuum down for one room and then sweep and mop the rest.  This seemed perfect. Ultimately, it is just OK.  I actually like it best for the carpet room.  It  is light, picks up fine and you can spot clean if you have a stain!  On the tile it does fine, but sometimes I think it gets too wet.  Same with the laminate, it tends to streak (I have a dark drown laminate) and then I end up using my Bona sweeper anyways.  It is light, charges easily and keeps that charge.  It also comes apart easily to clean the rollers.  Tons to like, but it only does an ok job on the non-carpet flooring. Darn.",2
Kati,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm the grossest human on the planet.,the United States,4-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This wet/dry mop vac will make you feel as though you've never cleaned your home before. Sooo for starters, if you haven't cleaned (swept, vacuumed or washed) the floors in a while... Run your old vacuum first to pick up the debris. This will help when it comes to actually cleaning the floors. Make sure you charge this baby too... I wish the battery would last longer but this is the high end price of what I was willing to pay for a wet/dry mop vac. It is super easy to take apart and clean (I had to several times during my intial run with this). I use the bissel hard floor sanitize but I really think anything you add will work... Just make sure it's a good ratio of water to cleaning solution and not straight solution. Buy extra brush rollers, they get very dirty very quickly. 1 year limited warranty is nice... I'll come back in a few months and give an update if I still feel the same.",
P Callihan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for daily or regular use,the United States,30-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I am changing my rating as I had to have my first IFloor replaced under warranty after the roller bearing and roller motor housing rusted and froze up after only a few months. Ive had the 2nd unit for only months and it is also on its way out.  Parts exposed to water should be made of something that doesnt corrode due to water! I follow all manufacture care instructions but that does nothing when the product is used daily!  I wont be replacing this one, warranty or not, 3rd time is a waste of time!  The product could be improved and hopefully they listen to consumers. 1. Use stainless screws and fittings to avoid corrosion. 2. Offer different roller brush options. grout & tile, textured laminated flooring and wood hold dirt and grime differant.  3. The squeegee rubber edge needs to be a healthy size so it can effectively guide dirty & water back into the return tank so that the floor drys quicker without dirty water remaining on floor. (The squeegee is to thin and high, doesnt contact floor so it is more 'decorative' than functional! ) No one would ever clean their windows with a squeegee they hold an inch away from the glass.Also: ""self cleaning"" is just a misleading marketing phrase when consumers still have to  manually clean and dry all parts after each use! Other companies try to use that phrase so check before you buy if thats important to you.",One
destanie,5.0 out of 5 stars,House full?? On the fence?,the United States,25-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Ok, I read all the reviews watched all the videos and knew I had to have one, my friend got the bissell cross wave cordless.. LOVED hers but after watching comparisons it wasn‚Äôt for me so I went with the TINECO. And boy how the heck did I live without it? We have 4 dogs, a bird and 5 kids not to mention my husband works hands on outdoors.. so mud, dirt, hair, feathers and seed, food, juices etc. end up on our floor we have a1700 sq home all laminate minus the rooms. It took us hours to sweep and mop and it still feel dirty, I even went out and got a steam cleaner. Which only added to the clean time. My floors get cleaned literally in 20 minutes. The tanks are small but I‚Äôd much rather stop and refill than sweep and mop. I‚Äôd deff buy and extra roller (just easier) and I‚Äôm. It crazy about the tineco cleaning solution. But the self clean keeps all the hoses free and clean. The take apart is so easy even my 70yr grandma can do it (she wanted to test it out)  so easy to clean, easy to use. Tip I always go with my floor not against so I don‚Äôt get streaks...  and I adore the dang thing it picks up everything! Only complaint is it dosnt get close to baseboards but how could it? A vacuums don‚Äôt either so if your on edge just DO IT!!!",One

I thought this would be perfect. I didnt want to spend more for the Bissell because I only really have dirt to pick up and this machine just couldnt handle it. I had to OFTEN turn the machine off and reset to start picking up more. It was very frustrating. And unlike the Bissell, you cant use this on rugs. It immediately clogged and wouldnt let me pickup anything. It is NOT worth $200. I would maybe pay $40 for this. I was completely disappointed. And cleaning this thing is touch! It gets so dirty so quickly!!The cleaner smells amazing!!!!!!!! And while I am returning the machine, I am keeping the cleaning solution.",

First use was great. I‚Äôve always cleaned it per instructions every use. I‚Äôve used it 3 more times and now it doesn‚Äôt seem to spray correctly. I have to turn it off then turn it on for anything to come out. Rather than nice cleaning solution coming out, I‚Äôm getting puddles of dirty water and have a hard time getting the machine to suck it up. Very frustrating. I‚Äôve triple cleaned the machine, checked for clogs, still getting ‚Äúbackwash‚Äù. Even after cleaning it out, doing a ‚Äúself-clean‚Äù cycle results in the holding tray filling with dirty water.

Liv,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't hold a charge. BROKE IN LESS THAN 4 MONTHS,the United States,23-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We loved this machine until one month in.Takes FOREVER to charge. Even when fully charged you can't even get through a full vacuum. We have a tiny 3 bedroom flat!. Literally RIGHT when the return window closed it stopped working and parts fell off.The rubber gasket(?) yellow thing no longer stayed in place and we found a little clear plastic thing floating in the cleaning solution tank. The vacuum stopped dropping water or sucking it back up too.I included an image of the performance in the form of a bleach wipe right after doing the floors. It is black! This machine does NOT clean the floors.  The roll that is supposed to be turning, cleaning the floors, NEVER got dirty.... now, I get it. It was vacuuming, not cleaning/ wiping the floors.",

It comes up missing half/most of the area of just went over, and I‚Äôve only used it twice! I vacuum before using it, and it‚Äôs so unimpressive, my floors remain dirty and streaky from the roller brush it uses. The hassle to clean out all the parts and let them dry every time you use it, isn‚Äôt worth it to me, and I‚Äôm 30 lol. I would say save your money for something with a brand name and the extraMoney to spend on it would be worth it. This just sits until I decide to use it and then regret my decision because it does such a terrible job. Go for the pricier brand that will get the job done. This is garbage.",

After about 20 minutes the thing just started pushing dirty water around the floor and stopped spraying clean water out even though clean water tank was still full.

Homey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used it once, love it!!",the United States,26-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Got this little machine yesterday, charged it up overnight, and then used it to vacuum and mop my kitchen floor today. Very lightweight and easy to use ‚Äî and very quiet. I had mopped this floor four days ago using a total of three heavy duty swiffer wet pads. And look how much dirt came off of it! It looks beautifully clean. I also used it on my hardwood living room floor. It seemed to have a little trouble picking up the water from there. I may only use it for my hard wood occasionally since it does put down quite a bit of water. It swivels so it‚Äôs easy to maneuver. Then I cleaned the tanks and parts as directed. Some wet pet hair was a little gross but not too bad. I think this is a great alternative to sweeping your floors and then mopping them. It‚Äôs faster and I think it gets them cleaner. Would definitely recommend it!",
lisa,3.0 out of 5 stars,Do not throw away your vacuum or your mop,the United States,29-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It does vaccum and wash in the same time...sort of... To start with, the product is not maneuverable enough to get to tight spots, or underneath your bed or cabinets. Places that are easily reachable with my regular vacuum, are untouchable by this one. it would not vacuum dirt from the edges of your cabinets or the baseboards very well. suction power is not great overall, but not extremely poor either...maybe a 3 or 4 out of 5. Washing is not what it should/could be either. it basically lays some water on the floor from the clean tank, and then it vacuums it (into a separate tank) while the brush does some scrubbing. This would work decently if it were not for the fact that the machine is very sensitive. At the slightest move that it does not like, it will give out the dirty water and make a puddle of it. At this point one would then have to release the water button and just vacuum so that the mess gets cleaned up. Then clean again. Going back and forth because of this is time consuming and energy consuming since this is not the easiest machine to maneuver. Do not go anywhere near a carpet or bathroom rug...the brush will get stuck and nothing gets sucked. You will have to restart the vacuum at this point if  you want the brush to work again.PROs- it vacuums and washes in the same time, theoretically saving time- cleaning the machine is not a breeze, it is actually a bit annoying since it has to be taken apart completely, but I count it as a positive since it does vacuum dirty water so all things considered, I think it is as easy as it can get- rechargeable (my place is 1,300 sqft and is 95% hard floor and tile and I can finish in one charge)Cons- suction power is not great- drips the dirty water onto the floor quite often- will  not work on any form of rugs (while it does work on my yoga mat and the kitchen mats, it is hard to imagine someone wanting to take out a second vacuum just to clean any bedside carpet or bath rugs)- rather on the heavy side, especially after using it for a little while, hard to maneuver- can definitely not reach all the places- if you have anything that is stuck to the floor, you might as well bend and scrape it off with your finger to start with. Chances are it is not going to remove it, and if it does, it will only do so after insisting on it significantly- holding down the button that controls the water flow can be consuming (maybe an on/off button for the water would be more practical)-  I did not time it, but it feels like I am not saving any time in the end since I have to go back and forth way too much (especially if you consider you have to detail clean this machine as well at the end). It probably takes the same amount of time to vacuum and wash with my regular tools and it would definitely be cleaner. I am for sure more tired when I am done with this, then when I clean with my normal tools.Would I return it? Not sure yet...I only used it twice and I really like the idea of doing both in the same time but it looks like technology is not quite there yet. I will maybe keep it for a quick light clean in between real cleaning. I actually bought four in my enthusiasm...my mom and my sister (they each got one) will probably find it helpful since they clean their kitchen floors every day (my mom has a dog, and she also cares for my nephew quite often) so they would be able to do a light sweep on a daily basis (if they don't find that having to detail clean it is not worth the effort). None of us will throw away our actual vacuums, though...",One
Adrian,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Small daily clean up,yes. Sanitation, not recommended.",the United States,19-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"In my opinion this would work a lot better if it was a steam mop version or maybe just used hot water. After mopping, everyone would end up walking around with black feet and that doesn't happen often our house even with the two dogs running in and out,I don't like the solution it brings so I created my own as I usually do. I think I'll use this for kids messes and still use my steam mop for sanitation that way we don't have dirty feet.  Also, the cleaning process is a hassel and if you don't take it apart and clean each peice and let them air dry before assembling it back together it builds up such a horrible smell, constantly emptying out the dirty water container is a hassle, we don't have a very large home and I end up emptying it out about 2 to 3 time and filling the clean water take twice...After each use I scrub the BRUSH rinse and let air dry.Not something I'd recommend. Yeah, I'm a bit picky when it comes to clean floors but it's great to have a product/machine to help make it easier and this is not one of them",
Darlene,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt waste your money on high hopes - they will be dashed!,the United States,2-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This product is just plain AWFUL and I am so disappointed.  I‚Äôm quite confused by the other positive reviews. The brush hardly makes contact with the floor, thus not cleaning it. The amount of water it puts out is inconsistent but that doesn‚Äôt matter because it doesn‚Äôt suck the water back up nor does the roller wipe it up.  It leaves long streaks of water, puddles of water, and spots, not even remotely cleaning the floor.  I‚Äôm stuck using this for the next well until my company leaves because I have no other floor cleaner, and this might maybe possibly be better than nothing.  After company leaves, this goes right back! Do not waste your money on high hopes-they will be dashed!!",

However, I haven't exactly been able to use it since then. It will not suction the dirty water, it just smears it around. There is no dirty water in the tank to empty after use. I have unassembled and reassembled and thoroughly cleaned it, yet nothing is working. The phone number for the company is not going through and I have not received an email back from support. I am just hoping this is a user error and it will get worked out because there are some amazing reviews on here and the YouTube videos for this product made me really excited to own it.",

It does a great job of picking up small and larger debris, while cleaning the floor very well. It also gets into the grout. Definitely a game changer!That being said, as with anything there are a few cons.One major issue is the resistance when trying to put the water tanks in. DON'T FORCE THEM IN! Make sure you have them lined up just right. My clean water tank broke and I had to replace the whole machine.The tube going into the dirty water tank clogs and will cause dirty water to flood back out. I suggest cleaning after every use. I also take a dry paper towel and firmly roll it up and snake it through that tube to get out anything that is hard to reach.The brush will cause streaks when dirty. Clean it well after every use, and use the self cleaning.The pros outweigh the cons. It is definitely worth the money!!",

I like this better on hardwood because it doesn't get in between my tiles in my grout to scrub and If my tiles are really dirty (I have 3 kids and 3 dogs) it leaves streaks from the brush not being 100% clean. The only other thing is the suction could be stronger to get closer to the corners under the cupboards. I do use this everyday though! I love this machine, saves a lot of time and now my floors are always clean!. I have used it for spills because with 3 kids something always happens. I would rate it 4 stars if it came with different brushes or I could purchase different brushes. I love that it's rechargeable so I don't have to replug it in every room.",

Once I‚Äôm finished I spend more time cleaning the vacuum/mop than I am cleaning the house. It gets clogged in multiple spots, I need to pull out the gunk with my fingers and it‚Äôs quite gross.

Ali,2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves wheel tracks on hard wood/ missing charger,the United States,11-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Firstly, this product came without the charger so I was severely disappointed by that, especially because I had only gotten the chance to mop half of my kitchen which is only about 100 ft.¬≤Second, I noticed that the mop also left behind wheel marks. This does not happen at all with my tineco vacuum. With my vacuum, I also don‚Äôt hear the wheels on the hard surfaces much. With the mop the wheels are extremely loud, so it makes sense why it would leave marks behind on my floor.Maybe I was just using it too fast because it was about to die and I had no charger, but whatever the case, I am going to order a good old-fashioned Ocedar spin mop and an OCedar electric spot cleaner to see if I like it better or if it‚Äôs worth the extra manpower, since I spent quite a bit of time trying to spot clean certain places with this electric mop.",
Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Floor Scrubber!!,the United States,25-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is worth every penny! It does a great job at scrubbing the floors. We have a toddler and a new baby on the way. So our time is limited and we appreciate any device to help us gain more time with our kid(s) and keep our home clean and safe.A few tips...1. Directions say to use a full cap of the solution, use only 1/2 that amount. The floors will still look great and you won't get any streaks or leftover soapy residue.2. Empty the dirty water bin often. Try not to be too disgusted or horrified on how dirty the water is, rather think of how much dirt this little marvel is scrubbing off your floors!3. I find the spot mode is the most effective, but only gives about 30 minutes max of cleaning power, so use your time wisely! A full charge takes at least 2 hours.4. Be slow in your pushes and pulls across the floor with the vacuum. It will be more effective at cleaning the floors this way. Don't treat it like a regular vacuum and go fast, the vacuum needs time to wet the floor effectively, scrub it, and then dry it. Going too fast doesn't really do much other than just getting your dirty floors wet.5. My final suggestion, which goes along with point number 4, the best way I've found to use this vacuum is to first saturate the floor on spot mode with the trigger held down (releases solution when held down) in a say 4 foot by 4 foot area rather quickly (like the pace of regular vacuuming). Then without the trigger pressed, slowly go back and forth over the area overlapping your last path.With these suggestions, the floors get really clean. Allowing the solution a few extra seconds to activate on the dirty floor, is key, followed by the vacuum simultaneously scrubbing the floor and sucking up the dirty water.Yes, in other reviews, it does state the fact that it doesn't get about 1 inch from either side of the vacuum head and from the front, not getting all the way to the baseboards. This is true, but what we have found this vacuum to be isn't a one trick pony, rather a great maintenance device to keep our floors squeaky clean. So, once a month you may still have to get down and scrub those baseboards and the edges of your tile/floors by hand, but hey if 98% of my floors are nice and clean a few times per week, that sure beats washing the entire floor on my hands and knees each week.This vacuum is been a gem to us and would recommend it to anyone! We're seriously considering getting a second one at how inexpensive it is, allowing us to get our entire first floor done in one charge with two vacs (~1,500 sq. ft. of tile).",
sal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Time saver? You have to clean all the parts after each use,the United States,17-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Easy to put together and must charge for 4 hours before first use. I tried it on my hardwood floors. It looked streaky to me but it did easily suction small particles. I think it‚Äôs good for maintenance but I‚Äôm not sure about big messy spills. To me if my kids spilled something like spaghetti on the floor I would first wipe up with paper towels before busting out this thing for a final clean. Also, if you are looking to save time by combining vac and mop you should know that you have to clean out the water tank, dirty tank and roller brush after every use. This takes time!!! I‚Äôll try out this machine a couple of more times before deciding whether to keep or return.",
Kathy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good in any aspect.,the United States,6-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This product is not good. I'm really disappointed because I was hoping for an amazing experience. If you have pets long or shot hair this product will just push hair around. If you try area rugs it will pill into piles. I tried it 2x. The first time I tried without vacuuming to really test its power. The water ran out on a small 5ft square space, and it pushed the dirt around. It also didnt pick up nearly as much water as it should so the floor stayed wet for a long time. It's quicker to sweep, vacuumx and then use a mop. The second time I vacuumed first. The same issue arouse where any small speck of dirt was pushed forward into a pile as you kept using the vacuum. Not worth the price. A steam vacuum works better and picks up more. Returned.",
steven everett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Time saver and does a great job,the United States,18-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love the time this vacuum saves me! I have three dogs, one of which is a long haired German Shepard, that belongs to my daughter. He sheds like crazy. This vacuum is a God send. Usually I have to swifter or vacuum first then mop and dry the floor and I don‚Äôt usually get around to the entire living room area. However, with this mop I was able to do the entire living, dining, kitchen, and laundry room in about 45 minutes. That includes emptying the dirty water container three times. That brings me to my only fault, if you want to call it that. The water tanks are small. But overall I would definitely recommend this product. The gunk and hair that came out of the vacuum made me almost puke!

Cleaning tool also has this knife-like tool that clears hair off the brush.Areas for Improvement- Good suction power but not something you would get from a good, wired, vacuum (especially for the price you pay, probably limited because it may drain the battery faster)- Capacity is fairly small for the washing liquid and waste container- No attachments.  All you get is the brush on the bottom.  Probably difficult to add attachment features because it also washes but there may be other workarounds.- My first one died in two weeks... I got a replacement easily through Amazon since it was a recent order.- When vacuuming/washing floor next to an edge, it does not get about 1/2 inch from the edge.  Roller brush doesn't go that far.- The vacuum bends down to only about 45 degrees from the floor.  It will not go under some of my tables or under the bed.  It would be nice if it can lay flat also.Overall- It's not a bad appliance.  Does its job.  I was just expecting more for the price.  Eliminates the mess and time of mopping.  I have two puppies so this is a daily chore.  I have a studio, all wood flooring. I never had to worry about battery charge dying while using.  Not sure how it would be in a large house.  The battery also cannot be swapped out.  If it does start die in the future, you will need to buy a brand new one.",
lgh,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT,the United States,17-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I hesitated buying this product and was actually planning on buying the Bssell Crosswave until I read reviews on how bulky/heavy it was. This cleaner is very light weight, easy to assemble (I didn't even need my husband to help) and I like the way it swivels around. I thought I was a pretty good house keeper, but when I emptied the dirty water container it proved me wrong. I LOVE having the clean water and the dirty water separate. I will probably be purchasing a couple for Christmas gifts for my kids. So far I have zero complaints. Oh did I mention it's around 40%+ cheaper then the Bissell.",One
Kimberly Landry,1.0 out of 5 stars,Problems  with running consistently and problems with charging,the United States,12-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I am handicapped so I love the idea of being able to vacuum and mop at the same time. I read the reviews and was so excited to get this product. However, I‚Äôve had problem after problem. Have use this successfully about three times. The  charger receptacle on the vacuum itself seems to be loose behind the plastic housing because I have to jiggle it to get it to charge. It constantly will either not start or stop after 10 minutes of use and both of these things happen after it has been successfully charged.  I also clean it out every time. Can someone please help me with this?  I would love this unit if it can work consistently so maybe it just needs a new part",3
Carolyn Stark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like the top sellers,the United States,18-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I had the bissel cross wave pet pro and it broke after 6 months just wouldn‚Äôt turn on anymore, so I purchased this one with not to much expectation. I like it a lot better than the cross wave. I like the fact that it‚Äôs cordless and the battery holds up long enough to mop 7 rooms in 4 story house so 20 minutes doesn‚Äôt sound much but it‚Äôs actually a long time. Also it doesn‚Äôt smell as. Ad as the bissel does if you forget to empty the tank once. It is very silent compared to all my vacuums and carpet cleaners and stain cleaning works way better than the cross wave did. I feel like the brush is a bit lower on the I floor so it rubs the dirt off the floor better. I‚Äôm actually pretty happy with this wet vacuum. Only con for me is a wish there was a second brush coming with it.",
Jack hunt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for my empty nest & routine, not deep cleaning",the United States,16-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is perfect for my household. Just me & the hubby, so I use once a week. I had kids, grown now, but if I would‚Äôve had this in my busy house with kids, here‚Äôs the problem: it‚Äôs super light weight & can be pushed with one hand with no strain on the low back & swivels like a dream,  pics up debris as long as it is small. Wouldn‚Äôt p/u more than sunflower seed size debris. It has to be taken apart, rinsed out & left to dry after every use or it will get nasty fast.  If you just wanted to vacuum, the roller is wet for about 48 hours IF you take it apart to dry. It also will not get up against base boards. It will be 1‚Äù away from any edge. Goes under anything over  about 3‚Äù high, but not more than about 8‚Äù because the handle does not lay down flat.With all that, it‚Äôs completely worth it to me!

Maria,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,30-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I waited until I was able to use this a few months to review. The first one I got didn't even turn on, after many emails back and forth with the company and they did send me a new one eventually.It worked well initially, but now it at times will almost leave my floors dirtier after than before I started. It leaves streaks and puddles of dirty water on the floor. It also doesn't clean up the floors very well. Honestly this cleans as well as I would expect a $25 machine to clean.It's honestly less frustrating to sweep first and then mop and I will probably just go back to my old products. Not worth the money in my opinion.",
DebV,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money.,the United States,31-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I run an in home daycare so I am constantly cleaning my hard floors. I‚Äôd loved the idea of a machine that could cut down the time it takes. Initially, I loved it!

It went in the trash after finding it'd dumped all the water/cleaning solution on my floor where I stored it.",2
CreatewithAlora,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as expected,the United States,1-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have vinyl flooring and three kids. I expected it to be a game changer for my household. It definitely wasn‚Äôt. I have to hold the water button the whole time, otherwise nothing comes out. It barely mists my floor. If you have stuck on food, it will not remove it even after going over it several times. It‚Äôs almost like the brush doesn‚Äôt touch the floor. It smells very quickly. Even after cleaning. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs trapping water some where but the next time you use it you can smell old water. Sometimes the dirty water drips out the back while your using it. The tanks are very small, so I usually have to refill/dump two to three times in one room. Overall it seems like more of hassle than just the standard vacuum and mop.",

I tested it in my son‚Äôs room and my white bathroom. I let both rooms get absolutely disgusting before testing.

Kelly Laughlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ever Home Must Have,the United States,8-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I seen this ALL over TikTok. We just got our floors redone and knew I needed something to help me clean them. I HATED sweeping then mopping. I never felt they were clean enough. I purchased this item and my floors have never looked so good!! The amount of hair it picks up is gross never realized it was so much. We‚Äôre a family of four with 3 cats and live in the county and open the windows as much as possible. This product has saved me hours of cleaning. Best thing I‚Äôd the floors aren‚Äôt sticky when your done. Takes about 20 minutes to do the whole house! Trust me if your on the fence about this YOU NEED IT! Clean it is really easy too!,
So Cal Tricia,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt last long‚Ä¶good thing they are inexpensive. (SEE UPDATE),the United States,27-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My first floor cleaner died after a couple of weeks. The company was great and replaced it quickly. That one has lasted a bit over a year, with moderate usage (about twice a month). Yesterday it died. It won‚Äôt turn on, and won‚Äôt charge up. Same thing the first one did. Now I have no idea how to get it fixed or replaced. Disappointing.UPDATE: I was able to get in contact with customer service. So although these machines die out much too quickly, I will say that Tineco‚Äôs customer service is fantastic. It has been a little less than two years since my first order. They have completely replaced the machine three times. Just got the most recent one. They said they knew there was an issue with the older batteries and chargers. So hopefully this one will last longer!",
Matthew,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It‚Äôs just meh, not worth the overall hype or price.",the United States,16-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So here‚Äôs the deal..... we got the Tineco iFloor wet/dry vacuum mop in hopes we didn‚Äôt have to sweep, vacuum and then wet jet our floors with 3 kids and a dog. It‚Äôs great in a lot of ways, but it‚Äôs not without its downfalls either.It‚Äôs great for the quick daily sweep/wet jet type clean, but if you want that deep ‚ÄúI put in some oomph to scrub these floors‚Äù kind of clean..... it ain‚Äôt gonna cut it.Maybe it‚Äôs a Mom thing when I watch my son very literally lick not only his food off the floor, but yes the actual floor itself, and then watch my youngest daughter in the walker running like crazy to keep up with her brother to then lay down and eat her toes that I am truly disgusted with what the Tineco does NOT pick up.So really - it‚Äôs great for the day to day, but if you want a truly good clean - bust out the old mop and bucket and put some elbow grease in because it‚Äôs not worth the hype, and definitely do not waste the absurd amount of money on the Bissell Crosswave, but be prepared to still have to scrub your floors even after using this if you want a good old fashioned clean floor.If I knew what I know now I would have just ordered the replacement parts for my actual vacuum sooner and a good old mop and bucket.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good,the United States,27-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really like the way this cleans. It's vaccine and mop. Does all with small daily cleaning.. can pick up pretty large particles of the floor and the spot cleaning is good for stuck on messes. It's perfect for kitchen floor,  I also clean our hardwood with it but all not sure if the Detergent is good for hard wood...The only issue is the Detergent it came with smells weird. It says don't use foaming cleaner so I've been using water and once mixed smash amount of alcohol with water to get a bit of sanitizing going on both for for and the machene,  but I'm so looking for hard wood cleaner that is non foaming (Bona leaves white steaks)",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Super nice,the United States,5-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have been using the Machine for 6 month. It is still runing strong but the reason I have replaced my review cuz they do not see any part for the machine. My water tank broke and I have tried to find it replacement but it is seems they don‚Äôt not see it. However I looked in their website and it is seems that they do not provide any part of the Machine. They just sell basic individual part and most of them runout. I believe they do not care about their customer and they just want to sell their products. I would not suggest any one to buy a machine that do not have any individual part for maintenance since every machine in the word need maintenace and replace every period of time.,2
Tiffany,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor suction for cat litter,the United States,19-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Honestly really disappointed in this Tineco. I used to have the A11 cordless model & that one I loved cause it is so lightweight. I regret buying this one instead of the A11 again since the suction power sucks for this one. I have 2 cats & this Tineco leaves some litter behind even when I vacuum over it.. when the water tank isn‚Äôt full or hot water it just leaves streak marks instead of the whole streak.. I guess if I‚Äôm putting down $200 I wanted a vacuum that‚Äôs strong since the A11 was only $20 more expensive. It‚Äôs definitely not as flexible as the A11 where when I‚Äôm turning in a different direction with this one it‚Äôs not easy to maneuver. I don‚Äôt know what the rage is about this product :/,One

I loved my bissell crosswave and I wanted to get a cheaper version for my camper... little did I know this cheaper version is actually WAY better than the overpriced $400 bissell!!! Of course I compared them to see which picked up the daily messes better, and this cheap off brand outdid the bissell ten times over!

Nb,2.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review,the United States,5-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought a tineco back in Dec after the tik tok craze. I have mainly all floors in my house so I thought it would be a great idea. I WAS WRONG. I have tile, ceramic, and wood in my house. Vacuum: It sucks... kinda. Sometimes it decides it wants to work. The tank is not full at all. I say there is a design flaw where the suction is because everything gets stuck there. Mopping, you push water out, and it doesn't go back in. If you want to think your floor is clean, this is for you. On the wood(Dark Brown): Looked clean felt clean. On the ceramic (wood grain):IT DOES NOT CLEAN IT. On the tile (White): It shows you how all it does is smear the dirty water. So my honest opinion, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.",

I couldn't believe how dirty the water was ( and I have young kids and mop daily)... BUT no matter how little of liquid I used, I had streaks everywhere (it may not even be streaks but it looks like the vacuum drags and scratches the floors cause there are 5-7 noticeable lines) and not to mention it takes much longer then regular mopping. I also feel like it doesn't distribute the cleaning solution all the time. Cause some spots are just dry with the streak from the device. I dont know if I think its worth the money to keep.",

I end up with debris all over my floors and have to do double work.  Honestly, a wet Swiffer would do a better job for less $$.  IF I could, I would pack this up and return to seller.

This machine is loud, the wheels are noisy on my floors and not to mention it leaves all types of stuff behind. The self clean mode is just okay, it doesn't completely clean itself either.

Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great daily user! Worth it!,the United States,8-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This thing works great. I use it every other day for tidying and cleaning up spills made by little ones. Easy to set up and use. I love that it self cleans. I still like to do a deep clean with a regular mop every 1 to 2 weeks just to use some heavy cleaning solutions. The first couple times I noticed it was streaky but after using it a few times you figure out the right direction speed and spray amount to avoid the streaks. My initial thought was that it was so light weight that it felt cheap. I quickly learned that just because it‚Äôs light doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs cheap. It does a great job for every day cleaning and would definitely recommend this to anyone.,

Stacey,4.0 out of 5 stars,What took me so long?!,the United States,26-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"With a house full of people and 2 pets the floors are always a mess at the end of the day. I HATE to sweep and don‚Äôt have time to traditional mop daily. I don‚Äôt care for Swiffer as you still have to sweep. I first saw the Bissel Crosswave and after I got over the sticker shock I found this gem. I am so glad I bought this. I have used it daily and some times more than once a day bc I love it so much. No need to sweep first! My poor dog is old and a little incontinent and this has been great for pee pee puddles. Just fill the tank with hot water and a little of my favorite disinfectant and go to work. The battery life is sufficient to clean 1800 sqft of tile. I haven‚Äôt tested it on any carpets area spots, but I really don‚Äôt think the suction would be enough to deep clean- surface stain maybe.This unit is light enough as to not kill my back and is very easy to clean after use. A full charge takes a few hours- typically I use it at the end of the day and plug it in when I‚Äôm done. It‚Äôll be charged before I go to bed so I don‚Äôt have to leave it plugged in overnight.I would absolutely recommend this product! It‚Äôs a time saver and easy to use.

The self cleaning is a great bonus and it really does get the majority out of the mop roller making the rest of the clean up easier. Battery has lasted me, I clean my entire place with plenty to spare. I was surprised by how much water it actually uses. I was thinking it would use way more then it does.

Luki,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wanted to love it but...,the United States,4-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was pretty excited when I received this. We installed vinyl plank flooring and I did not want to sweep every day. I figured a vacmop would be perfect for everyday clean and use the mop portion of it only on spots that my dogs left behind after a rainy day. The first week I used only the vacuum portion and it did great, but keep in mind it doesn't pick up any debris about an inch or so in front of the vac and also on the sides. After using the wet portion of it, it all came crumbling down. When I held down the button to spray water onto the brush no water would come out. I turned it off and back on and all the water came pouring out. It left dirty water streaks and when I lifted the vacuum some dirty water and debris was left behind. Same goes for when I used the ""self clean"" after each use. The tray had water and dog hair/debris inside of it. The clean up after using the vacmop was a pain. It doesn't separate debris/hair from the water so you need to use a strainer. I wanted to love it, but with the streaks, the debris left behind and the clean up, it wasn't worth the price to me. After using the mop once and cleaning it up like the manual says, it would pick up debris, but then leave it in another area I would go over. It didn't have as strong suction. For the record, I also had someone troubleshoot these problems with me for over an hour and they decided I should return it as well. I didnt want to deal with it anymore so I decided not to exchange it and just returned it.",

I have a toddler who gets food everywhere and this things will clean up anything from dried raspberries to granola crumbs. The only thing is make sure you clean it after every use, I made that mistake once and the dried up moldy stinky mess left inside is enough to make you gag.

I have a small apartment with only the bathroom and kitchen with tile, so I can only attest to small areas. I would imagine larger homes would take more time, as the tank isn't the largest. Still, faster than traditional vacuuming then mopping, and no bending. So, I'd say, even with larger homes, this would make your life easier, even if you had to refill fresh water/dump old water every so often.Overall, I'll do anything to save time and just make any job easier, this did just that. Highly recommend.",
D. Serna,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,the United States,26-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This vacuum works really well. The suction is good although I don‚Äôt think it scrubs hard enough. I have some stubborn sticky messes created by my toddler and I ended up have to go back and spot clean those sticky marks with a sponge and Clorox spray. It‚Äôs pretty easy to clean the vacuum and you can tell it does clean because the water is filthy when you empty it. I use this vacuum most days but twice a week I still steam clean my floors because I don‚Äôt think this vacuum gets everything super clean. It works better on wood or laminate floors. I have laminate and tile and the vacuum doesn‚Äôt reach the grout lines of the floor. This could be annoying if there‚Äôs a stain on the grout line.,
gsp443,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's OK for light cleaning,the United States,26-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This floor cleaner is alright for light cleaning. Maneuvers well and is lightweight. I'm using it mostly on pretty dirty, painted concrete floors (not the garage) and it doesn't do a great job on them. I should have waited to afford a more powerful cleaner. If I spray water with some solution on sections of the floor a few minutes before using this machine, that helps but really slows down the process. Also, it doesn't get the edges of the floor at all, so you still have to crawl on the floor to get all around the edges. It seems to suck up the liquid pretty well, so that's nice. The floors dry in just a few minutes. If you have hard to clean floors, I recommend spending the extra money for a more powerful cleaner.",
Nicole,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what it's cracked up to be.,the United States,23-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have used this in multiple rooms, I honestly do not see the difference in much besides the floor is wet after. Which leaves a weird film and streaks on the floor, making the floor worse than before using. I actually went back and used my shark steam mop after to clean up after. It also doesn't hold a change long in comparison to time needed to charge.",One
Meg,1.0 out of 5 stars,disappointed,the United States,3-Nov-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have had this vacuum for about 6 months and I'm frustrated and ready to buy something else. Maybe I got a faulty device, but this vacuum does has not worked as well for me as I had hoped based on the reviews. Every 5 minutes, I hear the suction get blocked and I have to stop to empty the bin because the mesh has been blocked. If that hasn't happened, I start noticing that nothing is getting picked up and I have to use a pipe cleaner to unblock the tiny passage between the bottom and the bin. It is way too easy to accidentally hit the spray button while vacuuming, which clogs it up even worse. I thoroughly clean it every time I use it and I still have problems every time I use it. Maybe its not a great vacuum for a house with pets? But it should be able to handle a little bit of cat hair, there really isn't that much! Wishing I had just spent a bit more money on a trusted brand.",
Jenn,2.0 out of 5 stars,This is a pass,the United States,29-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to be in love with this based on my needs.  I used it a couple times to clean up after my kitty who sometimes gets sick on the floor.  Once I pick up the mess, I would then use this to clean the floor.  After only a couple uses, the machine smells horribly.  I took it all apart and washed everything including the roller on the bottom and air dried it.  Nothing helped.  I turn the machine on and it smells awful.It also sometimes randomly leaked water on the floor.You can do much better.  I wish I could still return it.",One
Tara M,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am in love!,the United States,2-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This ranks as one of the best purchases I‚Äôve ever made for keeping my home fresh and clean. I have 5 boys in my house (4 kids and a grown kid aka husband). Also, I HATE mopping! Now for the details:Great suction, it picks up so much hair and debris. So happy I don‚Äôt have to sweep before mopping now.Can‚Äôt believe the filth that it cleaned off of my floors!I live in a 3400sf house with a LOT of tile, this is a lifesaver!I always felt like I was pushing dirty water around when mopping and felt like I needed to empty and refill 100 times when I mopped, and still didn‚Äôt feel my floors were clean, which is now confirmed.The only negatives:The battery doesn‚Äôt last very long, especially if you use spot clean more than a minute.It is disgusting when you clean the dirty water tank and other parts of the machine. I do this each time I refill the clean water tank. It‚Äôs super easy to clean, but it is gross! I‚Äôd rather clean this machine than a mop and bucket any day!Get it, it is a dream!!Will update if anything changes, I‚Äôve only had the machine for a couple of weeks now. I‚Äôve given it a pretty good workout already and I‚Äôm still amazed at how great it is every time I use it!",
Felisha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great replacement for mopping,the United States,28-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love this floor mop! I have 4 year old twins and two dogs so I‚Äôm constantly cleaning my floors.I have a Tineco Stick Vaccum (the A10 model) I‚Äôve had it for almost 2 years. I use the A10 to vacuum dog hair then use the iFloor to mop my floors.It is much easier than mopping and takes half the time.My only issue is that the iFloor does not suck up dog hair very well. Whenever I first used it the suction had issues because dog hair was stuck in the vacuum. It was very easy to clean out and worked great after pulled out the dog hair, I just learned I have to vacuum before using the iFloor.The iFloor is a great replacement for mopping!Also, VacuumWars on YouTube did an excellent comparison video of the iFloor vs the Crosswave.If your in the fence- get it, just know it doesn‚Äôt suck up dog hair.Just to add- I have aussies who have long hair and shed like crazy so other dog hair may be different.",

Long story short, my 18 month old associates eating with play time throwing everything he does not eat on the floor just to watch my reaction. The kitchen gets messy with my kids running in and out of the house, sand from the playground, etc. this has been a game changer! I can instantly clean the house in half the time. Prior to getting this, I‚Äôd have to clean up any water or wet food (rice, cupcakes, spills), then sweep, use the dust pan and finally mop which I‚Äôd have to wait to mop because as a mom I don‚Äôt have too much time for all these steps before my kiddos are in need of my attention. So so so pleased with this!",
Britney T.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just not quite good enough,the United States,28-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for cleaning my hardwood floors. I spent months trying to decide if I should shell out the big bucks for the Bissell crosswave, and honestly? I wish I had. I think this machine could be great, however the brush barely touches the floor... and isn't that what it's supposed to do? I have dogs and my hair is very long, so I do use a hardwood vacuum first (I trust nothing to not get hair wrapped around it in this house) so I was looking for this vacuum to wash my floors. And it's fails. So if a brush comes out that is thickee and more durable, I will change my review, but for now, I cannot recommend.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Never again,the United States,1-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I've had this vacuum a week.I was initially disappointed that it doesn't mop the whole time you vacuum but that was more my fault I'm sure it says it somewhere in the description. But then a couple times I noticed it stopped vacuuming. So I'd empty it & shut it off turn it back on & it seemed to work (mind you i empty it after every use & am only using it for a small kitchen/living room & bathroom) the part I really hate is that dirty & dirty water goes into the same container which is gross to clean.Then today went to vacuum & it doesn't pick anything up. It leaks also now I had to put a paper towel down where I keep it. The only thing I like about this vacuum is that it's quite. It looks cheaply made also. I honestly just wanna return it & get my money back. I was very disappointed in this & had high hopes.,One
yusake,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,7-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôve had this since November of 2020 and at first I thought it was the best thing ever, it was easy to clean and would get my 1bed 1bath apt clean in under an hr. I swept before using the machine though due to the fact I have a dog and didn‚Äôt want to clog it or anything like that. This past month though, I‚Äôve used to once and it completely died on me. I have charged it, deep cleaned it, and let it rest for a week and still have not been able to use it. I kept up with the cleaning and regular maintenance of the machine and it still died on me. I‚Äôm not sure if I got a lemon or if it simply doesn‚Äôt last. I‚Äôm just super disappointed because I also emailed the company about maybe getting a different battery but I never heard back. Overall if you do purchase it, definitely keep in mind it might burn out on you.",One
Bee,1.0 out of 5 stars,Rather spend more for a better brand.,the United States,8-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Super bummed. Got this as part of my Christmas present. We just moved into a house with all hard floors. Mostly laminate. With a toddler and one on the way I was really getting tired of sweeping and mopping what felt like every day.Took it out and assembled it (which was pretty simple). Read the directions and got it all charged up. Filled up the reservoir with water and the floor solution and got to work. It was much louder than the video makes it out to be. As I was pushing it I noticed it‚Äôs suction wasn‚Äôt great. It was missing small pieces on my laminate kitchen floor. It‚Äôs seemed to clean it pretty well. Moving to the dining room I started the same process and realized it just seems to be pushing things around. After the floors dried they were super streaky. Overall i wasn‚Äôt pleased. I tried cleaning the floors one more time before I returned it.,2
Donna Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for the money and works well!,the United States,19-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have only used it once so far but I like it.  It did as it was supposed to do.  There is a bit to do afterwards with clean up of the machine but it is all necessary because it picked up so much!  I couldn‚Äôt believe how dirty the water was and how much dog hair it picked up.  I didn‚Äôt want to spend $300 on one and I‚Äôm happy I was able to buy one for a lower price that seems to work as well as the more expensive models.  So I‚Äôm a new user but so far, I‚Äôm happy.",One
T. L. Agner,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG!  SO QUICK! SO EASY! SO EFFECTIVE!,the United States,30-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I cleaned and vacuumed the main areas of my house in 40 minutes!  I cannot believe the amount of pet hair and bird seed this lightweight yet powerful little guy gathered up.  I emptied the DWT two times because I could not believe my eyes!  No more wondering if I am just sloshing dirty mop water all around my house.Usually vacuuming hurts my back, but nope...not this time!  Granted,  foe extra clean you will need to sweep edges of baseboards and wipe down but for a lovely, quick clean on a regular basis, this little machine will be a huge blessing!!",
CPayne,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Purchase,the United States,28-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really like this device.  The only problem I have is that it does leak a little bit.  But not a big deal.  It cleans my floors and they are dry much faster than a mop.  This allows me to do sweep and mop once and not have to do both.  I couldn't be more happier.  It's very pricey which almost turned me off, but I'm glad I bought it.  Being able to wash everything is so much easier too.  I'm sure I'll have to replace the spin mop eventually but for now it gets rid of the dog and cat hair that plague my home and it's not such a chore to do daily.",One
Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice vacuum and mop,the United States,8-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,The first one I actually had to return because it wouldn't stay charged. However when I got this second one and it worked very well it lasts long enough for me to do at least a thousand square feet if not more. Suction power is very good and it does not leave streak marks on the floor at all. I use it on rugs and on the hardwood floor. Everything works fine easy to clean easy to install. When I did have to return it it was easy they came and picked it up from my house and I exchanged it with the other one. Now I definitely cannot live without this mop.,
T84,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great cordless mop,the United States,1-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I waited until I used this multiple times before leaving a review. I appreciate the dual tanks, no cross contamination of dirty water. Battery stays charged long enough to clean a very large area of my house -multiple rooms. LOVE that it is cordless. The self cleaning feature is great- but do not skip taking the machine apart and cleaning the removable pieces after each use- you do not want a stinky and dirty machine the next time you clean. This may seem tedious at 1st, but after a couple times this process is quick and easy. Rated a 4 star out of 5 because I may have enjoyed a slightly wider mop head and water tank. This product gets my floors clean and I am happy with this purchase.",One
Nicole Tribble,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not really pet friendly,the United States,8-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We got this for my mom because her vacuum is too loud and big. My mom has a Bernese mountain dog, so a long hairs dog that sheds, and this has a hard time actually sucking up the hair without clogging. You would need to do a quick sweep before actually trying to vacuum because it has a hard time picking up even little bits of paper or feathers. It did an okay job at the actual washing the floor part.I HIGHLY recommend getting if you have no pets or pets with minimal shedding and using for light foot traffic areas.I do like the small size and the basic design, along with the quiet noise and self cleaning mode.",One
Weltonlj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,20-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This thing makes my job so much easier!!  I just bought a new home in which the previous owners left the place filthy.  After scrubbing everything by hand I was able to do all the final floor cleaning with this and it was wonderful!  I actually just bought a second one for the second floor of the house because I use it so much more than the battery can take.  I highly recommend it.  The picture is the difference in the floor- the darker flooring outside the room is almost a completely different color all because I cleaned the floor with the ifloor!,
Ahaupt,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favorite.,the United States,1-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So I bought this after hearing great reviews about it and now that I have it, I'm not so sure I LOVE it like I was hoping. It says it's for pet hair, well why does the pet hair keep clogging it? This was while using it before the mopping part, just vacuuming. I had to stop literally every 2-3 minutes just to unclog the dog hair and it wasn't even that much hair. It's frustrating. I am very tempted to send it back for my money back as this is just too much of a hassle to deal with. It does mop okay, not amazingly but it does the job. Guess I should have stuck with the Bissell.",
Kayla Edwards,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money. Doesn‚Äôt work well.,the United States,30-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"After seeing videos all over TikTok about how ‚Äúgreat‚Äù this vacuum/mop is, I really wanted to purchase this. After waiting a few months due to the price of this thing, I finally took the plunge and ordered one. And I definitely don‚Äôt understand what all the hype is about. If I could return this product, I would. With a price tag of $170 or more depending on which one you get, it‚Äôs NOT worth that much. It‚Äôs so cheaply made. The minute I pulled it out of the box I knew it Was going to be crap. I personally would not pay even $100 for this cheap piece of plastic, if I had to do it over again. The suction on the vacuum is OKAY at best. The mop part, is awful. It leaks and leaves drops of water and random puddles of water on the floor. When you use it as a mop and then switch to the vacuum it takes several times of going over the same area to get all of the resting water off of the floor. It is also a pain that you have to take so many sections apart, clean, and let air dry after you‚Äôre finished using it, especially since it only seems to work halfway decent for small areas like spills/messes. It‚Äôs definitely not made to clean your entire house, or even one full room. I have never Bought an expensive vacuum. I have always had a cheap vacuum from Walmart. So for me to spend this kind of money, on a product that I‚Äôd give maybe 2 stars for as a review, I am so disappointed. Save your money. Not worth it. I wish I could return it, and save my money, and eventually get the Bissell bc this vacuum is a piece of junk!",
Kevin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would Purchase Again.,the United States,31-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love this little guy!!  I use this almost daily. I have a small dog and this keeps up with his little messes very well. Noticed that it makes a mark on the baseboard so I added a few padded pcs to the sides and that was stopped. I don‚Äôt find the emptying of the water reservoir all that hard or annoying like other reviewers. Would purchase again.,3
Jenny L. Cash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this thing!,the United States,26-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is great! I have 3 heelers (Australian cattle dogs) the hair is everywhere! I hate sweeping because the hair just blows all over. This was the perfect solution! After about a month I have only had it get clogged twice and that was the first time I used it. It handles dog hair, dirt, and grass clippings like a pro. I also love the mopping function because your useing fresh water instead of sticking a mop in a bucket of dirty water. I wish I had gotten the upgraded version but to be honest I was very sceptical. Grat product!",
ljp,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible product,the United States,4-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I bought this product about 3 month ago.  It stop working about two weeks ago called and my husband talk to customer service with the problem involved with the machne.  A new battery was sent out that took about a week.  That did not solve the problem.  He talked to customer service again and some time next week they will send a box out to send the product back and and then another one will be sent out.  A refund can not be funded thru the Tineco be we bought it thru Amazon.  Good lesson.  Will not purchase any kind of machine thru Amazon again.,One
Colleen Woodworth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for Quick Pick Ups,the United States,1-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought the Bissell Crosswave, which is great, but found myself rarely using it as it seems more suited to a ""formal cleaning"" due to the time involved.  Decided to order this and I am beyond excited and amazed.  I have 2 messy kids (age 8 and 2), who leave food everywhere after each meal, plus 3 hairy cats.  This is just what I needed for a quick clean.  I live that it's cordless and it actually picked up spots on my textured stone floor better than the crosswave, such as in crevasses.  Love, love, love this thing.  Not sure how long the battery lasts, as I only use this for quick clean ups, but now will be pulling out the crosswave even less!!",
Mod_Max,2.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is a toy.,the United States,4-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Didn't clean worth a spit. The little rotating brush is a joke. Barely adequate as a vacuum, much less a mop. Not enough weight for it to stay flat to the floor, and it misses too many spots. Going back to my trusty microfiber push mop that has 2x the coverage and actually cleans my hardwood! The reviewers giving this silly thing 5 stars must be living in an Alternate Universe, where Unicorns and Fairies rain down candy kisses and make everything work like a dream.

Jessica,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt waste your money. It‚Äôs garbage.,the United States,1-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is probably one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I am throwing it out. I bought the product thinking I could vacuum and mop at the same time. It worked pretty well the first couple of times. Having to manually clean the vacuum each time was annoying, time consuming and defeated the purpose of trying to save time vacuuming and mopping. After a couple of uses it stopped working. The vacuum stopped sucking things up and the mop wouldn‚Äôt release any water. I tried everything to get it to work and it didn‚Äôt. I am throwing it out. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",
Emma-Leigh Canfield,5.0 out of 5 stars,So Amazing!!! Dog Hair Wonders,the United States,20-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I did my research before purchasing, was looking for something for our new vinyl plank floors and I am BEYOND happy with this purchase!!! I could not believe the amount of dirt, dog hair and grime this thing picks up! I just love that it does both vacuuming and mopping and you can do both at once! So if you don‚Äôt need to mop and just run over your floors for dirt or dust this does it too. I can‚Äôt believe how light it is, how well the spot cleaning scrubs dried footprint and paw print marks, and how spotless my floors are after! Since it is small and lightweight the clean water tank isn‚Äôt very big so doesn‚Äôt hold a lot of water. Same with dirty tank you‚Äôll have to empty it out a few times depending how big the area you‚Äôre cleaning. I personally don‚Äôt mind and like that I can get extra hot water for each section of my house. You only need 1 capful of solution for clean water tank, the auto clean cycle for the brush is awesome, it‚Äôs just all around a good product. I read the Bissell cross wave was heavier and louder so this appealed to me more. If you have a dog that sheds this is the machine for you. We have a Rottie and since it‚Äôs summertime he sheds like crazy and I‚Äôm constantly sweeping up hair and dirt because he‚Äôs an inside/outside dog. I‚Äôve never personally owned a Rumba but I have family that does and this sucks up hair equivalent to it. So if you‚Äôre debating on getting it go ahead and do yourself a huge favor and buy it. You‚Äôll never go back to vacuuming and mopping separately!",
Nicole G.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice little machine,the United States,12-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I waited a while to review this product.  I am happy with my purchase.  I use it on tile and hard wood.  I wanted an alternative to a steam mop that leaves my wood floors dull.  This cleans them well, but be aware this is not a super aggressive cleaner.  I still have to hand scrape some stuck-on food spots that the brush won‚Äôt lift.  Sometimes the mop leaks dirty water and the reservoir is not full, not sure why this happens but it‚Äôs not a regular issue.  The other negative: it takes a while to clean the vacuum and have to let it dry when done.  Overall it‚Äôs a great machine for routine cleanings.  I purchased instead of Bissell as it was a fraction of the cost.  Now I hope the battery lasts...",
Jenna Dawn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product besides received one that had already been used.,the United States,16-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have one of these, and absolutely LOVE it. Use it every single day. Just recently ordered my mom one off of amazon, and it looked like it had been used, the roller was dirty, the wheels had stuff on them, and it was missing the part where you put water and the solution in it. Overall this works great, and i will be ordering her another one. It of course doesn‚Äôt get down deep into the floors so i still have to do a deep mop every few days, but you wouldn‚Äôt believe the amount of dirt it gets up!!!",2

Was a little concerned the battery wouldn't hold a charge long enough but no problem cleaning my luxury vinyl entry, bathroom & open combination living dining kitchen area. Love it & looking forward to use again. Another tidbit about the battery...l charged it several days prior to using & was still on full charge the whole time l was cleaning approximately an hour or more. However it was not continually on all that time...l would turn it off periodically if someone called or other interruption. Thanks Tenico for inventing exactly what l have been seeking!!",3
jon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its OK but has issues,the United States,18-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Nice little vac for the money, but if you have kids, a large floor to clean & plan to use it on a daily basis, I would shop around for a bit. The battery life is about 22 to 25 minutes if you don't use the deep clean function. It takes up to 4 hours to return to full charge. The charging cable actually stopped working on mine & its about 4 maybe 5 months old. When it did work I loved it. Had great suction & cleans the floor pretty well. The dirty water Reservoir is pretty small but its pretty quick & simple to clean. Hair gets so tangled in it though. It wraps the roller of course, but it also gets stuck between the roller area & the dirty water tank. So you have to pull it out. You also have to put the vac over the sink or tub edge to flush the line out bacward between the dirty tank & the roller area or else it gets really gunked up & smells. Its an OK machine, I just wish it would have been a bit more durable.",
djtrob,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It worked great at first, but not very durable.",the United States,11-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,When I first got it it was smooth and quiet running and can pick up almost anything wet or dry.

Does not do well picking up longer hair.I replaced the roller and it helped a little bit reached out to customer service they said they were going to replace it under warranty but I haven‚Äôt seen a new one arrive. They were very responsive over email but not the phone.You must constantly clean the machine or it will start to smell. There are multiple parts to take apart it is not easy but it is not extremely difficult. I would give it five stars if customers support was more responsive or if the machine was more durable.The battery lasts a long time the floors come out very clean.,One
N. Gallagher,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Sure This is Being Returned,the United States,28-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I put in a star for customer service as they responded to my Amazon question about a problem I was having with the roller bar almost immediately, giving me a cs email as well as phone number. Unfortunately when I called the number, they are only open Mon-Fri so I will have to wait until Monday for my other issues. The roller bar is now working, but I can‚Äôt seem to get the spray to spray when pulling the trigger. Sometimes a really, really, really fine mist will come out. Other times it pours out and I have to soak it up with a towel (and that is WITHOUT me pressing the spray trigger). Between fighting with the sprayer and grabbing towels, I‚Äôm going to the sink to empty and refill containers. I really wanted to love this machine. I was hoping for the holy grail - or at least an improvement over my $20 Libman mop. At the moment, Libman wins but I‚Äôll give their customer service a shot on Monday. Maybe it‚Äôs user error. If so, and the ifloor performs well, I will happily change my review.",One

It is fast and convenient to use the Tineco vacmop suck-up and clean.  I have also used it for a weekly mopping and have used a white paper towel to see if it did clean and dry the floor...the paperwork is only slightly moist and clean.

melissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine but ‚Äúself-cleaning‚Äù is misleading,the United States,17-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My floors look the same but feel different under my feet. I have 3 dogs so I sweep and mop a lot. The difference I feel on my bare feet is crazy. It doesn't just push the small particles around that are left behind by a mop and broom, it pucks it all up. I have to be honest though. The phrase self-cleaning is a little misleading. I thought I would push a button and it would rinse all the parts and dump into the dirty water reservoir. It does not. You still have to take some things off to clean when you are finished. The thing that is ‚Äúself cleaning‚Äù is the spinning brush.  All in all I‚Äôm happy with it.",
Dmn6355,5.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,the United States,11-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Well what seemed to be the best purchase ever quickly became a waste of money. The vacuum worked great the very first time we used it on our kitchen floor (very small area of hardwood in our home). By the second time it would no longer hold a charge and by the third quit sucking and started leaking water all over our wood floors. Contacted Amazon for a replacement and they kept talking about trouble shooting... I am well within my return period. They are out of stock so cannot even process a replacement so looks like we will be returning this and going to the crosswave by bissell instead. Not impressed.,
Lovenmykids15,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dont buy if you have hair,the United States,13-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Ok so honestly I'm very sad thisbis a great product however if you have any kind of hair longer then an inch it's not the vac for you I have kids and the hair is wrapped around theRoller its awful  its way too much and for that reason its low stars if you have no hair itll be great but with hair it's a nightmare you would need a new roller every week,3
Andrea Fratarcangeli,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life makes it not worth it,the United States,16-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited for this because it was supposed to save time and effort compared to mopping. The battery dies so quickly, I had to charge it twice just for my kitchen, 1 bathroom, and hallway. Considering it takes 2 hours to charge, and not even half my house is done, this will be a multi-day endeavor. And each time you charge it, you have to take out all the wet parts--it says self cleaning but that isn't the truth. There are 6 or 7 parts I had to clean, and then wipe the dirt from the actual vacuum, as well. I'm almost thinking old school mopping would be less of a burden. If this had an option to plug into an outlet, or came with a spare battery, I wouldn't mind it as much. Also, for tougher spots, the spot button uses up the battery even more quickly. Because of these reasons, the price point on this wet dry vac is highly over priced for the actual value of the product.I vacuumed my floors before using this because I was dumping the dirty water tank in my toilet, and I didn't want my toilet to get clogged with hair or dust, so I'm not sure how the suction is, and don't really care much about the vacuum aspect of it. Just thought I'd mention it, because it's another hassle to think about if you're using the vac and mop at the same time.It was nice that it came with the floor cleaner. It has a fresh clean scent to it, but I wish there were other options such as vanilla, or holiday scents like orange cinnamon. There are no options to choose from, and it says you can only use their brand.I haven't decided yet, but I am highly leaning toward returning this and just using a regular mop. I really wanted to love this, so I am quite sad.",
Janey B. Hathcock,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost sent back...,the United States,8-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was ready to send it back until I read a review that explained how to use it.  The manual is terrible.  She said to get your floor really clean then run this about 2 times a week to keep it clean.  Also to empty the dirty water when it reaches maximum.  I ran it yesterday and had a very dirty brush, etc and then reran today and couldn‚Äôt believe how dirty my water was again and my floors look great.  If I wait too long next time I will vacuum first with my Miele and then run this machine.  It‚Äôs very easy to do once the floors are pretty clean.  Just have to do it more often which is something I should do anyhow.",
Sumi Casey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does it work?,the United States,29-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bit of a pain in the rear to be honest. I am keeping it and using it, so I guess that is something, but it gets funky very easily (mildew smell).  I think if this was combined with a steam mop function, it would be outstanding - and maybe a way to make sure the roller dries out between uses to avoid the mildew smell.  If I have not used it in a few days, I have to take it apart and clean it before cleaning or my entire house smells sour.",One
Jason,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective immediately,the United States,26-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Waste of time- after initial charge I cleaned one kitchen and living room- water was barely coming out and wasn‚Äôt very dirty after. Set to clean self after taking apart to remove etc and it immediately overheated (according to manual) left alone until next day. Continued to start flashing as blue then switch to red and stay solid red. Manual says that means is defective‚Ä¶ if there has to be an area indicating defect I imagine this isn‚Äôt unusual. Disappointed and frustrated by the time spent waiting then having to package it together just to order something else. Skeptical to try the brand again.,
Sydney Parks,5.0 out of 5 stars,The answer is YES.,the United States,23-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"If you are wondering if you should buy this... the answer is YES. I was also skeptical (I‚Äôm talking to you, Mom in the back who is tired of their toddler's mess.) I thought, there is no way someone has figured out how to cut vacuuming AND mopping into one package. BUT THEY HAVE. If you have a dog - you‚Äôll get this. You know when you sweep/swifter/vacuum the floors and think you get all the hairs only to start mopping and cringe at the sight of pushing the hairs around. THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED. I have a three-year-old and a labradoodle (he sheds - hypoallergenic, my butt), and this vacuum has made me the happiest person on earth. We have Luxury Vinyl Planking through our house and I was soooo tired of it just never looking completely clean. Everything I used seem to leave a residue film on the floor and I hated it. The first clean clean I did with the Tineco I sat and watched it dry to a nearly unrecognizable finish on my floor. If you‚Äôve made it to the end of this review and still don‚Äôt think you should buy it then you are probably one of those people who don‚Äôt like anything and you don‚Äôt deserve the satisfaction of perfectly clean floors.",
Tatiana Dudziak,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is incredible,the United States,24-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this mop/vacuum. Parents of toddlers, this is a must buy! It‚Äôs decently quiet and it‚Äôs cordless! It‚Äôs amazing at cleaning up kitchen messes which happen basically after every meal at my house. And my kids love ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me clean with it. Before I had this I rarely mopped (gross I know but who has the time for it). This thing is such a time saver. I always feel like my floors are super clean after using it, the water in the tank is always filthy afterwards which makes me feel like it‚Äôs doing it‚Äôs job. I use reverse osmosis water in the tank and have never had issues with streaks. Absolutely worth it!",
DylDabSi,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So much potential, but didn't meet my standard",the United States,13-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,TikTok made me do it and I was not impressed. Such a great idea and a great price point. It honestly didn't get dirt up any better than my spin mop. The self cleaning really did nothing. It just made me paranoid that it was gonna get moldy and mildewy. You spend a lot of time cleaning this thing after every use,One
catherine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where has this been my whole life!!!,the United States,20-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Saves so much time!!!!I no longer have to sweep the entire house of hardwood floor and then turn around and mop it all! This has cut down my floor cleaning time by half! No more dust flying when I sweep because i don‚Äôt need to sweep, it sucks all the pet hair and dust right up along with the water it puts down. I didn‚Äôt care for the cleaning solution it came with, I‚Äôll stick with my fabuloso, and the suction could be a tad harder but other than the stray penny I find on the floor, it‚Äôs sucked everything else needed up! It‚Äôll tell you when it needs to be dumped and the cordless feature is just plain amazing!!!!",
Jmays712,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine for the price.,the United States,27-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We recently replaced our flooring and now have laminate throughout our downstairs.  With two dogs, we end up with a lot of hair and a variety of messes. I didn‚Äôt want my weekends spent sweeping and then mopping so I was looking for something that would do both and not cost 400+.I found this gem after seeing several reviews on line. I have used a handful of times for regular cleaning as well as cleaning up a spilt cup of coffee. Overall, no complaints. The unit sweeps up the dog hair and variety of other debris as well as cleaning the floors. The floors dry quickly and there isn‚Äôt a sticky residue life I have had a with a different mopping system. There is a small amount of water that remains on the floor when you shut it off - but it isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me.The unit is easy to clean out once you are done using it. The dirty water bin takes a bit of finesse to get it to snap in. Not sure if I am not lining it up correctly, or what. It takes me a couple of tries before it snaps into place.I am very happy with this purchase and have recommended it to others as well.",
Chelsie sanagustin,4.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs just simply worth it.,the United States,10-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Okay here‚Äôs a review for everyone to read! I have 8 dogs,yes I said EIGHT dogs.majority of them are fluffy so they shed year round like crazy and if I don‚Äôt clean every single day it looks like I never do! This works! I will say for the animal lovers if I skip a day of cleaning I sweep before I use the tineco just because it‚Äôs so much hair and I honestly don‚Äôt like emptying it out so much because of all the hair that‚Äôs accumulated. However if I don‚Äôt skip a day of cleaning I don‚Äôt sweep and she does the job and she does it well too! I‚Äôve used multiple cleaners in the tineco so far just so see what‚Äôs going to work and what‚Äôs not and honestly I like the tineco the best so I buy it specifically. However I‚Äôve used and still use different cleaners with a stronger scent every now and then and it does just fine. Just make sure whatever your using doesn‚Äôt produce a lot of bubbles because it will cause the tank to overflow and you‚Äôll have to stop and empty it and run the self cleaner with water a couple times to clear it out. I really have no complaints other than it doesn‚Äôt get the edges closest to the wall that well so I do have to do a deep clean still once a week. I think this is literally a perfect invention for someone who doesn‚Äôt have 8 dogs and will blow your mind at what it can do and how fast. I also have a toddler and cleaning up after him and his spills are effortless as well!",
Larry,1.0 out of 5 stars,The smell! Doesn't leave your floors feeling clean,the United States,29-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The vacuum works well but the SMELL. It is horrendous. We use clean water/solution with every use but there has to be water sitting in the unit because it's so strong and reeks of mildew.

We are no longer able to use it. *We have cleaned the rollers and tanks many times, no improvements.",2
Cheryl,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm impressed,the United States,24-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"When I first unpackaged this little guy I thought it would be terrible and not really suck up dirt stuff because it's small and lightweight and cordless. Boy I was wrong, this little sucker does an amazing job of sucking up the dirt and dog hair and all the other gunk. I LOVE the fact that I can mop at the same time I am vacuuming... it cuts my cleaning time down to a 1/4 of what I used to have to do - sweep, dust buster, swiffer, mop. This does it all!! Now it doesn't mop as well as say you would by hand but it's good enough for regular day to day cleaning. It's easy to clean too. LOVE IT!",
Paul M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for maintaining cleanliness!,the United States,17-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I'm so glad that I bought this! I have 2 dogs, a very sandy yard, and toddler. I've struggled to keep my floors clean with a walking/crawling baby and this product has been a game changer. It will not totally replace having to bust out the vacuum here and there to get into corners and narrow spots but it is amazing for maintaining clean floors throughout the week. My toddler hasn't had dirty feet or hands since I've bought this machine so for me it's a win. The main living areas of our home are modest so there's enough battery life to do the whole thing. Cleaning the parts after each use isn't terrible but does take an extra 5 minutes. Worth it to be able to have clean floors all of the time though.",
Hamby A Haney Jr,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tineco cannot be trusted!,the United States,28-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We love this product.  We had been using a wet jet swiffer.  But it didn‚Äôt really get our LVP floors clean.  Maybe because we have a bulldog.  Now, after his nightly playtime, we just pull out the Tineco and mop up all the slobber.  And, best of all, we can tell the floor is really coming clean without any sticky residue.Update:  The product lasted just under 1 year!  The battery died and it can‚Äôt be replaced!  We still loved the iFLOOR and ordered a new one.  Unfortunately that‚Äôs where the trouble began.  The day after we placed the order we decided we would rather have the iFLOOR 3 and requested the order be canceled.  Tineco said the order could not be canceled because it was already shipped.  That was okay, but the item had not been shipped and wasn‚Äôt shipped until six days later, after we disputed the charge with our credit card company.  We will refuse delivery when the package arrives, since we no longer trust Tineco and have no idea what quality of merchandise they sent.",One
Philly_Tre,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money.,the United States,11-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This floor cleaner is a waste of money. Four hours to charge and less than 20 minutes of operating time. I have a small rowhouse in Philadelphia with pergo laminate flooring and 20 minutes is not enough to clean the first floor. It has no effect whatsoever on tile surfaces. It leaves streaks everywhere. The closest it can get to the edges of your baseboards is about 2‚Äù away- I can tell by the contrasting streak marks. The motor is extremely weak. I‚Äôm finding it hard to think of anything good to say about this thing.,2

erica sheppard,4.0 out of 5 stars,Positives outway the negative,the United States,18-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like that it cleans and mops at the same time. It clean)pick up hair very well. My battery last way longer than the product says. My dislikes are ( even though it says self clean) the roller requires cleaning by hand at least every three days, to stay fresh. I would recommend getting a second roller. Also when cleaning or dumping the dirty water, if you are going to flush down the toilet, use a stainer. It is hard to separate the water from the hair and larger pieces. The time it takes to clean the dirty pan and then self clean and then again clean the dirty pan takes about 5-7 minutes. At night it is best to leave the roller and dirty water holder out; this way things will dry and not build up an odor. I will say that is is easy to push and is better on the back and arms than sweeping and mopping alone. Sida bar...it does not work the best on stairs. I do enjoy my product, bit will get a second roller for sure. Set up was super simple and easy.",
Jo B,3.0 out of 5 stars,So far not so great. I'm a bit disappointed,the United States,28-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Received last weekend, finally got to try it this weekend and I'm disappointed. You know that picture where it is sucking up milk and cereal - not at my house. Sort of sucked up milk, pushed the Fruity Pebbles around under the fridge and I finally gave up and went back to hands and knees cleaning. I had so hoped this would work with 4 grandkids living with us between 2 and 10 but my Swiffer Wet Jet did better on the sticky messes. It is quiet and lightweight but doesn't do what I need.",

I used to have to dry swiffer all my floors then swiffer mop all of my floors and THEN vacuum the mats/rugs but this thing does it ALL!Best purchase of my adult life besides the house I am mopping. I have a 1300 sqft house and I can MOP the entire house in less than 30 minutes. The dry time is less than 10 and while it may look streaky while you‚Äôre mopping it drys NON STREAKED.My only complaint if I had to have one would be that you MUST clean it THOROUGHLY between each use or you will be able to smell the dirtiness from your last use in the dirty tank while you mop.But c‚Äômon, why wouldn‚Äôt you clean it after you mopped?If you are looking at these reviews to determine if you should purchase this mop or not....DO IT!

Leona Shaw,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought it for my 81 yr old mother. Works great for her (:,the United States,19-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I would give this product a 5 star rating if it would clean all the way up to the edge of the baseboards. Leaves about an inch to an inch and a half of dirt along the wall edge baseboard so you have to clean that by hand or a different mop. I purchased this because it‚Äôs cordless & my 81-year-old mother has oxygen hoses to maneuver so no cords is perfect and needed something lightweight. Mom runs out of energy easily so this helps her from having to sweep all the floors first and then turn around and have to walk the same square footage for mopping.

J,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BUY. Smells horrible, works even worse.",the United States,10-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"After a few months of using this...I would say do not buy it for multiple reasons.1. The smell. I cannot express how badly it smells after one use on a dog mess in the house. Even if you empty the water immediately and clean off the brush, it lingers in the vacuum and sometimes the water collects in the suction tube.2. Never sucks up the liquid completely and leaves puddles of wetness from both the roller and the sprayer. I have to use a separate mop just to dry up the smelly water left behind.3.

Pen Name,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great product,the United States,17-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to replace a broken Hoover hard surface (corded) cleaner.  I love it for quick jobs and for cleaning up small messes throughout the day. My only bummer report is that it comes with one roller instead of two. While there is the ""container"" on the side to hold the brush after washing it, the brush doesn't have a chance to dry out unless one were to leave it in the container for a few days. I ended up purchasing a second brush so that I can have one washed, cleaned, and dry and the other in the appliance. But I feel like it should come with two.  It is a little time consuming to clean it after each use, but I'm a bit persnickety anyway and would clean it whether it needed it or not. Overall, I'm satisfied with this.",
Lisa Eaton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the investment,the United States,14-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing cuts down on my sweeping/mopping time as it does both jobs at once! It is well worth the investment.  I'm always amazed at how much it gets up. We don't wear shoes in our house but it seems to always clean up so much dog hair and mud from where the shoes get placed. The first time I did our house I did the first floor first then the 2nd so it took two charges, but now that I do the house almost daily I can do the whole house on one charge.  I'm always amazed at how much dog hair this thing gets.The only down side is I wish the stairs were easier to do and I wish I could get under things better, like if there was an attachement some how.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good buy,the United States,4-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The thing is only good for spills. It doesn't actually clean. It's good for light traffic areas, and not good if you have pets. It needs to be taken apart and cleaned everytime you use it, and the only reason I'd use it is if my kid spills juice or something on the floor just to suck it all up. And then I still need to clean the floor with cleaner. And then also clean the vacuum so I'd say skip this step and just clean it the first time by hand. Would give zero stars if I could.

R. ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good.,the United States,27-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I wish I had realized something like this existed a long time ago. It it so much easier to be able to vacuum and mop at the same time. Having an entire house that is laminate flooring I absolutely hate always feeling little bits of dirt under my feet and can only clean so many times a day. Vacuuming only never seemed to get everything up and mopping is so time consuming and messy. This has definitely saved me a lot of time and makes my house feel so much cleaner. I have about 1,200 sq ft and am able to thoroughly do the whole house on one charge and one tank of water. It has a spot cleaning feature that runs the rollers a little faster and does a pretty decent job getting tougher things up.I've noticed, though, that I pretty much have to constantly be pushing the spray button to keep the roller wet enough to thoroughly mop while using it. And the only notable downside is that if you stop moving it or lift it up to carry over a rug or something, it drips pretty bad. When I turn if off to go dump out the tank, where I left it has a puddle underneath which is annoying.  And I can never get it onto the docking station without a little mess. Regardless, I use this a couple times a week and it has been a good purchase.",

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Long lasting and excellent on smooth and level surfaces,the United States,25-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Good price works excellent on hard floors picks up most things as a vacuum and mops at same time dried on items take a little longer. Not very good on non smooth surfaces and needs more bristles for better scrubbing for dried on items. Should make a separate head for more scrubbing then it would be perfect. After use leaves minimal amount of water on floor and must clean after each use to avoid build up issues dues to hair and minor dirt not being left behind in suction area just like any other wet vac would do.

Jessica W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I freaking love it!,the United States,22-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is amazing. We have 3 dogs and 2 cats. I vacuumed with a normal vacuum and scrubbed with an ocedar spin mop 2 days ago. And my Tineco came today so of course I unboxed that baby and started on my floors right away. U guys, the nastiness this thing pulled up and the amount of hair and nasty dirty water made me feel disgusting.  I'm a clean person so to see the water like this made me sick. I do really really wish the battery lasted longer because I have a large main floor and it's all hardwood and stone. It took me 2 full battery charges to do it all.

EKRep,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,the United States,24-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I read tons of reviews, watched videos etc. prior to pulling the trigger to buy this. Let me start by saying I have three different floor types and have tried the machine on all. Laminate, sealed concrete, and wood textured laminate. The suction is okay for quick pickups, grass, dog hair small debris. It takes multiple passes, which is fine although I didn‚Äôt feel like it cleaned much better than a swifter minus having to change the pads out. We are a house of 5 with a Doberman. I typically run the robotic vacuum daily, sweep mid day and as needed & mop in the afternoon. Honestly I prefer to manually sweep and mop! I will say this is good for quick messes, but not for overall cleaning in my opinion. There is about an inch gap on the sides where it does not clean/reach.",

The gadget is also a lot less expensive that those brand named items but trust me, it doesn't feel that way.It was way easy to assemble and disassemble when done and cleanup was a really easy. I will definitely be using this more around the house.",
Esther S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt buy it,the United States,20-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Update: there is a burning smell and water is leaking out when we don‚Äôt use the mop feature. I‚Äôve even tried cleaning out the filter and replacing the water but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.Honestly this vacuum doesn‚Äôt work well. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again or recommend it because it doesn‚Äôt clean and mop well. Even after multiple runs our floors are still dirty :(,One
Summer K. Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life?!,the United States,18-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"First off, I want to say that I read review after review of all the mop/vacuum combos out there and decided on this one because of a good balance between good reviews and lower price.  I cannot say how this one compares to any other brand or model, but I can say that I love it.  I have also owned swiffers, steam mops, spin mops, standard mops, and the wet floor attachments on my Kirby.I knew going in, that this wasn't going to have the suction of my Kirby or the floor cleaning power of a hands and knees scrubbing, but for lighter cleaning, it is awesome. And it actually has better suction than I thought it would have.  I have two toddlers, two indoor cats, and very dark laminate floors.  These floors show every cat hair, cheerio crumb, sticky fingerprint, and spec of dust.  Before the Tineco, we were mostly just vacuuming.  Obviously we'd clean up wet spills when they happened, but we only mopped once a week.  And even after mopping, I never felt like the floor really got clean enough because you're reusing the same water. Well, we've had it for about a week and have not needed to use our vacuum or mop. I don't intend to get rid of them, but I think we will be using them a LOT less.As a dry vacuum, it is great for hard floors and thin area rugs.  It picks up all the dust, crumbs/cereal, and cat hair.  It does not have enough suction to thoroughly vacuum carpet, but I like it much better for our area rugs because the roller is much softer than a traditional vacuum roller and will probably extend the life of the rug. And because it's cordless, you can just grab it and go.  I love this feature. Obviously you can only use it as a dry vac if the roller is dry.  It only comes with one, so we will probably order a spare.In mop/vacuum mode, it truly vacuums and lightly mops at the same time.  I worried that the cat hair would just stick to the roller, but it gets sucked into the dirty water chamber just like everything else.  I say ""lightly"" mops because there is no way to apply extra pressure when scrubbing over stuck on grime.  However, if you hover over it long enough, you can get some stubborn spots clean. The description says it doesn't ""refresh"" area rugs the way some of the other brands do, however, my teen spilled cola on our rug and the TIneco got all of it.  It also worked great when the little boys decided to pour their waters on the floor and splash around in it until there were puddles all over the kitchen.  I just used the vacuum only feature and it sucked all of it up.ProsVery light weight and easy to useEasy to clean- it has the self cleaning brush and it's easy to take apart the dirty water receptacle to clean the filter.Cordless with a decent battery time.  I haven't timed it, but I used it on 1400 square feet, forgot to charge it and used it the next time to clean the same area.Price! It's less than half the amount of some other brands and I honestly don't think they could work so much better that it would warrant spending an extra $200.Your floors dry in the same amount of time as a regular mopIt cuts cleaning time literally in halfCons-It does not get older grime and stuck on food.It doesn't have a hose attachment for getting edges.  However, I don't think any vacuum/mop has this feature.The dirty water tank needs frequent emptying (maybe every 700 sq ft depending on amount of solution used).  I don't know how this compares to other models.",
Shawnna G.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,20-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Probably my favorite purchase ever!! I have been using a steam mop on my floors for a long time but it just took entirely too long and still didn't get my floors clean. Between two kids, and a husband who consistently forgets to take shoes off in the house, I do have to go over my downstairs floors twice but it gets my floors so clean I love it!! We have a chocolate lab who sheds profusely and even after sweeping like crazy this thing still picks up tons of hair! When you're finished the parts come apart very easily for cleanup.. The only thing I will say that I don't like is that the dirty water tank has a low ""fill"" line and you can't go over it otherwise the dirty water can start coming back out of the bottom. So other than that small annoyance I can't complain!",

Don‚Äôt buy the bissell, save the money and go buy Tineco!!! Only thing I wasn‚Äôt fond of‚Ä¶ it is still a vacuum so you can‚Äôt get the corners or close to the walls cleaned.

Onyx Parrot,2.0 out of 5 stars,Works great - but cleaning it is a real nuisance,the United States,28-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This cleaner works as advertised, and does clean up hard floors pretty well, although in some places you'll need to go over it several times to get a spot out. Combining the vacuum with the mop does save time - until you need to clean it up.Because this is essentially a vacuum cleaner with (dirty) water spraying through it, cleaning this up after each use is a real pain. It must be disassembled, each part cleaned, and put back together, a process that can take 10-15 minutes. If you don't do this, the iFloor ""cleaner"" is likely to become a stinky mess.  This makes using it for quick spot cleanups prohibitive. When you factor in the time required to take it apart and clean it, it's quicker just to reach for your vacuum and mop bucket.",One
Toolguy1964,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a deep cleaner,the United States,23-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"As others have said, don't expect this to be a heavy duty, deep cleaning machine at all.  It is quite light duty and doesn't clean very well. The brush roll is more like a paint roller with a few little rubber nubs on it that doesn't work well on tile floors.  Tineco should make a nylon bristle roller brush for tile as it would scrub the floor much better.  The supplied roller brush may be ok on sealed wood. Suction is very poor and the machine streaks dirty water.  The battery doesn't last but about 15 minutes and it takes about 6 hours to fully charge the unit.",One
Mama + Mini Designs Co,1.0 out of 5 stars,DISGUSTING WASTE OF MONEY,the United States,5-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this vacuum in December 2020, so I‚Äôve had the vacuum for 3 full months, going on 4 now. The suction is awful, for one. It constantly drags around dirty water and leaves streaks and drips of it everywhere. A swipe of a paper towel with a little water cleans the floor better than this $180 vacuum.On top of all of this, the vacuum itself never seems to be clean. No matter how much soaking, scrubbing, and air drying, it reeks of a vomit-like smell. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting.I was so excited about this product based on reviews here and videos of the product versus the Bissell Crosswave, but this was a giant waste of money. DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",One
Amber Maxon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult to communicate with issues,the United States,17-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This product is a good idea but too pricey for what it does and doesnt do.

Crosbi Jentsch,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,the United States,26-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I don‚Äôt really write reviews but I got this Tineco and about 2 weeks later it quit squirting water. I sent it back and when they received it they sent me another one. I was satisfied with the exchange and was thrilled to get it back. It worked one time and quit charging I contacted the company a few weeks later trying many different things to get it to charge. The light would come on and it appeared to be charging but was not. I contacted the company for a full return because you can‚Äôt go through Amazon and they Informed me after 30 days you can no longer get your money back! For a machine that cost this much you should have a warranty for longer than 30 days. The company knows this is not a good product. Very disappointing and I WILL NEVER buy a product from them! You are better off getting a mop‚Äô less money, less haste and unfortunate,works way better!",
Jessica,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Eh, it's great for quick cleanups not deep cleaning",the United States,28-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was super excited to finally purchase one. Maybe it's because it's the original but I'm not as much in love as I thought I would be. I have 2 kids under 2, 3 dogs, 2 cats and a husband. My house is 80% hardwood, it works wonders for quick clean ups and just a quick ""mop"" job. It doesn't do well for a deep cleaning or on rough spots (even on the high traffic setting) I still have to get a good arm scrub with a mop. I like it for convenience but I don't love it enough for what I paid.",
Tony,5.0 out of 5 stars,Problem Solved!,the United States,11-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Having a toddler means having little bits of food on ground after eating and this vacuum makes it very easy to clean up every mess.

TacticalMike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid wood or tile cleaning excellence,the United States,18-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Where is the sixth star? I never write reviews, but this device is perfect. The fact it vacuums and mops at the same time is superlative. I just had porcelain plank flooring installed in my home, had several areas of debris and water stains, this device handled it with a breeze. If the spot or stain is moderate, pull the trigger, if it is heavy, hit the spot function. It cleaned perfectly with no streaks using the solution and warm tap water. You should clean it after each use, but that is easy as well, takes two minutes. It ran about 20 minutes on the first charge no problem. It disassembles with ease for cleaning. Also, the cleaning head is narrow enough to reach in tight spaces, i.e. between the toilet and wall, between furniture and under tables. I am trying to find a negative aspect of this product and I am struggling. Buy this, I promise you will not be disappointed.",2

Sara ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,21-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I wanted this vacuum for so long and finally got it last month. Because I was so excited I watched a ton of videos and read a lot to learn more about the machine and how to use it. Maybe I got a bad one but from the first time I used my mop I was less than impressed. The spray button only kinda seems to work, I don‚Äôt notice a difference when using the spot feature, and it leaks awfully even if the tank hasn‚Äôt reached the max line. I wanted to love this machine so much but it is absolutely a waste of money. The few times I felt like it was actually working it left my floors looking streaky and dirty. The only positive thing I have to say about this vacuum is the battery life was pleasant but that doesn‚Äôt really matter if the vacuum doesn‚Äôt do what it is suppose to.",
Tina R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money.,the United States,10-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Worked for 3 months. I used it a handful of times and now it wont even come on.  This should last much much longer than that.  I thought this would be great since we were getting rid of our carpet to put down planking.  Might have been great if I could have used it longer. I was on the fence about what brand I was going to get ultimately... I chose very wrong.  Will never by this brand again. I rarely give a negative review but I have never had something stop working that had such good reviews.,
Hilary B,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells, doesn't clean in corners or against walls on floor at all",the United States,10-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So, I tried to love this I really did.  We have 4 kids under 8 so always dirty floors and use it so often that the mop rod at the bottom didn't have a chance to dry between uses.  This created a smell so powerful!  Also, it doesn't have any suction power against a wall, so you still need to pull out a broom in the end.  Not happy.  Kept past return point by 1 month, and wish I wouldn't have.  I have friends that swear by it, but it's just not for me.",

But again, small inconvenience. I can easily clean my whole first floor and then some like an OCD freak on the daily without it running out of charge, and that‚Äôs WITH it being on ‚Äúspot mode‚Äù a lot of the time.

It is not self cleaning. The roll gets filled with hair and you constantly have to wash it. It doesnt clean up all that well.  The tank for the dirty water gets filled up fast and you also have to constantly clean it. If you don't let the filter and roll dry it will start to smell like humidity. It just sucks.

It won‚Äôt replace your standard vacuum, but it‚Äôs ability to pick up debris/crumbs while washing the floor is a Huge bonus. The water goes a long way as well- I usually only have to refill once to do the entire downstairs (eat-in kitchen, laundry room, entry way, dining room, living room) and all 3 tile bathrooms. The Spot option is great for getting up dried food/drinks and the dirty water it pulls is enough to make You're stomach turn (was I Really living in my home with the floors That dirty!?) I clean weekly, and was mopping with a Bona- this works great on our tile and hardwoods.

After you've been running for a bit it spits out a bit of dirty water from the back, and the floors don't look that clean after using it. It does actually clean a dirty spot ok if you hold down the spot button. You must clean it out after each time you use the mop function or it will smell.

For the first time I could walk through my house barefoot and actually feel the grains on the nice clean floor. It picked up all the dog hair, just amazing.

A. E. Hartman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great machine, wish it was bigger and had swap out battery",the United States,14-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is a dandy machine. It does pick up and tolerate a reasonable amount of dog hair and other debris. I like it. My only wish is that they would just make it about twice the size with a larger swap out battery. It would be great for an apartment but in a larger house you have to keep refilling the clean and pouring out the dirty water. The battery does have a fair longevity. However, for a larger house It does most of the the job and then needs a recharge. Once you get the hang of it the cleaning goes faster and farther on a charge. The customer service is also very very good. This company is conscientious and trying hard. Five stars.",
Momoffour,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after three months,the United States,25-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I ordered this because my sister has another model of a Tineco floor mop that she loves and I thought this was it. It‚Äôs definitely not. This has never cleaned my floor well and now it is leaving puddles everywhere no matter how many times I clean it out. The O ring on the water holder has fallen off and stretched out so much that it won‚Äôt stay closed any more. I‚Äôm just over my 90 day warranty and so disappointed with this product.,

I have to do half and then empty/refill, and charge before doing the other half. Overall, I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase but I‚Äôm not in love with this thing. I had high expectations for it and it didn‚Äôt meet them.Pros:Lightweight, cordless, easy to cleanCons:The cleaning solution it comes with left a film on my floors, battery life is too short for me to do my entire house on 1 charge, doesn‚Äôt get the area of the floor close to the baseboards",
Carmen Faustino ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best thing you'll ever buy!!!,the United States,23-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is THE BEST thing I have ever bought! My 1 year old spilled goldfish all over my playroom floor. Its that textured padded flooring that sucks to clean because it has all the little divots. This vacuum picked it ALL UP. ( video) It got all of the crumbs!!! I use it to clean my hard wood floors and its amazing. I would use a swiffer wet jet and go thru 5 pads to do my entire 1st floor. And there would be streaks!!

This is good for light cleaning or spills. We have teens coming in and out with dirty and greasy feet and I have to clean the vacuum roller and tank more than the floor.

My dogs will occasionally have accidents so I‚Äôm constantly cleaning the floors. I have used this machine every day and I wish I would have bought it years ago! It picks up all the fur and dirt with no problem! Simply clean out the filters! It takes about 3 hours to fully charge. I can use it on a large size kitchen and living room and hallway before it needs recharged. I would recommend using a low suds cleaner because if you don‚Äôt it will leave a soap spot on the floor.

Nicole C,1.0 out of 5 stars,I completely regret this purchase,the United States,31-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Please dont waste your money on this TINECO cordless wey dry vacuum. There are so many other options you could try. You will regret purchasing this product its not worth it. You have to completely clean this everytime you use it. And it fills up so quickly you have to dump the dirty water out of it repeatedly during cleanin. I thought this combo vac would save me time. It does not, quite the opposite. My advice is to find one the separates the dirt from the water, so you don't have to deal with the gross murky water that ends up in the container after vaccuming.",One
Delina,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but small,the United States,12-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The iFloor wet dry vac is good because it is cordless and it does clean pretty well. The battery lasts quite long.  However, the wet/dry vac is small. The liquid containers, the one to put the water and cleaner in, and the one that sucks up the dirty water are both to small for me.  I do have a lot of tile floor and it becomes a pain having to dump both out and refill, etc.  This would be great for small apartments, homes, RVs.",
Katelyn Hebron,5.0 out of 5 stars,TINECO is a big YESSS from me!,the United States,29-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"REVIEW SUMMARY: IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT A VAC/MOP THE TINECO IFLOOR IS WHAT YOU NEED! SURPASSES THE BISSEL CROSSWAVE FROM WHAT I HAVE READ/SEEN. I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH THIS PURCHASE.I had been eyeballing mop/vac products for a while. I had heard a few people talk about BIssel, but I was extremely uneasy forking over that much money for something I had heard mixed reviews about. I will confess I am a TikTok watcher, and I somehow made it over to the cleaning video side of TikTok. I started seeing a ton of videos featuring the TINECO products and I even saw several that were doing a side by side comparison to the crosswave. In the videos the crosswave failed miserably compared to the TINECO iFloor. I pulled the trigger and pruchased the TINECO iFloor immediately after seeing the side by side comparison.I have never been so excited to receive a vacuum in my life. I was patiently waiting its arrival at my door. I was so excited that the day it came I happened to be working (ICU RN- 12 hour shift-exhausted) and when I came home I stayed up wayyy past my bedtime to try it out!It was the easiest thing to put together. The operators manual was concise and to the point. I had the iFloor vacuuming and mopping within 15 minutes of opening the box. I have 2 dogs and regularly vacuum my hard floors with a Shark vacuum, but the TINECO iFloor cleaned up dog hair I didn't even know was on my floor. The amount of dirt/hair and color (dark grey) of the water was incredibly disgusting, but satisfying to see. It made me feel certain the vac/mop was working at it's best!I think perhaps my favorite feature though is the self cleaning! after you are finished vacuuming/mopping you press the self cleaning button and it cleans the roller brush! You can also take off the roller brush and clean the crevices behind! The ""dirty tank"" and filters are easily cleaned by running hot water through/over them.My husband swears I'm nuts, but I use this thing every. single. day. I loathed mopping my floor, but the TINECO iFloor has changed my cleaning habits for the better!",

I was very excited after reading all ths good reviews, after receiving and trying this machine. I do not undersatnd how could people recommand it. It does not clean, specially not deeply or stains( used on tile floor). If you have pet hair even worse.. it requires a lot of Maintenance. You need to clean it after every time you use it and all the dirt ,hair ,mod exc stays in the plastic piece above the brush. It needs to be charged about 4 house for 22 minutes of opertaion.

Jill Hutton,5.0 out of 5 stars,only one experience with routine cleaning,the United States,14-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've only used this unit once for cleaning purposes: however I've used it several times on spills with very satisfactory affect. I had dropped an entire full can of soda which created a large puddle. I immediately grabbed this unit and used the suction first ( with very satisfactory results). Concern about  the stickiness of the floor I immediately utilize  the floor cleaning aspect. I was completely amazed, and surprised how thoroughly clean the immediate area was. All of my concerns regarding the stickiness of the floor was resolved. After drying the floor was clean with absolutely no residual affect of tackiness or smearing of the area I cleaned. Thank you",
Anonymous,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money...,the United States,12-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this... But it is probably the worst purchase I have ever made. The brush roll doesn't even touch the ground so there is ZERO ""scrubbing"". The water barely comes out unless you use the spot treatment, but it just squirts the water out and sucks it mostly back up without really cleaning the floor. The vacuum parts works ok on hardwood floors... But that's not really the point of the purchase...",

The first one was for me and this one is for my son. He borrowed mine and asked for one for Christmas. The value for the money is great. It is such an easy way to keep my floors clean. You must clean it regularly and do not leave dirty water sitting in tank or it will sour. You do have to fill the water tank and empty often, but the charge lasts quite a while. Great for regular cleaning or a quick clean up!",

Samantha,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for tile floors!,the United States,25-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I purchased this because a friend was raving about hers and kept posting videos of how great it worked. However I used it 3 different times hoping for each time that it would have a better effect and it didn‚Äôt. I will say that we do have a small portion of house that hard wood and is completely flat and it seemed to work okay for that. But the rest of our house is tiled and the tile is not smooth and it barely cleaned the surface of those floors. I ended up having to get down on my hands and knees and scrub a ton of spots. I am bummed and decided to return it.,

akf1003,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spend hours less cleaning!!! In LOVE!,the United States,11-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Buy it! If you want to maximize your efficiency then you must purchase this vacuum. I HATED vacuuming then mopping. I have a couple of dogs and a cat. I have enough hair to clothe 3 other naked animals. This machine picks up big clumps of hair and cleans the floor at the same time. I love how I can run over the kitchen floor after making dinner. The floor was left super clean and shiny! The tank fills up pretty quick but the cleaner is going to go a long way. The dirty water was terrifying. The self cleaning and the fact that it‚Äôs cordless make my heart happy. This was worth every single penny.,

I had such high hopes that I could reduce my cleaning time but I am not satisfied with this product.  It is a nice  stick vacuum--lightweight and quiet.

If you don't have a stick vacuum (and don't really want your floors mopped ) then maybe consider it, but I am returning it.",

I‚Äôm unable to get them to turn off so it does not properly clean my floor. Such a waste of money.. I can‚Äôt even return it now and I‚Äôm so so unhappy.  Back to the sweeper and mop.. yay.This gets allllll the dirt off the hardwood floors. It doesn‚Äôt completely soak the floor which is good. Makes them sparkle and look brand new!!!!

Elemotions,1.0 out of 5 stars,Way too much trouble for daily use!!!,the United States,13-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Poor cleaning. I wiped the floor with a paper towel after and still picked up dirt.Also, you have to empty reservoir and leave the whole thing disassembled until it dries completely or it will mildew and stink.So, basically, you end up with parts drying all over the place. This is extremely prohibitive to regular daily use.  NOT GOOD for me, anyway. I returned it, got a Hoover steam mop, and love love love it!!!!",
Julia K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best option for the price range,the United States,7-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this to use on my laminate since it doesn't use much water.  It was a little lighter and smaller than I expected, but compared to the major competitors, it's truly the best option I've found without wanting to drop $300+ on a floor scrubber.  I love that it is extremely maneuverable and battery powered.  The downside is the battery only lasts about 30-35 minutes, which is just about the time it takes to clean my floors so I sometimes need to recharge.  It also has rather small water tanks, so I have to refill at least 2 times throughout the cleaning process.  I find this is still worth it, because I don't have to vacuum and then mop.  I own dog, so I appreciate that there's no hair or dander left behind on my laminate.",
B,2.0 out of 5 stars,Works better as a vacuum,the United States,30-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We have laminate flooring throughout our dining room, living room, and kitchen. We have small children who almost always make a mess during dinner. Lots of crumbs. We also have a cat and a dog. I wanted this machine so that I could pick up crumbs, dog and car hair, and essentially mop at the same time. Unfortunately the wet portion of this is TERRIBLE. It sucks up crumbs and hair without issue but when it comes to actually cleaning the floor and removing dirt (you know the stuff that turns your socks dark) it does a very poor job. I have to use the machine and then break out my swiffer to finish the job or scrub the floor by hand. Also, you have to clean a lot of pieces ever single time you use the machine. It‚Äôs a pain in the butt. If the performance of the machine was better, I might not mind the cleaning maintenance of the machine. If I could return, I would.",

Apparently I cannot get technical support help or warranty because I am too far out,  And I didn't pay extra for the warranty.

Noah667,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaner,the United States,15-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for puppy accidents. So far this has exceeded my expectations. For smaller messes, being able to apply cleanser with suction in one step is a huge bonus.If you have larger messes, such as I had with my beloved elderly and incontinent pupper Daisy, using a wet vac first to rid the floor of moisture would probably be a good idea, especially if they are wood, to minimize wetness and gunk.Cleaning a dry surface is best, so even for spot cleaning, I towel up any ""moisture"" on the floor's surface. It also saves the machine from getting too gross. I have not observed much, if any, streaking. My floors are over a hundred years old, so I tend to be overly cautious, and I do a quick swiffing as a last step.I appreciate the cleaning it does without massive amounts of damaging water output. I can tell that my floor is clean and the wood surface remains pretty.",

IslandLissa ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good to have in your arsenal of cleaning products but does not replace a broom and mop.,the United States,20-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Decent vacuum mop but does not replace a broom and mop. Good for semi- daily cleaning. The vacuum works decently but does not suction up things the size of cereal or popcorn. It‚Äôs just pushes it around on the floor. I also have white tile floors so it‚Äôs easy to tell that the mop does not clean evenly. With effort the vacuum does get up some stuck on stains. I still need to use a broom and regular mop for deep cleaning and dirt along the edges of the floor. The daily clean up processes is easy but I little time consuming. I find my self having to clean the sink and floor where I dismantled and cleaned afterwards. It‚Äôs recommend to clean the vacuum after use and to let it completely dry so that‚Äôs why I said it was decent for daily use or semi- daily use. Overall the vacuum mop is good to have in your arsenal of cleaning products. Some of the best features I like about the vacuum mop is that it is cordless and suctions up small dirt very well.  I believe it said it was not recommended for the carpet but for me it vacuums from tile to area rug very easily. Which is the best selling point.,

My only complaint is that you have to press the button the entire time you vacuum or it won‚Äôt mop‚Ä¶ hurts my hand some afterwards. But for the price you can‚Äôt beat it. I was used to a roomba but I honestly like this better- my floors are perfect now. I will say- you‚Äôd still have to deep clean once every week or two (with mop and bucket) to get some of the goop and tougher stains out. But this is good for every day clean up. :)",

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,does not wash the floor,the United States,15-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"this product is reasonable however i wanted something that can wash and scrub the floors like the hoover max or the bissell does but with the heavy weight and cord.  the floor gets wet from the attached pad , but not enough to wash the floor. it would be great for low traffic areas and little messes like in the video. i think the suction is great for such a little Guy. but if you want really clean floors and if you live in a heavy traffic household , this is not the product to get unless you are prepared to do Dbl takes.",2
Nodakchic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Tiktok made me buy it,the United States,23-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Seen videos on TikTok about how great this thing cleans the floors. Charged it up over night and was super excited to wake up Saturday morning and get cleaning. What a joke, couldn‚Äôt even get the dog prints off the linoleum. It also kept turning itself off when I would use the cleaning solution trigger. The vacuum suction seems to be good and it gets the dirt and water sucked back up ok but the scrubber wheel just doesn‚Äôt scrub like I thought it would.",
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially Happy, ended with smoke",the United States,10-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Initially it worked pretty well.  It doesn't really scrub your floors, but for maintenance cleaning it worked pretty well.  Few weeks ago it started leaving more water on the floor than usual.  Today it would cut off after a few seconds.  Then it started smoking.  Bought this thing November 2019 and it's April 2020.  Used maybe once a week. Giving this two stars.  At this point it's up to customer service.  I'll update with my experience with them.",2
Pamela Zorrilla,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a happy consumer,the United States,16-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this floor cleaner just over 1 year ago. Now it doesn't work at all. It doesn't turn on,the light doesn't illuminate when plugged in and charging. Not a happy consumer üò°I like how light it is and easy to use. I don't like how the mop part works. The brush leaves dirty water on the floors. I clean everything after each use including the brushes and let them dry before using again which isn't convenient.  This is why I bought 2 brushes. The cleaning function for the brush on the wet dry vac doesn't work well, the brushes smell dirty even after using the cleaning function, so I wash and rinse them by hand. Like every other vacuum/mop it doesn't get into corners.",2
Jonathan Johnson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overall what I need,the United States,1-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"PROS:1. Super impressed with what this picks up! I don‚Äôt have to sweep before going to mop, and that alone saves me time2. Quick set up and clear instruction- I had this out of the box and testing it out on my floors in 10 minutes.3. Very quiet. My spouse works nights and I‚Äôm not afraid to run this while he or the kids are sleeping.4. Tackled dried spots- coffee, jelly ect. The spot feature was very effective with this.CONS1. The water container and spot to empty water are TINY. I have to empty and refill 2x to clean my kitchen. Still faster than a traditional mop, but an annoyance nonetheless.2. Water tanks and roller are tough to remove/ get into place after. The buttons seem like they are having trouble locking into place.",
Kat,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have tile floors and it works.,the United States,1-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I do really like this, i have been wanting one for months but could not make the jump til prime day deal.. i have tile wood looking floor so i was not sure how the scrubber would do with the grout lines. However it actually cleans pretty good, no its no deep scrub clean like a toothbrush but its no different than a mop if not better than a mop. I am really happy with my purchase. I even think the cleaning solution smells good.I included a photo of my floor when it was being put in just to give an idea of what kind of flooring it is.",
Ashley Raulerson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Really wanted to love it,the United States,5-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My fianc√© surprised me with this as I‚Äôve been wanting it for over a year. I did my whole living room and kitchen (LVP flooring). Although the tank had plenty of dirt in it, the lever to release product onto the floor only worked half the time. Then, when I did the self cleaning it splattered dirt and water all over the tray and the inside walls of the roller. I unfortunately returned it. Just gonna stick with my shark vacuum and microfiber mop.",
Sarah M. Soriano,3.0 out of 5 stars,Best for small area,the United States,23-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My first try, I loved this vacuum, then quickly changed my opinion. It says it stays charged for 3 days, but it quickly died by the time I finished one room. It started sputtering and spilled gunk all over my floor. I followed all the instructions. After I cleaned the mess, I continued cleaning but it left a murky film all over my floors. It is also a bit labor intensive. Every time you replace the water and empty the receptacle, you basically have to clean the whole machine. Gunk gets caught in the chamber under the roller. The roller comes off but, having a family with long hair, this was a ""clean every time"" chore. I think it is best suited for a small area.",2
Johnny Lloyd,1.0 out of 5 stars,"No quicker than sweeping, then wet swiffering",the United States,31-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this to see if we could more quickly or easily clean the kitchen floor. For ~$150, its not only not worth the money, but might even be a bigger hassle than regular cleaning. Vacuuming step was fine for the open floor, but it won't get the edges, and especially not corners. Didn't vacuum up pet hair. The mopping step is -- bad. The spray comes out erratically and unpredictably, and can leave puddles of gray water. If there's a spot of grime it either won't clean it up, or takes several passes. For every review that said how quick+easy this product is, I was shocked at how poorly it handled in person. Putting in the return now.",
Sarah Daron,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the quality I wanted for the price,the United States,11-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I own a cleaning company so I was really just looking for ways to make our cleaning more efficient. This has good suction and worked fine for my hardwood floors at home, but I found it doesn‚Äôt clean heavier/thicker messes. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm using it wrong, but it seems like not a lot of water is released so it doesn‚Äôt do a deep clean by any means. It‚Äôs also incredibly tedious to clean and you have to clean it after each use or it starts to smell. Not worth what it costs to me, but if you have the money and are looking for something for occasional use, this could be nice. I won‚Äôt be using it for my company, but I didn‚Äôt return it in time so I‚Äôm just keeping it for my house.",
TBAR Rescue,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the greatest,the United States,1-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I loved this floor cleaner at first. But after nearly a year of use, I am not so pleased. I was amazed at first how much less water it uses than the Hoover Floormate that I replaced with it, but now I realize that less water means less cleaning. I have a senior dog who sometimes pees in the floor, and when I clean it with this floor cleaner, it doesn't do a good job. It doesn't use enough water/solution to thoroughly clean and it also doesn't suck up the cleaning fluid sufficiently. I am finding that my floor still has a urine odor even after cleaning. To prove my point, I went over the floor with a Swiffer Wet today after cleaning with the Tineco, and the odor was gone. My situation is different, I know, but not all that uncommon for people who have elderly dogs. When I clean a floor, I want it to not only look clean but smell clean, and this just does not do the trick.",
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,So Disappointing,the United States,30-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really really wanted this to work.  The concept is amazing.  Unfortunately, Tineco has not quite master its quality.  I bought one and after the second use one side of the sprayers stopped working.  Luckily, I was able to return it and get a replacement one.  The second one worked great for a while, but yet again half of the sprayers stopped working.  I can only think that this is a design/engineering flaw.  I can't believe that this a fluke and I am the only one who got the two vacuums that did this.  It has great suction and moves around smoothly, but the mop part is why I bought it.  Until they figure out all the bugs, I don't recommend spending the money.  Even $50 is too much for this product.",One
dara,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not that great,the United States,19-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was very excited to receive this product however it didn‚Äôt live up to its expectations. I used this where I have vinyl floors, my kitchen, dining room, and entry way. Not a huge house. It‚Äôs almost like the vacuum wasn‚Äôt level because when I would mop with it, not all parts of the floor would get scrubbed/wet. But my other spin wave has no issue with it so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my floor. The battery died before I could actually finish mopping my areas. I had to keep going over the same spots to get it scrubbed/wet. The water tanks are very tiny too, I had to dump and refill twice before I even finished. I don‚Äôt recommend. Seemed cheap too. Sad to write this review, just wanted to save someone else from returning.",
ashley faulk,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hunk of junk after 2 months!!!,the United States,28-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this two months ago and although it doesn't get close to the baseboards I liked the machine. Especially for a household with 3 dogs and 2 cats, it made cleaning a breeze. I didn't even mind taking it apart and cleaning it every time. However, it has COMPLETLY stopped working. Had it plugged in to charge and it will not charge or even turn on. Really pissed that I wasted the money on this item and now have to spend more to go get its competitor.",One
Brenna Swartz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite item!,the United States,27-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"After doing a lot of research, I decided to go with the Tineco instead of the competitors. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I have 3 dogs and it helps keep up on my day to day cleaning. DO NOT use any other solution besides what comes with it. You can buy more on Amazon. My father-in-law accidentally put a different cleaner in the basin and I had to rinse with water about 20 times. Luckily I caught it before it was too late. The suds mess up the sensors in the machine that cause it to not work properly. Great buy!",
Frances,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't quite function as advertised.,the United States,18-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My house hardwood floors throughout. So, I thought this item would be perfect for keeping things clean.The vacuum part of it seems to ""burn out"" pretty quickly. It's a wireless vacuum that you charge. Even though I've followed the directions with keeping it clean after uses, it does not seem to vacuum very well. Also, the mopping feature does not always work when the mop trigger is squeezed.It's too bad, because I was excited about this item. It cost quite a lot to only result in being less useful than it advertised.I've gone back to using other cleaning products.",
Autumn,2.0 out of 5 stars,Clogs easily,the United States,16-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs a cute, little, high tech looking machine, but as much animal hair as I have in my home, it‚Äôs not that great. I have to stop every thirty seconds to unclog the filter because it loses suction. I‚Äôm so disappointed and sad. I was really hoping this would work as well as they said it would. Maybe my cats shed too much, damn them! Anyways, if you have over shedding cats, don‚Äôt waste your money. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass and you‚Äôll bitch the whole time you‚Äôre using it.",
Isabel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well for me!,the United States,25-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really like this vacum/wet mop. It worked really well and it is super light!

I unbox it, read a little bit, and with the little charges it has I deep clean my kitchen tile floor, just for fun. The results were amazing. Its lightweight and easy to maneuver. Sparkling floor with very little effort. The dual tank is so cool. You always use clean water and no more spreading dirt with a filthy mop.Tineco should design a brush with bristles to interchange the roll when you need to clean the grout between tiles.",
Taylor1,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,20-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have 3 small inside dogs, so I was very excited to receive this product after reading reviews and watching product videos, but I will probably not be keeping it. The suction of the vacuum part is expected; it does vacuum decently, but the mopping feature just doesn't clean my floors well. I did the paper towel test after spending quite some time on an area, but dirt was still picked up by the paper towel. I tried to get in the corners of my floor, but it just wasn't picking anything up. When I moved it, there would be a streak of water where the machine didn't fully pick it up. I can see where this product could be useful; it does do relatively what it's supposed to do, and it has a self cleaning option. After seeing the product in action, however, I was highly disappointed. In my opinion I just can't justify paying $200+ dollars on something that doesn't do as well as a broom/vacuum and a regular mop.",
JJC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect - especially for folks with limited strength,the United States,1-Jun-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this primarily for my 70 y.o. husband so he can help with housework. It is incredibly light and does an amazing job. We have a gravel driveway and drag a bunch of sand and pebbles into the house (plus two dogs who shed). I do sweep before using the cleaner sometimes 2x per day. I run my hand over the floor after it's dried and feel nothing - totally clean.  Even does a great job in my tiled entry, getting into the grout lines. My only kvetch is that it doesn't get right against the wall or cabinets, leaves about an inch. Easy to clean afterwards. Highly recommend this. Really want one of  their vacuum cleaners but apparently can't be shipped to Alaska.",
Tom,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent Wet Vac, But Not Great Dry Performance",the United States,8-Nov-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It's OK, but I'm kind of disappointed. I may return it.The suction when using it as a dry vac leaves a lot to be desired. I think this is made to be primarily a wet vac and I wanted primarily a dry vac.When using it dry, the filters clog up and need to be cleaned out well before the dust bin fills up. The suction isn't that great when it's dry, though it works well enough as a wet vac. The handle doesn't go completely flat, so you can't vacuum under beds, etc.I think if you want a wet vac, you'll be happy, but if you want a dry vac, like me, you'll be disappointed.",One

Kindra,2.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life was disappointing,the United States,11-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Used this product for 2 months before the buttery would no longer charge. After charging over night went to use the machine in my kitchen and a red blinking light followed by the machine shutting off kept occurring. Contacted Amazon who directed me to Tineco since it was beyond 30 days since purchase. Tineco literally talked in circles back and forth emailing asking me to complete tasks or check things I had clearly stated I had already done or checked. Nearly 200$ for something that worked ‚Äúokay‚Äù. I should‚Äôve stuck to the spin mop.,

Grandma Mary,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not perfect but I love it.,the United States,2-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like the fact that it always scrubs with clean water, unlike using a mop. For me, it is still hard to get used to cordless. I have used the scrubber 5 or so times now and I like it more each time. Got most of the functions worked out now. I have a dog, so I vacuum up most of the hair before I mop. I‚Äôm still amazed with the amount of grit that gets picked up even after I vacuum and use a swiffer before I mop.",One
Chickie Byrd,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product for the price,the United States,1-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Purchased after seeing a Tik Tok video comparing the brand with the Bissell Crosswave. For the price, absolutely does the job. I wish it had just a little more power but what impressed me is the self cleaning feature that left the roller looking clean after using on all my floors. I would buy it again over the Bissell hands down. Wood floors looked great and didn‚Äôt leave water marks or film. Uses very little water and still works well.",
Kathy A. Richardson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would buy again!,the United States,3-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love that this sweeps and scrubs in basically one step.  However, cleaning the dirty tank is not much fun. Need a pool boy for that.  If I did not dislike sweeping with a broom and dustpan so much I may make not have made the trade off.  However, for me, this is worth the extra effort.  Also, it is VERY important to follow the instructions and empty the tanks after each use!",
JL,4.0 out of 5 stars,good replacement to swifter,the United States,25-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,the battery takes 3 hours to charge. the sponge filter needs to be dry and clean or it will spread dirt. other than that it‚Äôs not made for a big home. something to have around for the spills and mopping floors instead of swifter. takes a lot to clean after use. i like the auto clean feature it‚Äôs nice and easy to pull things off to clean. will keep it but wish it didn‚Äôt take so long to charge. was in the middle of a clean when it died.,
Ashley,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE,the United States,20-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is so cool! And cuts cleaning time in HALF! I don‚Äôt care for that it‚Äôs hard for edges and corners but if you sweep those out it gets it up great! I couldn‚Äôt believe how much it got up! You do have to clean it all out after every use but again still cuts mopping and sweeping time in half. I love it! It comes with cleaning stuff & also a base to sit it on so water doesn‚Äôt get on your floor. And a cleaning brush for the mop.,

Francine,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not mop very well,the United States,22-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This product is based off a one time use. If things get better I will update my review. I was very excited for this product but I think it‚Äôs more of a spill vac/mop rather than casual Sunday clean vac/mop. When seeing that the tineco was coming in a week I decided to not clean my floors until it got here. I have tiled floor. The suction of the vacuum I have to say worked very well picked up all the crumbs from my 1 year old and all the loose hair of my cat no issue. But the mop I have to say slacked very much I had hardly any water coming out even for holding the button the entire time and going over and over in the same spot it seemed to have 4 skinny water streaks. I tried this. On my kitchen which is not a huge area I have to say I got it as wet as I could but still have a dirty floor (pictured) I‚Äôm going to try moping again and will update my review but as of now I would much rather vacuum and then use a simple sponge mop.,
Karen Ann,1.0 out of 5 stars,Device will not charge.,the United States,11-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This cleaner worked for less than 3 hours.

Stephanie,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's good.,the United States,5-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Works well only two things I don't like.1) The width of the cleaning track is about 4 inches.

Which means you have to hand wash the inch of flooring against the wall by hand.,One

It does clean the hardwood floors better than carpet I think anyways. However, my dogs fur clogs it up and that stops it from sucking up like it should. Mine does hold charge very well. So I have no complaints about that. In all honesty, it's not worth the hype. Save your money. If I could return it and get a refund I would....",
Shayla,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,11-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes for this vacuum but was extremely disappointed. It left streaks like the roller was barely touching the ground and wouldn‚Äôt clean up a tiny dirt spot. As soon as I turned it off the roller dripped dirty water as if it wasn‚Äôt sucking the water up? It just moves dirt around.I did follow directions perfectly, even the part where you can‚Äôt fully recline it, and tried troubleshooting with no dice. Just a poorly made product.",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Saddened,the United States,17-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"TikTok made me buy it. I waited so long before I hit the bullet and I was literally waiting at the door for this to show up. It did leave my floors clean LOOKING, but failed on the wipe test. It also couldn‚Äôt get off tough spots and didn‚Äôt reach into the corners AT ALL. If I had more space, I‚Äôd keep it just to have handy, because it is nice to clean up quickly. But you‚Äôd definitely need to vacuum first to get everything up in the corners before you use this. I‚Äôm better off using a regular vacuum and swifter‚Äîdoes basically the same thing.

Not that great at getting up the ""stuck on"" messes that sometimes happen.  I did have to go back over with my bono mop to get up the water it left on the floor.  Sometimes leaves small pool of water when the dirty tank gets a little full.  Bought in August 2019 and now, in March 2021 - it will not even charge and turn on.  Tried to call them - recording says they aren't taking calls due to the pandemic (really, a phone call?).  Have to send a message and wait I guess.",

Cindy Salcedo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible!!! A BIG let down!!!,the United States,10-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It stopped working properly about 3 weeks ago. It leaks the water it‚Äôs collected. I used a paper Towel to clean the leak and my floor was still dirty the towel was black. I checked another section of the floor that I had just ‚Äòcleaned‚Äô with a new paper towel and it was black too!

For as much as I‚Äôve seen this on the for you page I thought it was going to be stupendous. Does the same job as my steam mop. I do not feel that it really scrub the floors like a claims.

Mercedes Lowe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Add to cart now!!! Makes life much easier especially with a toddler!,the United States,3-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love this vacmop! It works great on our floors( vinyl wood & Linoleum). It's also much more affordable than the Bissell crosswave. I have messy kids and this vacmop makes my life much easier. Cleans up everything from spilt cereal to dirt and hair! You don't even have to pick up the cereal bits first which is awesome! I definitely plan on using this one for a while then I'll probably upgrade to the bigger one. As far as run time it runs about 20-25 minutes like it says on a full battery, but I've noticed if you use the spot clean function on it often it drains the power quicker but that's usually not a problem for me. I use this for my everyday mop but once a month or so I still break out the spin mop and do a deep clean with a little vinegar or bleach to get the base boards and to sanitize. If your reading this debating on purchasing it go ahead and give it a shot! I did and so far no regrets!",

Megan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for long haired pets,the United States,27-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This cannot be used just as a vacuum if you have a long haired pet. The hair will block the vent and cause the vacuum to stop picking up, which is what it is supposed to do if the container fills up with water. If you have a pet, you know that sometimes you just need to vacuum without mopping. This is not the vacuum for that.Additionally, the little wheels on the bottom pick up hair and get jammed.Might be a fine vacuum/mop if you're not a pet owner.",

Transition between the floor and rugs is awful ... I feel like it just throws the dirt.  Not great suction power.  Can we talk about how it will deposit the dirt you just sucked up and then turn it out on the carpet wet if you try and use both the wet/dry functions?  You also have to take out and totally dry the roller every times or else it will smell like a dirty dish towel.  I wanted to love this sweeper but it does not get the job done.,
Stephanie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice While It Lasted,the United States,9-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôm giving two stars because for a brief period of time there this product really was a huge game changer for me. I have twin toddlers and it was a huge help at dinner time. However it‚Äôs really a pain to keep clean, and then a month or so ago it just stopped working. Like will turn on, but the suction‚Äôs impacted and nothing will spray at all. Have had my husband take it apart and check it out and nothing seems off - functionality just quit. Now looking at other brands to replace.",
Robinlynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Vac,the United States,23-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this wet dry vac.  It does an amazing job on our hard floors.  While the motor went out after five months, Tineco replaced the entire unit no questions asked.  I also own the Bissell crosswave pet (purchased after my Tineco broke) and hands down, the Tineco does a much better job than the Bissell at cleaning up dried muddy paw prints and does not leave any streaks (I use white vinegar and water).  It is easy to clean and does not have any smell (because I dump the dirty water after each use). Tineco's customer service far exceeded my expectations.  The vac has made my life so much easier.  I have not had any issues with the battery life, suction or any other issues that 1 star reviews have.  For me  - it has been worth every penny I paid for it and more.",
Dee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tineco customer support is amazing!,the United States,18-Nov-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"When I got this wet dry vacuum, I noticed a weird burning plastic smell coming out of the machine from the very first time of use. I wanted to return it to Amazon but when I tried to figure out where that smell comes from, it seem to disappear, so I cancelled my Amazon return label. On the third try, the burning smell appeared again and was very strong, and Amazon return window got closed by that time. So I contacted Tineco customer support directly. I was amazed with how quickly they responded, it felt like that they wanted to resolve my issue even more than me. They replaced that defective unit very fast.And I'm in love with this wet dry vacuum! It's not very noisy, it's lightweight, it's cordless, it's very maneuverable, and also I don't have to deal with tangled hair on a cleaning brush (compare to other vacuums I own). I wish that the suction power would be a bit stronger but overall - I love this vac.",
Ashton L.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Price does not equate with performance,the United States,17-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Not impressed. I have tile floor and this leaves streaks. Not only that the suction wanes off after the first use. Having to take it apart and clean everything after every use is a pain. It has good cleaning abilities, not gonna lie, but it‚Äôs no where near what it should be. The tank does not hold enough ‚Äúdirty water‚Äù. But for the $189 price tag, I would have rather of gotten the Crosswave everyone raves about. It is lightweight, which is a plus. As well as it is quieter than most. Just overall, not satisfied with performance weighed with the price tag. Am returning.",
Michelle Maddox,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as great as claimed,the United States,12-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was very disappointed with this product. The reviews told of an awesome cleaning product. It does pick up stuff off the floor, but it doesn‚Äôt clean up the hardwood floors too well. However, it does clean tile ok. I have decided to use it on my front and back porches which both have tile. It doesn‚Äôt clean my inside floors good enough for my liking. Very disappointed.",
Laura groce,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cleans and sanatizes fantastically, but would love other features added!",the United States,20-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love the vacuum wet /dry action. I just wish it was bigger and came with a hose attachment like a vacuum cleaner.I love the fact that it's cordless. Makes it lightweight and easy to maneuver. The battery lasts a really long time. I have a 2500 Sq. ft home and I can do almost the whole house with one charge.I knocked off a star because a) not very big holding reservoir, so that has to be emptied a lot. If it gets too full, it begins to release the dirty water - yuk! b) I wish it had a hose to get corners and other smaller areas.It cleans and sanatizes the floors fantastically!",
Sandra E. Pallante,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect little floor cleaner for smaller areas,the United States,18-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have owned a few floor cleaners now, and this one does a good job. I like the fact that it's chargeable, so no cord to get in the way, or to unplug and plugin elsewhere. I live in a small home with wood flooring, so can do the main part of the house without having to recharge it. It picks up the dirt very well. You may not think so at first, but when emptying the canister that has picked up the dirt and water, you will see that it has picked up a lot!",
eze 1906,4.0 out of 5 stars,Super handy,the United States,22-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The main reason for this purchase was to get a lighter floor cleaner, I had an old one with cable that is much stronger  but weights a ton.Pros:,  super light, a kid can use it, the battery is more enought to clean 1000 sqft. Power is enought for a light scrub,Cons: could be a little more powefull,  the dirty container need to have an automatic shut off.For the price is an amazing product, costing like half the price of a first brand",
MarkCharmaine,5.0 out of 5 stars,You won't regret it,the United States,10-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is the best purchase I have made in a long time. How did I live this long without one? I even bought one for my mother for Mother's Day. Great buy and half the price of Bissell. I have tile, laminate and hard wood and it goes from surface to surface without a problem. My mom even uses hers on her covered back porch which is concrete. It's amaizing!",
Michelle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!!!!!,the United States,7-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It left dirty water everywhere! Wasn‚Äôt worth the money. I hated this item.,2
Ebony,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning tool,the United States,29-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Works great.

Sydneychewning,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoy being barefoot!,the United States,28-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I thought my floors were clean until I bought this.

I highly recommend this product!",One
Monty Leaf,4.0 out of 5 stars,Obsessed!,the United States,31-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing has become my new best cleaning buddy. We have tons of tile floor and previously, I'd have to vacuum, then go back over it with a mop. I can now clean all my floors in HALF the time that it used to take. It also gets the grout insanely clean! I use a capful of the Tineco Cleaning & Deodorizing solution and fill the rest up with either regular water or the Bissell Eucalyptus & Mint Demineralized Steam Mop Water...makes my house smell amazing! The suction on the vacuum is also really strong!The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because after one time of using the self-clean mode, I can't seem to get it to work again - it won't auto shut off after 3 minutes like it's supposed to. However, the clean-up is super easy. I just rinse the dirty water tank and filters, run the roller under water and let it air dry, and then use a paper towel to clean up any gunk left at the bottom. Takes maybe 5 minutes max to clean.About to move into a house with engineered hardwood floors. Will update after I use them there!",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars!!!,the United States,28-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Wow! First of all, I didn‚Äôt know my hardwood floors were that dirty. I swiffer and mop every other day and thought they were clean. NOPE! this machine has proven otherwise. I can now get rid of my steam floor cleaner! Shines floors up like new , while cleaning them and not having them soaking wet. Bonus that it is cordless and very quiet compared to the bissell. I bought the product used so it came a bit dirty. But it‚Äôs very easy to take apart and clean. I love the docking station, which has a self clean mode. Very impressed and you will not be disappointed if you purchase this machine.",
hannah,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough suction/smears everything around,the United States,1-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I purchased after hearing rave reviews on tik-tok and it‚Äôs safe to say it didn‚Äôt meet my expectations, I have taken it apart and cleaned it according to the instructions and left everything to dry but it still for some reason smells funny the next time I use it for the first minute. I have a Siberian husky and it is no match for his hair, I pre-vacuum with my regular vacuum and then I use this and it just seems to be smearing everything around, the canister hardly fills up. When I turn it off it leaves a puddle on my floor when it stops, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be clogged it and I‚Äôm unsure if it was just defective but I‚Äôve resorted to using a 15$ mop from target and wishing I would have saved the 200$",
Jean,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not last. Possessed!,the United States,15-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I bought this Vacuum just over a year ago. The vacuum will now not turn off and smells like it is going to explode. It‚Äôs currently in my front yard because I am terrified it will catch fire or explode.Update:Vacuum ran in my front yard until the battery died. Now if you plug it in instead of charging it turns on and does not turn off until you unplug it and the battery dies again. I have had zero luck with my warranty I purchased and I heard nothing from the manufacturer. I do not recommend this product to anyone!,
No name,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute Time Saver,the United States,28-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is an excellent product if you are busy and looking for something to do vacuuming and mopping in 1. It does not get to the edge of the floors so once a week or every 2 weeks I take a mop around the edges of the floors. This is still a HUGE time saver for my family!!! What used to be a 3 hour chore now takes me an hour. I would not recommend for deep cleaning but your daily vacuum and mopping needs absolutely.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,great value and works very well,the United States,31-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"unit works very well on hard wood and tile floors for light cleaning; it gets the dirt out of the grout line. easy to use and clean after use with the self cleaning mode. First battery charge lasts long enough to clean kitchen, living room, bedroom and hallway about 30 to 40 minutes. (approximately 600sq ft)it is preforming very good.",2
katrina ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was hoping for,the United States,5-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes for this wet mop but I was pretty disappointed. If there is any type of visible spots on your hardwood that need cleaning (ie spilled juice, dirt from paw prints), be prepared to go over it with the mop multiple times. In fact, it would be quicker to get a paper towel and clean it up that way. The battery life is terrible- since you have to go over the same area twice (once to spray the liquid and once to suck it up), it takes a long time to mop the floor and the battery doesn‚Äôt take that into account. Also, it leaves streaks all over my hardwoods, despite doing what the directions say to avoid those streaks. Altogether not happy at all with the purchase. I am now back to using my old school mop, which is much quicker and more effective.",
Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very sturdy and does a decent job cleaning my vinyl plank flooring.,the United States,8-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Pros: Made well, easy to use, cleans easy, self cleaning roller, light weight. Cons: Does a decent job vacuuming/washing my floors in-between mopping's.  The roller does not have enough pressure on the floor to get up grimy stains. Battery life is not enough for my 2000 sq ft of flooring. Overall I am happy with my Tineco. I wish the battery was replaceable.",
Joycelyn Sweeney,4.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed at first,the United States,5-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to use this, but it leaves streaks on the bamboo. It works great as a dry vac for quick pickups. You also have to take it apart and clean rollers, etc after which is a hassle. I wasn‚Äôt sure about it the first time I used it, but liked it better the second. It still left some streaks but a Swiffer got them up. I do think I‚Äôll like it the more I use it.",
nancy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just wow.,the United States,27-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I am amazing how well this cleans my laminate floors and kitchen tiles too. This machine pick up more dirt and things then my steam mop.  I was amazed how dirty the floor was even steam mopping it before. The suction isn't that powerful so the floors will be semi wet but it isn't too wet, just damp. With 2 corgis shedding all year around, this will pick up all the dog hair. It did clogged up but it was a easy fix to remove the dog hair. But I am very happy with this product and might even want to upgrade to the ifloor3.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stick to the broom and mop,the United States,17-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This product is not quiet as advertised. It has a constant whistle and is very annoying.I purchased the soap to go with this product because of an odor that I can‚Äôt seem to get out of it no matter how frequently and throughly it‚Äôs cleaned. Smelly water drips out onto the floor when trying to only use the vacuum feature. Not a great choice if you have pets. The per hair gets caught on the roller and pushed back out onto the floor.,2
Rachel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not really worth it, if you have pets, Do not buy!!",the United States,18-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It is ok but it is a huge pain to take apart and clean everything out with your hands every 15 minutes! If you have pets, do not buy! It is a mess! I wouldv'e been much happier spending a little more money for a much better product. I only use it if I absoultely have to, but I hate using it because it is such a gross mess to clean out so often!",
Amber Salinas,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would be perfect if it could reach the edges.,the United States,10-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was really excited to try this but was left disappointed. I was hoping to replace my vaccum and mop, but I'm definitely going to still have to bust my mop out to clean the edges of the floors because this doesn't reach them. It does a good job at cleaning up dog hair and debris while also cleaning the hardwood floor. It did not do a good job in my front entrance where the floor has grout. This is just my first time using it. I'm going to give it another week and see how it does, I'll give an update then.",
Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for the naturally tidy person!,the United States,3-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Suction and brush scouring power could use a little more oomph! Perfect for a female with high quality no ew factor!! Not meant for messy MAN anything!! Not being an emasculating female, but some messes need massive scouring!! If you are currently surrounded by testosterone harboring humans, this is certainly not the wireless vac/mop for you. SOME Ladies/Men will understand this, so hard, right now!! Otherwise, awesome product and the cleaning solution smells CLEAN!!",
RaeChole,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money or effort.,the United States,8-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have had this Tineco now for over 6 months, and every time I use it I am just irritated at how poorly it works. It doesn't get in any grooves or grout lines, it takes FOREVER to get spots off, and it doesn't break through dirt or pick up dog hair well at all. I have a small laundry room and spent a solid 15 minutes in there with this, and then had to go in with a Swiffer to get all the corners and edges, and still picked up a bunch of dirt from the cleaned area. The only good thing is that it is helpful and useful for very messy messes, like dropped eggs or broken jars of jam.Overall, I would not purchase it again.",
Kesh ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,19-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I anticipated this to be amazing due to the hype that was spread abroad on social media‚Ä¶ Sadly it disappointed me.

Eamts ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I bought something else,the United States,30-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this off tons of recommendations and I wish I bought something else. I have vinyl plank floors and low to no piling rugs. It takes a full charge to vacuum my 800stft  living area. And I still have to go back over with a broom. The mopping part is great for little areas but don‚Äôt mop before you vacuum first. It makes a mess and doesn‚Äôt suck it up.Overall, find something else.",
Lindsey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure how I survived without this,the United States,2-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôve survived this long without this product! I have dogs and kids and this is a huge life saver. It‚Äôs perfect for my hardwood floors, and the suction power is is great! I‚Äôm ocd when I clean and after using this I never see any traces of dog hair. It saves me so much time from running my vacuum and then mopping the floor. I use it all the time and it‚Äôs great for deep cleaning!!",
Kelsey Block,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty disappointed,the United States,21-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Pros: it's lightweight, it's cordless, it's small, it's a 2 in 1, it sucks the water upCons: the tanks are tiny! I can't even make it through my kitchen floor without having to refill the take and empty the other. The scrubbing power is pretty weak and it is definitely not a deep cleaning tool. Also, the battery on this vacuum doesn't even last long enough to clean the floors in my living room and kitchen, and mind you I live in a single-wide trailer house.Overall I'm really disappointed and I would suggest you not waste your money. Check out the Bissell version, I'm sure it'll work better for cheaper.",
Sandie J,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but‚Ä¶,the United States,22-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is a good vacuum and has great suction power. I‚Äôm happy with it as just a vacuum. I got this for cleaning up after my dogs which are long and short haired. Muddy feet, messy eaters, and dog hair all on the kitchen floor. I don‚Äôt like that everything it picks up goes into same container. I guess it‚Äôs my fault for thinking it would have separate wet and dry containers. No. So it gets clogged with the wet dog hair. It‚Äôs gross to clean since it won‚Äôt just pour out of the container and you have to use your hands. It‚Äôs more work for me honestly. Not impressed.",
Erin Sturgill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes floors look amazing,the United States,11-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Does a great job on my wood floors.  There are a lot of parts to disassemble and clean, which I do  after each use just to keep it nice.  I can clean all of my floors on one charge (about 30-40 min).  It cleans about 2 inches away from the baseboards, so I have to get those missed areas by hand.",One
Sammi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it to me.,the United States,9-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I use this thing almost daily. I clean the entire unit before and after use and it just smells musty. It doesn‚Äôt suck as much stuff up as I thought it would. I‚Äôm all around dissatisfied. I thought because it had such good reviews, that it would be a great product. I was wrong. I feel like I wasted almost $200 for something that could be done better by my 6year old and a broom.",

Pulled out the Tineco after picking up big glass pieces..3 swipes and it was cleaner than when it was dropped!,
Rayne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changer!,the United States,25-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love this vacuum mop.  I taught my kids how to use it, ages 14 to 19, and my floors stay clean now.  We always sweep first, then vacuum mop every night.  This makes it so my kids aren't leaving the floors a wet mess, the floors dry so fast, and the pet hair disaster is under control! I love this machine! My only regret is not purchasing it sooner.The only thing is, it doesn't get up along the walls, but other than that I love this.  Every Sunday I take the roller out and wash it thoroughly and remove hair to keep it fresh and clean.",
Riley Hill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beats the Floormate!,the United States,16-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've been a Hoover Floormate owner for as long as they've been on the market. With multiple dogs tracking in dirt, it was a must-have. Unfortunately, I don't think one of them has made it past the 6 month point and it constantly leaked everywhere. In comes this beauty. After having it for a month I am thrilled. It does a much better job, uses less solution, and it being cordless is really a plus. I have also been able to quit pre-vacuuming quite so much just making sure to get the large stuff. The filter is easy to clean and permanent. Time will tell if it lasts.",One
Gabrielle,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good not great,the United States,2-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Good product for a house full of hardwood. Doesn‚Äôt get large stuck on messes well such as dried mud, we have to get those by hand after using the tineco. Also, when the dirty water tank gets about halfway full it‚Äôs as though it comes back out onto the floor in large puddles. So then I have to empty the tank and re run over the spots it came out in. If you want the end all be all product, get the bissell. If you want the next best thing with a few hiccups, this one is for you.",
Jessica Wendling,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for us,the United States,24-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"If you don't have animals and kids I believe this vacuum would be great. I needed a vacuum for every day, multiple times a day and this is not for that. This is a perfect vacuum if you only vacuum and mop-like once or twice a week. I vacuum upwards of 3 times a day because we have 5 dogs and a toddler. This vacuum is great at picking things up however the cleaning/maintenance it requires is way too much. You constantly have to clean the parts and let airdry.",
Princesstedde,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an absolute life saver!  Love it!!!,the United States,26-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is one of the best purchases I have made.  It is up there with my cordless Dysen V-10.  I easily put it together the directions were great!  I have approximately 1100sq ft of laminate and ceramic tile.  This model works great for that.  If I had a bigger area to do I would get the newer version that is nice for a larger space.  My floors look beautiful!  I am 63 and washing floors does not come easy for me so this is an absolute lifesaver!,

Ashleigh,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good initially, but then...",the United States,5-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Initially I really loved this vacuum, unfortunately after only 3 months of light use the roller bar stopped working despite being cleaned. I have e-mailed the company and there is no roller bar replacement currently available, very disappointed to pay $214 for something I now can't use.

Carrie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hardwood and tile floors,the United States,3-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So convenient! Easily picks up debris on hardwood and tile floors and cleans at the same time! As other reviewers said it won't get dried on gunk but with the ease of cleaning with this I doubt I'll have any dried on gunk in the future. Yes, it has a small clean/dirty water recepticle but again it's so easy to empty and fill I didn't have a problem with it. It has a slim design so it's relatively light and easy to push. It's so satisfying to see the dirty water as you poor it down the drain!",One
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ok for what I wanted it for,the United States,18-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Like that it's cordless and wet/dry feature which is why I bought it.I love love my cordless Shark vac and will continue to use unless I want to quick wash floors too.

Ryan Van Duren,1.0 out of 5 stars,"More work that it's worth, especially if you move faster than a snail.",the United States,20-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Looks good, but I can't move it back and forth without the backflow cup blocking the airflow. Also it barely gets wet when trying to mop. I ended up having to hold the trigger the whole time and supplementing with a spray bottle. Only good thing I've found a use for it is when the kids spill a drink on the floor and I can just grab this to suck it up. Then I spend the next 10 minutes cleaning out the machine. Over-all I think I spend less time and energy using an old fashioned mop.",
Takephive,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for pet owners!!,the United States,4-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Love this vacuum!! We have two cats and a dog that shed constantly. The picture is what I get almost every time I vacuum. It shows the third time of vacuuming since purchase. Never knew how much dirt and grime was on my floors and we DID mop regularly. Our air quality seems better in our home too, and it‚Äôs so much nicer walking barefoot in the house. It‚Äôs a bit loud but totally worth it. Good battery life too. I hope it lasts awhile because so far, no complaints here!",
Nicole Taber,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great while it lasted,the United States,6-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I originally purchased in July 2019 by the end of the year it no longer charged.

It vacuums nails up ! Wood slivers ! All the Pet fur that the vacuum misses - when emptying the part where the debree gets sucked into - u really see just how useless regular mopping is . The floors can look immaculate and I‚Äôll use Themis machine and when I seee what comes out of it - it showed just how much was ungrabbabke by anything than this machine. Just take care of it.

Nikki Perez,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product!,the United States,28-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like this Vac/Mop, however, the only thing I don't like about it is if I needed to scrub something I'd have to pull out my regular Bona Mop. I've used this product for almost a month now. I love that even though I may miss some dirt, because let's face it, you can never get all of it, this Vac/Mop sucks it up anyway instead of just pushing it around like a regular mop.",
Terri Sue,2.0 out of 5 stars,Do not recommend: water just builds up,the United States,14-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I am in the process of returning this. I love the concept, but since the first use it has had an issue where the water just builds up in the roller area instead of going into the dirty water reservoir. I reached out to customer service and followed all of their troubleshooting ideas. I finally gave up and decided to return it and now have to pay a hefty restocking fee, which sucks. It‚Äôs better than keeping a faulty product I suppose. I would not recommend this model.",
Nicole P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite appliance,the United States,24-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Few things could have prepared me for my strong feelings for this vacuum.

Actually mops very thoroughly and because of the awesome suction, you‚Äôre not pushing hair, dirt, grit, whatever else around on your wet floors. Also, it mops really thoroughly but the floors are barely damp immediately after. I debated buying this for months and my only regret is not buying one sooner.",
Xlefty88 ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Darker Hard Wood,the United States,2-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Haven't used it long enough to determine the quality or cleaning capabilities yet, although so far it's not doing  what we were hoping it would do as it is leaving streaks on the floor, but I do realize our hardwood flooring is darker so most everything will show unfortunately.  might have to try different methods as in less cleaner vs. water used,  amount I'm spraying  out, etc.it does however pick up  debris as it should  and cleans well thus far, but still to early to tell as I've only  used a  couple of times..",
Israel Morales,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery doesn't last.,the United States,8-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I use the unit for a small apartment. I found that it doesn't clean deep, especially if the floor has raised grooves. I need to hit it from all angles and hold down the spray button the whole time to get it wet enough for. Good scrub. I do two rooms and the battery dies every time. I've used several different  solutions, you always have to dilute it or else the spary functions doesn't work well. My last dislike is the actual brush, I need it to have more thicker bristles to better scrub the floor not just surface clean it. The way it is not I have to clean the same area multiple times for a decent clean.",
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like mildew,the United States,22-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is great for small vacuum jobs on hard wood or tile floors. Not good on carpet that has any type of thickness. Once you use the wet portion is when there seems to be an issue. It cleans well when using the wet option but it smells like mildew after the first use. I had to use bleach to kill the smell. Not good!,One
Peggy B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,That it works great and most of all your back isn't killing you when you're finish.,the United States,8-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,First wanted to say I'm disabled.. iflood cordless vacuum and mop is great. It cleans your floods and leaves a shine.. you know there clean because the dirty water is separate from the clean water. I clean my kitchen and living room and my back doesn't kill me. One very important thing about it.. the weight.. it's not heavy.. but it works great great great.I could go on and on about it lol.. it's worth buying... wish I had known about it a long time ago.Peggy Brooks very happy üòä customer.,
Cassandra5683,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very unsatisfied,the United States,20-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing always smells like mildew even though I clean it as soon as I'm done. Even just vacuuming up stuff.  I bought the disinfecting cleaning solution and everything. Dog hair still everywhere still. After I'm done and abutting is dry,  I'm waking bare foot I still have residue on the bottom of my feet. I airways go back over my food with a swifter wet jet.",
Brittany,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted so much to love my tineco but I need to return it.,the United States,4-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was extremely excited about my tineco. I have a dog and my floors always have paw print marks or marks from people walking. I thought this would be great because it vacuums and mops. I usually vacuum before cleaning my floors however there is always little things that are missed and it‚Äôs great this does both. Now overall it was easy to set up and and I felt like it vacuum great. The issue I had was I couldn‚Äôt really tell if water was actually coming out and if it was really cleaning my floors. A single tank of clean water and 1 charge cleaned my entire house. Cleaning the mop after wasn‚Äôt the worst but definitely can be a pain for some people. My main issue is it SCRATCHED my hardwood floors. I wanted so much to love my tineco but I think I need to return it.,
Maria A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new toy!,the United States,13-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The vacuum mop is a great tool for our laminate floors. I love that you can do two things at once. The suction is good. Vac is well made, easy to use, easy to clean, easy to put back together and pretty compact to store. My floors get pretty yucky with two toddlers and three pets so it does take a few passes to get all the gunk off. I'm still learning the best way to use it for our floors but definitely happy with my purchase!",
Lisa Veronica,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for one (not extremely messy) dog.,the United States,30-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love that I can vacuum and mop all at the same time. You aren't able to use this very often on hard wood floors. The suction works good just not good enough to get enough of the water off of the wood if used to often. I have a dog and he has a few dogs off his own. And I need to clean every day. Most days twice. I need a quicker drying vacuum. If I had one or no dogs this would be perfect.,
A. Blanco,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not Perfect, but I Love it",the United States,11-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have all hardwood floors, a dog who sheds and goes in and outside all day, and 2-year-old. My floors always feel dirty. This vacuum is so easy to use and easy to clean. It‚Äôs not as effective as some vacuums and it doesn‚Äôt clean stains as well as a swifter did, but it‚Äôs so much easier and more cost effective. I am very happy so far.",
Amber Hettinger,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,the United States,26-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,My floors are still dirty even after I‚Äôve gone over them a couple times with this version of tineco. When you turn it off it leaks and leaves behind a small puddle of the dirty water(no matter how much water is in the tank) I take it apart and clean it like you‚Äôre supposed to each time but it doesn‚Äôt matter. It sucks because I was hoping it would be better,
Coty May,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good at all,the United States,30-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Item came broke but found a replacement part because it cost to much to ship back. But as you can see it does not have very good suction and just picking it up leaving piles of water behind. It also does not clean anything that has been there for a while and is hard. So this only works if your just mopping a dirty floor but if it has been on there for a long time it does not work at all.,
Jacie leavy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent product for the price,the United States,6-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It works good if you want to refresh your floors but if you want a deep clean look elsewhere. It doesn‚Äôt get to the baseboards so that‚Äôs a extra step you have to do after your done. It doesn‚Äôt get my floors as clean as I‚Äôd like but it works for the time being. Cleaning the parts afterwards is a hassle and it drips all over your floors rolling it back to the charger. The company knows this product leaks yet they still put it out on the market.,
J Frankart,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not recommend, produces bad mildew smell",the United States,7-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I decided to try the Tineco iFloor after we moved into an apartment that has mostly tile floors. When i first got it, everything was good and it performed perfectly. Fast forward not even a month later, and it starts producing a horrible mildew smell. Reach out to Tineco for support and they give me a label to ship it back and get it repaired. They send me my unit back, and they did not even repair the correct thing and the mildew smell still occurred. So now I contacted Tineco and they agreed to send me a new unit (turns out to be a refurbished unit), and now not even 2 weeks later it is producing the horrible smell (keep in mind i clean after each use). I do not recommend the Tineco iFloor, it‚Äôs good at the beginning but after a bit it does not perform as well as it should.",
Far Left Texas,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't clean as well as I had hoped,the United States,18-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We tried this, didn't really like it, and had planned on returning it, because it doesn't really clean the tile floors that well.  But I missed the return deadline - ARGH! - so now it lives in a closet, never to be brought out again.",One
Brandi Denmon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does not deep clean!,the United States,4-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"At first I was really impressed but after a month of using this product, I'm less impressed.  It leaves dirty water on my floor, it doesn't get to corners or the sides of the floor by the wall, cleaning this product is a Hassel within itself, it reeks even if you clean it every time, and it does not deep clean!  I just used my wet jet on my floor AFTER using my Tineco and my wet jet still picked up dirt and nastiness off my floor.  What a waste of money!",One
jocey szmidt,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe okay for small spills,the United States,19-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like that this wet/dry vac is cordless, lightweight, has a self cleaning mode and somewhat quiet.  However, it's not as good as the crosswave.  I run a small doggy daycare and have to clean accidents all day long.  This vac doesn't cut it.  I don't feel it dispenses enough liquid to clean up a mess.  I'm still spraying additional floor cleaner to help disinfect my floors.  Overall, it might work for one person with no pets, but for my family of three plus two or three dogs, doesn't cut it.",
F C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,the United States,2-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Best floor cleaning device I've ever owned. It's light and easy to use. No cord is great. I use it all the time. I'll scrub the floor with a tank with a cleaner, even works with Simple Green. Then I'll give the floor a 2nd pass using hot water. The end result is a floor clean enough to eat off on. It's great for quick pick up cleaning, too.  I live in studio apt so it's perfect. It could work for any large room. Hopefully, this thing will work a very long time and if and when it finally wears out, I'll buy another.",
Kpsunshinegirl ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient,the United States,31-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is convenient for two in one (mop and vacuum).  I wouldn‚Äôt consider it a deep clean.I like using it and add a little fabuloso to the mix they provide.  Makes the house smell nice.  But I have 2 transfers so that doesn‚Äôt last.  HahaIt is high maintenance to clean up and take all the parts out and clean.,
Stephanie G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy,the United States,3-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,So far I love this product. I was really interested in a vacuum/mop when I came across the bissel cross wave. This brand was much more affordable and came with great reviews. So far I love this product! The suction is great and the mopping aspect is as well. The only thing I did notice is the cleaning agent that was provided has discolored my wood floors in some spots. I will look into another cleaning agent for the wood floor (if possible) but all in all this has been a game changer. I love it!,One
MiamiMe,5.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATE: Better than 5 stars,the United States,4-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is an UPDATE to my original review:  Better than 5 stars!After a few months, a piece broke off from my clean solution cup BUT they sent me a new machine.  THEY HAD RE-DESIGNED the iFloor's clean solution holder.  The plastic parts were replaced with hard rubber for the release/ catch portion.  MUCH better!!!!  I suspect this was a common problem and the company listened to their customers instead of denying responsibility?I love my iFloor unit - see my earlier review after just receiving it.",
Jennifer L Stephens,5.0 out of 5 stars,My floors are cleaner than ever,the United States,15-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Was skeptical of buying a mop vac but was tired of dragging out the mop and bucket to clean my floors. I wanted a cordless unit and read so many reviews. I decided to give the tineco ifloor a try. I'm so glad I did. My hopes weren't high but to my surprise my floors were squeaky clean. I have 1100 square feet of all tile to clean and it did the job better than expected. Did I mention that I have 5 pets! I was able to clean the entire house on a single charge. The clean up was not bad either but what came out of the dirty tank was horrifying. I can not believe how much dirt is trapped on the tile even with a daily vac. The unit is lightweight, easily maneuvered throughout the house, and even cleaned area rugs. This unit has made household chores much less time consuming and left the floors much cleaner.",
Pam M.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a powerful cleaner.  Very small cleaning head and capacity.  Disappointing.,the United States,22-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Tried this product based on the stellar reviews.  Can't hold a candle to the Hoover units.  (I have two different models).  Thought this would be a handy replacement for the oldest one since this is cordless, but will keep it just for emergency spot cleaning.  The soap and rinse tanks are very small.  Barely handled my kitchen floor.  And as others noted, it does not ""dry"" the floor.  The instructions also state: ""use on a rough service may not get the best performance"", where my Hoovers can be used on a raised pattern vinyl floor and has separate brushes to really get them clean and still does a better job of drying the floor than this product does on a flat hard surface floor.It is light and appears to be well made with clear instructions, which is why I gave it 3 stars on the review and not lower.  Too bad.",2
Holly west,2.0 out of 5 stars,H,the United States,14-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like the vacuum part but the mop part is not good at all atleast for my vinyl floors. It doesn‚Äôt do good at mopping at all. The vacuum part is fine and I still use it as my vacuum but I bought a steam mop instead that actually cleans my floors. Cleaning the vacuum is a huge ordeal and hassle, you‚Äôre supposed to clean after every use and the brush is the most difficult to clean. Hairs get stuck on it and they gave you a piece to get the hairs off with but it‚Äôs still just a mess. I got this bc I seen a video that said it works better than the bissel cross wave which I can‚Äôt comment on bc I don‚Äôt have that but I don‚Äôt recommend this if you have vinyl floors and need to mop. I was a bit disappointed that my floor is still so dirty after mopping.",
chris bagley,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work as expected.,the United States,24-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Got this so I didn't have to get on my hands and knees to scrub my toddlers food off the floor and it does not help. It's always clogged and I can't keep it from clogging no matter what. I clean it daily and it still smells. Returning it, maybe the more expensive one works better? I'm going to try it but I don't have high hopes.",
James Dawson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Advertising is bogus.,the United States,13-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"These reviews are bogus. It may clean superficially, if your floor is barely dirty. So disappointed. If there are any spots on the floor they will still be there once the machine has went over it. If any food particles have dried on the floor, this machine will leave it where it is at. Even holding the brush over stubborn spots does no good.",
Elizabeth Chaffee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy and light,the United States,21-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Have not had it long but with a long rainy Spring and a dog it has been great. I really like the self cleaning feature. Rinses brushes after use. Very easy to use & light weight.,5
Barbara Clements,5.0 out of 5 stars,Is to Use,the United States,15-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I like how easy it is to use. I started cleaning houses for people and it makes my job faster and my customers love the floors when they come back. The only downfall is you can usually do one tank of solution at a time and the batteries start to drain. I‚Äôve just learned to schedule my cleaning routine to make it work for me. Hi on the flooring store is sold floors,
Sav,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pet hair seems to clog it,the United States,22-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was SO excited to get this and try it out. We have 4 big dogs inside so there‚Äôs quite a bit of dog hair. However one day in a small section I tried it out, and the dog hair seemed to clog it to where it didn‚Äôt want to suck water back up. Plus cleaning all the hair back out of it was interesting. These dogs are short haired too. So they don‚Äôt have long or thick hair. So if you have pets I would sweep before using this on your floors! Otherwise it‚Äôs a great mop",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fiance and I fight over who gets to clean the floors,the United States,4-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Just moved into a brand new home with laminate floors. I have two medium to large size dogs and since the home is brand new, the backyard doesnt have any grass yet and it has been raining like crazy. I was LOVING my home the first two weeks, but it quickly got old trying to clean the floors with a swiffer or mop. I was seriously starting to hate these floors. I started to look at electric mops but that didnt really solve the issue of getting the water up off the floor so it didnt ruin it. I came across this and the competitor version and quickly went to youtube. I decided to give this a try after a particularly wet weekend. I love it, I cant live without this thing. Im not quite excited to having to clean the floors almost every day, but at least with the iFloor, I don't mind it.  My only gripe is I wish the compartments were bigger to hold more water and waste. I will go through 5-8 fillups a day. All in all, worth the investment, hopefully it will last much longer than some of what the other reviews have indicated.",
Rhodes1021,2.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely keeping my crosswave!,the United States,28-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have 4 kids and a dog, so you can imagine how dirty my floors can get.

I was shocked since everybody I saw said the Tineco was a lot better at cleaning. I was so disappointed and returned it and decided to keep my Bissell. I also felt like it was cheaply made.",
M. Woodruff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing since sliced bread!!!,the United States,22-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Just what I was looking for as a mop/vac. Easy to use and clean. It is amazing the color of the water when I finished cleaning the floor. Plenty of runtime between charges. Excellent product that we use often on our wood floors. You will be amazed how dirty the water is that collects in the storage tank. Vey easy to clean and use. Customer service is also 5 Star. Had a problem with my unit and within few day a replacement unit was delivered for no charge. One of my best purchases ever from Amazon. And now they have several newer models with increased power and run times.,
Chelsea,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware,the United States,9-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was beyond excited to receive this... like a dream come true... and for the first two weeksIt was. I seriously was the most hyped I‚Äôve ever been in this Cinderella life. But then the trigger button became stuck. No longer does this function at all. I tried to contact TineCo direct before during and after the 30 day window and it only replays a message of how they‚Äôre sorry they‚Äôre not answering calls at this time.Since this is all I have to go on... I‚Äôm disappointed to have to report Buyer Beware.,One
Sally,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,the United States,24-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I got this for my kitchen floor because I read a review that is was comparable to the bissel  crosswave. It doesn‚Äôt clean well at all. Can‚Äôt really use it like a vacuum because it clogs very easily, so I try to use it to mop and it doesn‚Äôt even clean up the dog paw prints.

J. Lazarus,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible purchase,the United States,12-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Spits dirty water out as you are mopping! My friend recommended it at it‚Äôs the biggest waste of money I‚Äôve ever seen. There isn‚Äôt hardly any suction and it can‚Äôt handle mopping and vacuuming at the same time. I purchased this product back in March and it never worked. I had thrown it out in the garage and forgotten about it until I saw it the other day while cleaning the garage out. Biggest purchasing mistake ever.,
MamaToMemphis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but don‚Äôt throw your mop away",the United States,13-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"TikTok made me buy it! I wanted a Bissell Crosswave but couldn‚Äôt justify the price. This is a happy medium. My first iFloor was defective, but customer support was excellent and got a new one sent out immediately so no complaints there, it happens. I really like the self cleaning mode. I have a 1 year old and am constantly cleaning spills. It‚Äôs good for a quick clean up but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the most thorough clean, so you‚Äôll still need to mop occasionally. I do not like the floor cleaner they provide, I definitely recommend using your own. All in all, a solid product for the price point.",
Misse&Ren√©e,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth the money!!,the United States,24-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is Amazing! We love it! Very lightweight, easy to use, maneuver and clean! The only issues we have is that the battery doesn't last as long on scrub mode (which I had on the entire first time using it, üòÜ) and it has a small dirty water compartment needs to be dumped often...We did not care for the cleaning solution it came with, it made our hardwood floors filmy. But not a deal breaker. The stand is very nice and convenient. Definitely worth the money!! Saves so much time and effort.",
G. Baird,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but ...",the United States,21-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is a great machine to clean wood floors, because it doesn't get them too wet.  I still prefer to use a regular mop to clean tiled floors, though.  One problem - this doesn't clean up to the base boards, so whatever you clean, you need to go over the sides again with something else to clean properly.  We use it a lot, but just do the sides separately.",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,2-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It is very easy to put together, with simple and easy instructions.Does the job needed in terms of mopping up the entire area.

Ryan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Won‚Äôt stay charged,the United States,28-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,When I first got product it worked as described and I was very happy with it.

Mary J. Littrell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,25-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Makes me able to clean all my floors without much effort and they look great afterward. I was getting unable to clean them good with a mop or Swifter. The cordless feature is wonderful.,One
Martex,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected! Disappointed,the United States,28-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Not for a large area.  This is very small and takes forever to clean a large area.  Sprayer has 4 Streams and doesn‚Äôt wet the area well. Therefore you have to go over the same area several times to get the area completely wet/ clean. Suction is good , I haven‚Äôt used it for deep cleaning because the solution stream is spotty.",
K Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than my Bissell,the United States,7-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I bought this after my Biswell crosswave bit the dust. I love it!!!

Would definitely buy again!!!,One
Melina Craigo,2.0 out of 5 stars,Is not very effective at mopping!!,the United States,4-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This does not work as well as others have stated. I‚Äôve tried cleaning multiple floors in my home and am very unhappy. It‚Äôs slower than mopping and way less effective. Mopping with hot water does a better job. I mopped up muddy prints from my dogs coming in from rain. It took me going over it several times. If cleaning up a spilt liquid, it would be ok. But used for mopping purposes, it is not. I will rarely use this. Added a pic of my kitchen floor after going over the floor about 10 times and approx 5 minutes. Awful!",
BrandoB,1.0 out of 5 stars,Clogs often,the United States,2-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Product works OK, but clogs often. This makes it easier to use a traditional broom / mop than it is to risk needing to stop and unclog half way through cleaning our kitchen. We do have small children and dogs, but clean the floors nearly every day. Other products we've tried have not had this problem.",
Daniel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for someine ok a wheelchair,the United States,11-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I do like it as I am in a wheelchair and having a cordless allows me to keep my house clean. The only problem that I have had with it is it there is a button you have to press on the bottom of the unit and it opens up in it where you have to clean it. It does not open easily. Other than that it‚Äôs fine,
Freebird,5.0 out of 5 stars,Actually cleaned stubborn floor,the United States,20-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôve had a major problem with the wood floors turning feet black no matter how much I swept and mopped and scrubbed.After using this, I no longer have that problem because my floors are actually clean!Don‚Äôt fill the clean water tank to the max line. Leave it a little below because if the dirty water tank gets too full then it dumps all over the floor. The sound changes a little right before it does it and you have to be quick to turn it off. So just don‚Äôt fill the clean tank up to the max line and you‚Äôre fine.",
Serea,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt work,the United States,22-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I raved about the Tineco for months, I continually stared at it online between  Amazon & Tik tok & once I finally gave in a few months ago and ordered I was very unimpressed. I keep mine very clean, yet it still barely works. My tineco leaves streaks, a smelly scent is left behind, and it barely sucks anything up. I am very unhappy with this & if I I could try a new one, or get a refund on this one I would in a heart beat.",
Isa,4.0 out of 5 stars,The best thing ever,the United States,21-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really enjoy using this product. I have tile and it cleans it perfectly. This beats traditional mopping. If you don‚Äôt mind having to be filling up the water tank & tossing the dirty water it‚Äôs a win! I bought this because I‚Äôm pregnant and I did not want to have back pain due to mopping my floors. It‚Äôs made such a difference. I feel like I look forward to cleaning the floors!Only downside:My charger stopped working and so I haven‚Äôt been able to use it because I‚Äôm waiting on the replacement. It is taking a LONG time to get to me which is unfortunate because I‚Äôm back to regular mopping. :(( I hope they are able to ship it out soon.,

Cristopher Zelaya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Say goodbye to your mop,the United States,23-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Great for dog hair and the fact that you skip the mopping part afterwards is awesome. Baterry is more than enough for our 1100 sq ft. Home, the outo-clean function is great. Cleaning the vacum is straightforward and easy. While there is a brand with a better system, the pricetag of this one puts it right up there in terms of performance.",
Sarah Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like so far,the United States,18-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I've been using it a month and like it so far. It lasts quite a while but I don't think you can do a whole house with one charge. I saw a YouTube video comparing it to the crosswave and in some cases it outperforms the crosswave and $100 cheaper. Also the cleaner it comes with smells great!,One
Rita,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great mop,the United States,18-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love that it is cordless and it does a really good job.  It's light weight and so easy to maneuver.  It's also a lot more quiet than I thought it would be.  We have tile floors in a lot of our house that are pretty rough and I wasn't really sure what kind of job it would do but it gets the job done.  This is way better than using an old fashioned mop or even a swiffer.  It's super simple to clean and doesn't take up a lot of room.,
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,DONT BUY!,the United States,17-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This item sucks!!! I‚Äôm so disappointed, I got rid of my steam mop in hopes of cutting out one of three steps to clean my floor. I was sure the people that gave it a bad review didn‚Äôt read the directions well enough or had beyond filthy floors. Well I guess that‚Äôs me, the ONLY nice thing about this vacuum is that it‚Äôs cordless, the suction is worse than the $20 vacuum I got from Walmart 4 years ago, & the mop function might as well be a regular mop moving dirty water from one area of the house to the next. This is the first time I‚Äôve used it & I‚Äôve already started the return. Beyond disappointed with this purchase. Now I have to buy a new mop & will have dirty floors until I can get something different.",
Morgan C,3.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelmed,the United States,12-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This was a disappointment. The vacuum feature works well but the mop is terrible. I went over spots slowly and multiple times and the floor was still wiping up dirty. My kids spilled a sticky liquid and I wiped it up and then went over it with this multiple times and it still dried sticky.It‚Äôs pretty easy to clean and the vacuum is strong but it‚Äôs not saving many anytime because the mop feature is so poor.,

Lindsay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for mastiff owners,the United States,16-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We recently bought our first house with beautiful hardwood floors. We have a mastiff who drools and sheds all day, and it doesn‚Äôt matter how often we sweep or mop, we can‚Äôt keep up. I don‚Äôt have the patience to bring out the mop bucket every day so I was looking for a better solution. I almost bought a robo vac/mop but all the reviews I read led me to this product. My biggest concern is that whatever I got would smear our dogs drool rather than clean it up (that‚Äôs what our swiffer wet jet does). I will say this definitely gets his drool up with ease in case anyone else has that concern. I love the convenience of this thing and would recommend it to anyone with a hardwood floor and pets, or messy kids. The one thing I wish I could change is the scrubbing power. Simply because our floor is dark and if our dogs drool dries on the floor there are little water spots everywhere that don‚Äôt come up with the vac alone. I don‚Äôt think the average person would have this issue though.",
Abby L. ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuums great. Mop? Not so much.,the United States,10-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this vacuum as I had heard great reviews about it on social media. Upon first use of the vacuum I found that the ""mop"" aspect of the vacuum only works really well when you first start it. It lets a lot of water out immediately upon starting, which is perfect for those spills/wet dog paw prints, but after a few minutes of use it does not release a lot of water. I found that I have to keep turning it on/off to get the ""deep cleaning"" as advertised. The instructions say to pull the vacuum back while pulling the trigger for added water, but I don't find my vacuum lets down any additional water. I have turned it on high/spray with the same result. It could be operator error, but I have read the instructions and it appears I am doing everything correctly. If you are happy turning it on/off frequently you will have no problems. However, I do have a long haired doggo and it picks up smaller clumps of hair, but will often struggle with larger hair areas. For the most part the vacuum is adequate, but I think I will rely on my steam mop to get that polished floor effect.",
Samantha,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money in my opinion,the United States,14-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"For $200 I thought it would be something absolutely amazing. It's so so. Not great, not horrible. Small water tank so it takes me forever to get all my floors done. Used it near my pellet stove where it gets dusty/ashy faster. It left bad streaks in that area. And yes I used the cleaning solution it came with.",
Daniel Shown,3.0 out of 5 stars,It takes many passes to get any junk off the floor,the United States,28-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really like the lightweight feel of this little vacuum and the ability to mop and vacuum at the same time. I also really like that it is cordless! However, with all of that being said, it's suction feels a bit weak after having a Shark vacuum. The ability to get into corners is gone without pulling out another vacuum or broom to clean corners and edges. The vacuum seemed to spit out debris when lifted up and still running. And finally, while the mopping function is great it takes so many passes and possibly a towel to pick up any kids messes which was my point when I decided to get it. It has only been one day so I will do an update if I somehow see an improvement. Overall, it is just okay.",
N.Toor,4.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs an ok mop,the United States,7-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is ok it‚Äôs great for everyday clean up but I will still be using my steam mop a real deep clean weekly!

Jcfl160,5.0 out of 5 stars,great value and quality,the United States,6-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really like this machine. I was looking at another brand and happened on this one. It caught my eye as it was cheaper with better reviews. I have no complaints. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. I cannot believe the dirt it is collecting from my floors. I see complaints of streaks but they dry quickly. I barely notice as I would expect some wetness due to the nature of the cleaning. You do need the empty/clean it frequently but that may be a factor of how much dirt it encounters.,

Ali Sha,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible,the United States,8-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this vacuum because I like the double feature. So when it arrived I was super excited to give this baby a whirl. I charged the vacuum like instructed. 4 hours later I go to use it. I am extremely disappointed with this product. First, maneuvering this thing is a little hard. It is light weight, but turning the head is not seamless. Second, after I vacuumed an area and pulled the vacuum back, it spit out everything it just sucked up!!! Honestly it was easier to just sweep and mop the ""old fashioned"" way. This product sucks, and not in the vacuum kind of way. I cant wait to get my money back so I can buy the Hoover Linx!",One

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but gets clogged,the United States,17-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have 2 large dogs that shed a lot & was looking for something that wouldn‚Äôt just stir up the dog hair like a broom. It works great and is very quiet. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because it gets clogged up and I have to clean it after about every 5 uses which is kind of gross. I think the problem is the amount of dog hair I‚Äôm sucking up and not the product itself though.,

I was hesitant to order the Bissell version due to the super high price and short battery life.I was so excited when I found this one for a fraction of the price and it was everything I wanted (cordless, rechargeable battery, lightweight, mop & vacuum).

Got a replacement set it up and ran it for the first time. It kept shutting off and wouldn't allow the spot cleaning to work nor would the water actually spray out but just did its own thing.

I did give 2 stars as it did an amazing job cleaning yet didn't work to the full potential,
LetsBeHonestMomma,2.0 out of 5 stars,I must have a dud...,the United States,17-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so incredibly disappointed!! My tineco barely puts out any washing liquid to the point it looks like you swiped a barely damp rag on the floor. The suction, fully charged, is barely minimal. The bissel power sweeper does much better. I really wanted something to help make daily cleanup less time consuming and instead it‚Äôs just incredibly frustrating. Nothing looks clean and I‚Äôm so disappointed. There were so many great reviews I can only wonder if I received a defective machine.",

I saw other reviews saying the same thing and thought it might be user error. The manual says to overlap at least an inch to prevent streaks but it still left them.

I am sweeping and mopping my floors with one hand and playing on my phone with the other. Sometimes I do it twice a day, even though there may be no dirty or grim on the floor. It just seems a bit therapeutic for me at times. The only thing is that sometimes it won't get those little pieces of trash or gunk against the wall, but I personally don't mind it much.",

It no longer sucks properly, gets clogged every use (I just vacuum crumbs), and when using the mop function it doesn‚Äôt spray out water consistently and when it does it puddles up dirty water and spreads it around the floor. I followed all of the instructions and clean it after every use. Don‚Äôt waste your money! Splurge on a better one. I‚Äôm a mom of two and a good dependable vacuum and mop is a necessity!

My kitchens not very big but I can‚Äôt get through cleaning it without having to pause and clean out the entire machine, not just the dirty bucket but even the bristles and vacuum. It gets clogged up by barely anything. And if you don‚Äôt have it standing up slightly the water portion barely works so you have to work in extremely small sections. It‚Äôs just a disappointment.",

I have had no issues this far and I‚Äôve had it for over a month.

Kay Gee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall a great peoduct,the United States,22-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So... been reading up on this product for a while. Gotta say it‚Äôs a good product it cleans not hardwood floors well, super easy to use, super light and suction power is great. I did use it once for deep cleaning as a had a dried on sticky spot on my floors, wasn‚Äôt as expected, spot didn‚Äôt disappear but I wiped it off with a paper towel fairly easy. Overall... great product, easy to use, easy to clean afterwards and storing it was nice as it fits perfectly in my pantry.",
Donna ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for keeping the main walkways and kitchen floor clean.,the United States,30-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This little machine definitely works well. I love the fact of only going over the floors one time and it is so light and easy to use. We have multiple pets so I still need to vacuum or sweep thoroughly twice a week. But the tineco gets all the little bits and washes the floor well with little water. I had just mopped the day before we got it and when I tried it out the water was so dirty afterwards in the catch container. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a deep cleaner, only because it doesn‚Äôt get near the edges very well. I did try it near the litter boxes and it picked up the litter and cleaned the area very well.",
Hailey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing! Best buy of the year!,the United States,23-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really love this! It's everything I hope it would be and then some. I have 2 boys and 2 dogs who love to play outside. This cleans up the dirt, leaves, and foot prints all in one. I can cut down my cleaning time by so much. I definitely recommend this.",One
Salty s,2.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATE.  DEAD BATTERY = MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.  ONE YEAR LIFE.  Lightweight pros and cons,the United States,7-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Updated reviewAfter one year non replaceable battery will not take a charge.  Unit is rendered useless.Does what it says it will do.  Over wetting can leave streaks on the wood flooring and suction power is relative to the motor horsepower so don't expect miracles.  Ease of use makes for more frequent cleaning being less of a chore, so cleaner floor results which was the objective of buying it.",
Aimeehelman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it !!!,the United States,27-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant on buying a crosswave because of the price, this popped up on my suggested search for over half the price so I decided to try it out, thank god I did I am in love! With five kids and four dogs I do a lot of sweeping and moping - this saved me so much time! I highly recommend !",One
Moore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this little cleaning machine,the United States,30-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have tile and vinyl floors and have always vacuumed and steamed mopped them.  I thought that was getting my flours clean until I started using the Tineco.  I love how small it is, cordless and that it is so easy to take apart and clean after each use!  Would recommend to anyone.  We don‚Äôt wear our shoes in the house, but we do have a little Yorkie who tracks in grass.",
Angie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning hardwood floors,the United States,1-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This product is great for light cleaning. Nice if you want to quickly clean your floors. The only thing that I‚Äôve disliked about it is that it will smear dirty footprints on hardwood floors. I recently had someone walk on mine with muddy shoes. I swept up all of the little pieces of dried mud with my vacuum cleaner, and tried to mop with the Tineco twice (the brush was clean before use). It just smeared the dirt everywhere.",
Deb,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality,the United States,20-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôve had this product for about three weeks and feel like the vacuum is fine, but the mopping feature isn‚Äôt the best. It is leaving water marks and to go Back to clean up the water tracks left on the floor. I‚Äôm wondering if their newer product works better, but considering returning.",One
danesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Scratches the hardwood floors, leaving permanent lines",the United States,22-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Big disappointment. This product has a flaw that defeats the purpose. It destroys the floors while cleaning them. Otherwise it's a nice appliance, but who wants to see the floors being scratched while cleaning.Unfortunately I'm out of the return window, because for a while I was in denial, I tried to like it and used it few times.",
Kristine,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it,the United States,16-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,So far this works great. I like the spot clean the best. I use spot clean on my entire floor. Cleans up everything very well. I notice mine does leave streaks if I don't use spot clean mode. Other than that I like it alot. I can get my whole house done pretty fast but I like to take my time.,
Judi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best cleaner,the United States,24-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Why did I not know about this when grandkids were little!Now at 70 I knew I could no longer mop the floor myself.  With pandemic do not feel comfortable in hiring someone to come in...Then I heard of this.  Excellent it really does vacuum and wash floor at same time.  It even got up cat litter and cat food.I am in love and Highly recommend,
nataliya,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could be improved but good buy,the United States,5-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,The first one I got was damaged but the company was quick to replace it. On wood it leaves spots everywhere on tile and other it's fine. I do love so convenient it is and especially the fact that it cleans it self. Great for a busy mom.,One
Chris Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not as great as it,the United States,21-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to receive this machine and it definitely beats vacuuming then mopping but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt pick up enough water, I still end up dry mopping over the top because the floors are so wet.If you don‚Äôt have kids running in behind you cleaning, this machine is awesome as long as youlisten and watch for the dirty water tank!",
Rena A. Legaspi,5.0 out of 5 stars,MUST. Especially for MOTHERS!!,the United States,4-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Love love love this vacuum/mop. It‚Äôs perfect for picking up liquid spills, food, hair, dust, just about anything and everything! Although it may be a little pricey, i highly recommend over other vacuum/mops because this one does not need disposable pads nor does it leak or over spray. I love that it self cleans and is super easy to clean out. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR MOTHERS!!!",
Charlene K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,the United States,11-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We have used this vacuum three times now. I absolutely love it! It cleans up wet and dry messes so easily. We had recently moved and have a large area of the house that is covered in hard wood floors. It took sooooo long to sweep and then mop the floor. This cuts the time in two and is not as strenuous. We can still see some spots that may need a firmer brushing after using the mop, so still need to do a formal mop every once and a while, but this is good for every day/weekly cleaning!",
Analy Gallegos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed!!,the United States,25-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I ordered my vacuum 2 days ago and received it this afternoon. Let me just say, this exceeded my expectations. I have 2 kids and a dog and my floors are swept almost everyday and mopped every 2 days or so, so they‚Äôre usually relatively clean. This vacuum sucked up derby that I could see! There was so much pet hair and dirt and overall just nastiness that the eye couldn‚Äôt see and the machine picked up. It is light, fast and powerful! I‚Äôm just amazed! Highly recommend to anyone who loves clean floors. Also I got a free solution bottle with my vacuum and it smells AMAZING!!",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,the United States,30-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like that it is cordless. That is is very light and very easy use. I have tile floors so can't comment on hardwood floors. I do shed and  i dogs so it does pick up our hair very well. I have little once in the e house, so this is perfect for picking up spill.",
party on,2.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,the United States,26-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,DO NOT PURCHASE! I bought this to clean and mop hardwood and kitchen floors. It holds a charge well and the vacuum does fair. The mop suction does not work most times and spreads dirty water. It is also a pain to take apart and clean. I missed the return date or I would definitely wanted my money back. If it sounds to good to be true it probably is.,
sraines,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not too happy,the United States,22-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I returned this after using 2 times. I had a cross wave and liked it‚Ä¶but this one seem more cheaply made. The suction is great and mopping is kind of sporadic. I decided I‚Äôd rather do the old fashioned way than to clean this thing after each use. I bet I used 10 gallons of water cleaning out all the wet dirt.,
Baili Buckner,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love this vacuum BUT...,the United States,12-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love this vacuum BUT this piece in the water tank came off and I have been trying to days to put it back on. Its so hard to get to and the vacuum won't work properly until that piece is back in place.  I can't find one to buy. Im thinking im going to have to buy a new vacuum bc of one piece. Not happy about that. I was so in love with he results of this vacuum but I've only had it a few months and its broken.,One
kathy levesque,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed after first use!,the United States,3-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,So I saw this on Tik Tok and thought I‚Äôd give it try since it is so much cheaper then other cordless wet/dry mops. I admit I saved all the packaging because I was skeptical that it would work that well at this price point.Today I used it for the first time on my kitchen floor. When I saw spots I used the spot feature and it cleaned them right up.  It was easy to use and clean. I haven‚Äôt quite figured out the self cleaning mode because it doesn‚Äôt shut off after 40seconds like it says in the instructions but I‚Äôm sure I just have delve a bit deeper to see if I missed something. If the more expensive ones do something different then this one then it‚Äôs beyond what I need so why pay that price.  Hopefully this will continue to be the case but I was sold after one time washing my kitchen floor and not having to drag a mop and bucket around.,One
Gloriana Apuy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Gets the job done,the United States,6-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like this product. I was unsure to buy it but it really gets the job done. It is not too loud so that is good.  The suction power is good. It is lightweight, so the suction is fair for its size. At times it may drip a little but not a big deal.  The only thing I don't like is the battery running time, it could last like 30 min but it has to be charged for almost 4 hrs. I live in a small apartment and the battery time is plenty enough to clean the whole apartment, so I guess that is not a biggie for me. Overall, I would recommend it.",
Evey Lesoing,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little cleaner but powerful.,the United States,9-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôd been looking for something like this for awhile.  It was only after visiting with my daughter‚Äôs cleaning lady and her high recommendation of this brand, that I decided to try for myself. It‚Äôs light weight, easy to handle and boy if you think your floor is actually pretty clean you might be in for a surprise.  The end was dirty, dirty water.",
April,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love!!,the United States,26-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this little machine! I was between the Bissell Crosswave and this so after reading many reviews and determining the price/quality seemed better.. I am so glad I made this choice!  So easy to clean all of my hardwoods floors. I took away a star because it‚Äôs not the best at edges (and with animals - the edges NEED attention) I am trying to find a cleaner that will also shine my hardwoods floors with this machine, too.",
Jmmommaoffive,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy and lightweight and does the job.,the United States,3-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Pros-very convenient and I love that it is cordless. Love that it‚Äôs self cleaning with some assistance from you. But easy to clean. Battery lasts about 45 minutes to an hour. And super light weight.  And I love the way my floors feel after. Cons-I do feel like the suction is a bit lacking and takes a bit to dry because of that.,
Andrea,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for huskies,the United States,24-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is definitely not for people with huskies ü§£ It kept getting clogged and was annoying to clean after using (the instructions tell you to take all these parts off to wash and fully dry them before reassembling). It did well on our flat flooring, but it struggled with the grooves on our textured laminate planks. Overall it was not for us and was returned.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for in between scrubbing on hands and knees,the United States,21-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Love! The vacuum feature is much stronger than anticipated. I am using it on my luxury vinyl plank flooring and it does a wonderful job. The floor does not get super wet, but with the spot clean function it can get hard messes up quickly. I have cleaned the machine per the directions after each use and the dirty water is absolutely disgusting, so I know it‚Äôs working! Super happy, pull the plug and buy it!",One
Bethann,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Machine for the price,the United States,17-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really like this little guy!I love the details like the the tray for it to rest on when not in use so you don't get your floor dirty underneath.  Also love the ease of cleaning it.I wish it was a bit re heavy duty for my uses, but for the price and being cordless, I am still impressed.  the only things that would make me give it a 5 star rating is if it came with a heavy duty scrubbing brush head along with the soft roller and if the suction was a bit stronger.Overall I am pleased with it's performance and feel that it is a fantastic machine for the  price.",One
SuzieQSolarama,4.0 out of 5 stars,Made well but doesn‚Äôt get deep clean,the United States,1-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The product is well made, actually surprised me with the quality. The only problem is that it does not clean well without using the spot button. I have LVT flooring and it missed many spots. When using the spot option constantly it works very well but it is difficult to keep holding the button down. The cleaner provided goes a very long way and smells fresh.",
Mindy Woodruff,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.,the United States,14-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I just got this mop today. I needed something to use daily and for quick messes. This mop is super lightweight and was easy to set up. I have 2 Great Danes, 2 cats, and 2 kids. And I HATE dirty floors. So I‚Äôm usually pretty skeptical about new items working up to my ridiculous standards. As luck would have it, this mop is pretty great. Much quieter then my last Hoover (ancient). Got all the paw prints, flour from baking with my daughter, and pet hair. With its ease of use, charging station right in the corner of my kitchen, I think this may be my new favorite cleaning product. Since it is day one, I‚Äôll update again in a month so see if there are any changes!",
Kaitie Fletcher,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not thrilled with it,the United States,16-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Honestly not thrilled. It gets up some dirt but I‚Äôve noticed dirt flies around it too. The washing component is terrible. You have to go over the spot like 10 times in order for it to some what come out. It also leaves dirty water all over the floor the second you turn it off. Picks up some dirt, kind of cleans the floor. So I guess it somewhat did it‚Äôs job. Not worth the money though. Plus side is it‚Äôs very quiet",
D. Evans,5.0 out of 5 stars,Update on my review,the United States,17-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,UPDATE  customer service contacted me & we resolved the problem. they were very helpfull & kept in touch with me for a couple of weeks until the problem was resolved.

Kristen Cunningham,1.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs terrible,the United States,25-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really really wanted to like this product, but it sucks. I spilled some dirt from potting plants, tried both dry and wet functions, all it did was push it around and make it messier. Does not even pick up fluff from my dog‚Äôs toys. Would NOT recommend.

Jgallant151,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, quiet, easy to use.",the United States,16-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This cleaner has cut my cleaning down to a fraction of the time I spent before I had it. It‚Äôs simple to use, easy to clean, and it really gives my tiles and hardwoods a nice polished look. The battery runs long enough to finish my whole house which is 3 bedrooms, dining room, living room, kitchen and two bathrooms. It‚Äôs quiet and easy to maneuver. The price is right because I saved about $100 by buying this over the bissell.",

nicholas farmer,4.0 out of 5 stars,All in all pretty good,the United States,22-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,All in all it‚Äôs a good product. Definitely not good for tile or stone floorings but does good for quick pick ups on vinyl or hardwood. It also vacuums short carpet. The mopping abilities isn‚Äôt the best. It‚Äôs good for just made messes but isn‚Äôt super great for anything that been stuck to the floor. It‚Äôs good for a quick mop but not a ‚Äúclean floors for guest coming over‚Äù mop. It is super easy to clean. The mopping solution doesn‚Äôt really smell like anything while you‚Äôre cleaning but you can add other solutions to it.,
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,the United States,8-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I used this for my laminate flooring through my living room and kitchen.  Either suction wasn't good enough or the front or the vacuum is too low because this machine couldn't pick up a Cheerio.  Seemed to do fine with cracker crumbs and dust/dirt but for a parent who'd also like a stray piece of cereal or dried chunk of play dough sucked up at the same time, no luck.  Sending back for a beefier version of this.  This brand overall has gotten good reviews but this one is definitely not powerful enough for what I want.",One
Joseph,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed.,the United States,17-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This little device is a great idea but it needs further development. It stops up easily. It leaks water. The motor isn‚Äôt powerful enough. It needs stronger suction. It also needs a bigger inlet for the dirt. It‚Äôs a good idea but it just isn‚Äôt ready yet.,
P. Dillon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great on tile floor!,the United States,5-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have porcelain tiled floors in my home. The tiles look like wood with ridges and I can‚Äôt get the floor clean with a steam mop. This tool does the trick. It‚Äôs amazing how much dirt the mop picks up.  Having a cordless mop makes it so content too.  Highly recommend!.,
Greta Hsu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight and easy to use,the United States,11-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This ifloor is light and easy to use. I use it about once a week and sometimes used it just as an vaccume. Self ceaning is a bit tricky and might not work too well if your house has many hair or pet fur stuff. After each use, I always take them apart to clean thoroughly instead of just relying on self clean. So far it's been pretty good.",
Wayne B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always ready to Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll,the United States,20-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,We have two cats three dogs this machine was a gods send.

I really did.,the United States,25-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really really really wanted to like this product and tried it several times before deciding to return.

Jena D Skara,1.0 out of 5 stars,Super disappointed,the United States,1-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I heard amazing things about this vacuum. But after using it for a couple weeks, I do not like it at all. My whole house has wood floors. It doesn‚Äôt get the stuff right up against baseboards or furniture so I have to get another vacuum with a hose attachment and get all the sides and corners. It spits tons of stuff back out, even though I clean it and de hair it after each use. It takes twice as long to vacuum because of it and never gets all the dirt. Having two kids, I am constantly vacuuming. So disappointed.",
Sara Marhefka,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Keep looking, not the machine for the job.",the United States,10-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was beyond excited to receive this vacuum, until it was time to use it. The first three or four used I was impressed and relieved it was able to pick up all of the pet hair on my hardwood floors. However, even with maintenance and caring for the vacuum, it‚Äôs slowly become a floor decoration in the corner of my kitchen. I have a few small area rugs in my home and thought this was going to be great but it spits out everything it sucks and the wet option doesn‚Äôt really pick up that easily without a lot of scrubbing or pre rinsing. I wish I could return it but it‚Äôs past the return date now so I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll be doing with it now.",

Kids and dogs in and out with kids who seem to always forget to take their shoes off. It‚Äôs a never ending cycle of vacuuming and mopping. I have used the robotics to help me keep up. Then, a friend of mine told me about this little vacuum. I used it for the first time and it was amazing. I have a combination of hardwood and tile throughout and it worked amazing on both. Cleaned up the sticky spots where the kids has spilled. Cleaned up the mess under the high chair too with its spot feature. All In a fraction of the time it would have taken me to sweep and mop. Don‚Äôt overthink it. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!",
Rebecca Espino,2.0 out of 5 stars,The quality for the price feels cheap,the United States,8-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this vacuum for my mom, who is 71.I needed something light and efficient for her as she's not able to lift any heavy items anymore.She has flooring throughout the house, and has two dogs.She's already having issues with the vacuum, it stopped picking up the debri off the floor, she went to clean out the tank, and one of the rubber seals broke off when she was taking it apart.I paid around 160 for this vacuum, and it feels like I bought a 40 dollar vacuum, I'm not impressed thius far with my purchase.",

It worked decent at first, but didn't clean as well as I had hoped. Then stopped sucking anything at all. No blockage. I've only used for light cleaning on tile floors. The roller still spun so it was just throwing everything around...including dirty water. I definitely don't recommend. Was so hopeful for this product. (Also, I did follow everything according to the instructions.)",
Amy R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't clean ANYTHING,the United States,30-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was very excited to get this vacuum after all the great reviews. However, once it got, the cleaning liquid wouldn't come out, the brush barely touched the floor and it kept dying on me even after I fully charged it first before using it just as the instructions said.The vacuum barely rotates as well so it was also very hard to maneuver it while trying to clean. It also barely touches the edges where the floor meets the wall, so you will need to go back and clean either with a regular mop.Do not recommend.",
karensway,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ease of use,the United States,6-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love this thing. I have been cleaning my floors way more often since I made this purchase. SO much more pleasant than old fashioned sweeping and mopping, this mop/vac is light weight and keeps my floors looking great. I use it on my area rugs too, only squeezing the water trigger if there is a spot on the rugs. The ease and convenience of this Tineco vac has made me want to clean my floors way more frequently than I did prior to finding this. I used to dread and put off sweeping and mopping, but actually kind of enjoy it now thanks to this little gem!",
Schultz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Love hate relationship,the United States,18-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I wanna love it and I love things about it just having a few issues that make me question the hefty price tag. The tank is small and on the plus side does pick up lots of dirty water but it leaks a little and slides all over the floor when using. Wish the wheels had some grip to them. So it's a disappointing love. Trying to fix the leak and see if I keep using it I can get use to the motion and make it work.,One

Marina,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not clean; ok for dusting the floor.,the United States,22-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Too disappointed. Weak suction. Definitely NOT for deep cleaning. The brush barely touches the floor. This is mostly appropriate for dusting the floors, not for cleaning. Left wheel marks all of the floor. I just hope it‚Äôs not a permanent scratch. Left strikes when it dried out. Feels like my dirty floor now has added dirty strikes from chemicals used in the ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù solution; surface looks more cloudy, with many-many strikes for the 4 wheels at the bottom of the mop. On top of that, it will not fit under the couch, as the handle cannot lay flat to the ground.",

Kelsey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,the United States,22-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have a German shepherd who sheds a lot. I use the Tineco every other day and I do have to stop and clean it out pretty often so it will continue to have suction power and not leave a lot of water on the floor. But overall I am very happy with it! It makes cleaning messes here and there much easier and cuts my time with sweeping and mopping.,One
Noah & Sierra Jones,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,30-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I am not impressed with this. I used to have the basic crosswave. Everybody raved about how much better the tineco was. We just put new flooring in our living room so I bought it. I‚Äôve used it a few times and the tanks being so small is a bummer. I‚Äôve had to empty it 5 times just for my living room. It‚Äôs not a big room. It didn‚Äôt pick up as well as I had hoped either. Maybe it‚Äôs just my machine specifically. But as of right now, I feel the crosswave worked better. I really do want to love this machine üò´",
Tanika ,4.0 out of 5 stars,It does the job,the United States,17-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,We have hardwood floors throughout our whole apartment and this is a lifesaver because I have a 2-year-old who spills a lot of stuff. It works as shown it's easy to clean The only thing is you kind of have to go slow it's not as powerful as the bigger ones. But if for sure cleans the floor. The Little wheels on the front on by the brush fell off I contacted the company and they sent me some replacements,
George Ash Maria,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. A must if you have little kids,the United States,21-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is perfect. I use it to clean up the floor after my kids eat... i use it to suck up water after they play in the bath tub and i use it for all the liquid spills. For the price this is exactly what i needed. I didnt want to spend double on the crosswave when i can but a similar product thats just as great.,
a.e.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,the United States,8-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was really looking forward to using this! It is mediocre at best. It‚Äôs really good at pushing dog hair around!

Sarah Vargas,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Vacuums fine, mops bad",the United States,19-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I liked the suction power but I ultimately returned it because it‚Äôs mopping feature was garbage. I had to go over the same spot at least 10 times to get that spot wet and then there were other times that pressing the button didn‚Äôt release water at all. The battery holds up pretty well and it‚Äôs easy to empty and clean out after use. It vacuums well, but if I‚Äôm going to spend money on a combo, I need both primary functions to work well.",
Meg K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for toddler parents,the United States,5-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We use this almost everyday.

Jessica,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had high hopes for this!,the United States,22-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get the TIneco in the mail, it was a Christmas present to myself. Unfortunately, the Tineco had a very low suction power for my household. With two dogs and a 5 year old, the Tineco wouldn't suck up and clean floors that were already used with vac. It would leave a puddle on my floor and not suck it up. Sometimes it would not spit out enough water to make the floors look clean. I would recommend saving your money for something more powerful and consistent!",

All it does is roll dirt around on your floor there‚Äôs two tiny wheels on the bottom not even 1 month of using the wheels have come off and tineco won‚Äôt return it of courseThis is so gross to clean not near as easy as the crosswave plus it sounds like your scratching your floor it‚Äôs the cheapest model for a reason def got with the crosswave for sure,
Shawn Myers,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,the United States,8-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Wish I was able to return this. The unit is NOT pet friendly what so ever, constantly clogs every couple minutes and you have to manually clean out the screen. Mind you, we vacuum our floors every other day and only have one dog. When wanting to do a cleaning using this cleaner, it constantly just clogs and takes longer to do our floors than just using a standard mop.Along with this, it leaves streaks all over when cleaning unlike how it says in the advertisements. Yes, we follow the cleaning instructions, yes we let the components dry after use, and yes I read the manual.",

Effie Gregory,1.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review !!!,the United States,18-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this product about two months ago. To actually vacuum your hardwood floors it‚Äôs a big help but as far as cleaning them it gets zero stars, I really wish I would of choosen the bissell and spent a extra 100 dollars because this is not worth it suction has worn down and yes I get all avenues clean after each use you will need to refill at least twice to mop a bedroom floor and it DOES NOT pick up all the spots and if you use the spot cleaner be ready to refill the solutions in 3 seconds. Rip off waste of money run and buy the bissell because I fully regret NOT getting one vs this one",

Two days after I got it my 2 year old decided to take her whole bowl of cereal with milk and throw it in the trash. I used the Tineco to clean up the milk and cereal that she spilled and it cleaned it up off the hard wood without hesitation! I‚Äôm so glad I bought it!",One
Holbroc,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,27-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I do not love this. I still have to sweep with a broom.

Jessica Younger,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Impressed.,the United States,26-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've seen videos on Facebook claiming how amazing, and truly it's not all that great. It left dirty water streaks. Small puddles of nasty water in my grout that it didn't suction. It does not clean up mud or large spills. It dies quickly. Just a pure waste of money. Makes me sick. I've never spent this much on a cleaning product. I'm sick to my stomach about it. Save your money. Use it elsewhere. My floors are not clean.

Billy E Thompson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very small,the United States,31-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This little us just ok not great but ok.

Dana Cross,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad, but not mind blowing.",the United States,24-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Did good for basic cleaning after a meal with two small kids. It‚Äôs lame you need to clean it up after each use, and they recommend running self-cleaning after each use which needs 1/3 of the tank full. Also, the top tank is really easy to get off, so my 2 y/o looooves to push the button and carry around the small tank.After having for 2 weeks of use, my 5 y/o dropped about half a bowl of somewhat soggy cereal, and it had a challenging time picking it all up. I‚Äôd say 1/3 the cereal, i had to pick up by hand because the vacuum didnt get it. Overall not bad, but also not amazing.",

It saves me from dragging out the bucket and mop.  The old wet mop I owned laid down too much water on my hardwood floors.  The old steam unit I owned didn't lay down enough water!  This mop cleans the hardwood and doesn't leave too much residue on it like other products do.  The floors dry quickly  It is a pleasure to use.  I have a dog and a cat and it works wonders with removing paw prints.  It doesn't work quite as well on my porcelain tile but still much better than the other products I have used.  Worth the money.  A bottle of solution came with the unit, so no need to order extra with your initial purchase.",

Suction power is horrible. Can‚Äôt even pick up a Cheerio. Going back to Amazon tomorrow. I‚Äôve concluded that there is not yet a cordless vacmop on the market that will clean a floor as well as a regular mop. Oh well. Don‚Äôt waste your money just get a cordless vacuum and spray mop.,
Tammy,5.0 out of 5 stars,It does get your floors clean.,the United States,31-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Good suction! Its great for liquid spills. Leaves the floor damp, but not wet.  It's  helpful when a wet Swiffer isn't nearly enough.  It has a self-cleaning function to get the roller brush clean and it works. There's also a brush to help clean it.  However, you still have to  dump out chunky nasty water and clean the filter, where to do that could be a problem.",

S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could be better for dry use,the United States,12-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Seems to be okay for regular crumb pickup, really dislike the singular dirty container (so all dry and wet go into one small holder).

Elizabeth S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh! Not worth the money.,the United States,19-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Not worth the money. The mop feature leaves streaks and residue. It vacuums great on bare floors and low pile carpet. Not meant for carpet. I didn't find it helpful for washing rugs. Cleaning was a chore all by itself. I ended up getting a Shark Apex duo and just using a good old fashion cedar mop and bucket.,
Jessica,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hardwoods!,the United States,18-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really like this multifunction vacuum.

Maureen P.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,the United States,24-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It would leave streaks,  not completely dry the floors,  I can wipe the portion I cleaned with a paper towel and it would be dirty,  leaves dirty water on the floor when you turn it off,  and the worst part - the spinning no stinks.

I called Tineco at first they said they would ship me a new one. Then after some time passed they asked me to send back mine first. So I did that and it took three months to get my new one sent back. I have a new one and it is so gross. Whenever I use it my whole house stinks. Cleaning out the nasty container is so gross too. It sort of cleans but it‚Äôs not worth the hassle of having to set it up and clean it each time.,

I sprayed some foam carpet cleaner on the stains before I started and used the ‚Äúspot clean‚Äù button so the roller would move twice as fast and it‚Äôs literally the best this carpet has ever looked. It‚Äôs completely worth the money!,

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was anticipating.,the United States,18-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Maybe my expectations were too high.. but I only have one small toddler in the house (no pets) and the kiddo is pretty timid/laid back. Everything smelled great when I was finished, yeah, but the tank was soooo small. I had to refill so many times and I have a pretty small apt (2 bedroom). The floor was wet, yes, but you could still see the lightest of prior smudges after the floor dried. It wasn‚Äôt a REAL clean to me. It was a little better on spot mode.. but still not nearly as strong as I‚Äôd prefer. I hate to say it but I may try to hop on the Crosswave train!",

Mark W. Clifton,1.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend Avoiding this Product,the United States,22-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Unit failed after less than 1 year of use.  Tineco customer service has been lackluster to resolve the issue.  It has been over 2 months since the unit failed and Tineco has not honored its 1 year warranty.  I sent the unit back to them for a replacement and it has still yet to arrive.  Had to purchase another Wet-Dry vacuum (different manufacturer); how does any company think you can go over 2 months without cleaning your floors.Biggest Draw-Back:  Cannot replace the battery.  Once it fails, the vacuum is useless with no way to repair/replace the battery.",

Plus, it was so much floor to clean.I have to say the battery life on this has been great and is even better the more I use it. I think I‚Äôm more comfortable with it too. It is absolutely amazing to me how dirty the water gets. It‚Äôs both disturbing and satisfying at the same time. I use it about three times a week. My favorite is when something spills in the kitchen or my little one splashes to much in the bathroom- this handles it amazing and fast!!",

The only ‚Äúcon‚Äù I could think of would possibly be the spinning roll of the mop needs to be cleaned often and completely dry before next use or else it‚Äôll start to stink.

Other than that, it works like a dream",
Candice Elkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine!,the United States,5-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I purchased one of these for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  After my floor steamer broke my husband purchased this Tineco for me.  It's easy to use, convenient for quick cleanup or entire floor cleaning.  We have house dogs so I use this almost every day.  It's so convenient for keeping my floor nice and clean.  It runs about 30 minutes on a full charge.  Great purchase!",
Taylor Jones,2.0 out of 5 stars,i do not recommend,the United States,7-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,liked the packaging and the look and lightweight feel of the vacuum while usingdisliked that it didn‚Äôt seem to work very well. the ‚Äúwet mop‚Äù feature didn‚Äôt work i would hold the button down for long periods of time hoping the cleaning solution and water mix would cover the floor so i could clean but the water came out in tiny streaks and then stopped coming out. so much for a vacuum that doesn‚Äôt really perform very well. i admit i listening to a lot of social media ads when purchasing i should‚Äôve read more reviews on it. i plan on returning if possible. i don‚Äôt recommend,
melissa furtado,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the $$$,the United States,8-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this product!I was so excited to get it!!But it was too soon very disappointing on many levels.The suck is weak.When it‚Äôs full it spits everything back.It does not hold a charge long.It fills up quick.And cleaning it out after each wash is more work then what it‚Äôs worth.All that said, after just a month,  I can‚Äôt even use it anymore.After washing properly  each use and even soaking the mopping mechanism in bleach, the machine has a very bad odor.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Portable and easy to use.,the United States,21-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Lightweight and easy to use. Battery life is a problem. I have $1500 square feet and had to do it in two sessions. I was using the scrub function. I emptied the tank every 200-300. It‚Äôs a trade off between weight and portability. I have two dogs and cats that ahead a lot. When I use a mop there is always hair left behind on the floor. This picked up everything no problem. Nothing left behind.,
Cheyenne,1.0 out of 5 stars,not worth it,the United States,31-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"bought it mainly for a hardwood vacuum part, mop included is a bonus! it does suck some of the dirt, but will shoot it all back out within a few seconds. pretty much is just spreading it around.i don‚Äôt understand. not worth the price at all.",
Kelly,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy something else.,the United States,9-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Good for a quick clean but doesn't get close enough to the baseboards so you will have to get the edges with your broom and mop. It dies too quickly and the reserve tank isn't big and when it fills up it leaks all over the floor. In addition all the dirty water and debris sits in the tank together so you can't really dump it down the toilet unless you want to clog your pipes,
Carmen Zeno,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great,the United States,6-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This Tineco iFLOOR Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop is quite amazing.  I have a Golden Retriever, so the sheading is also quite amazing.  For any wet/dry vacuum to work is extraordinary.  This is my second, beautiful Golden Retriever in my life.  I never thought they would come up with something like this.  Awesome!",
Ariel Sweeney,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed,the United States,27-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was extremely disappointed after trying to use this product twice. I used it for about 4 minutes each time, and after those 4 minutes the water stopped spraying. I checked to make sure there were no clogs, took it completely apart both times and washed everything out, but the issue didn't resolve itself. I am sending it back and getting a crosswave.",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this so far,the United States,18-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have to empty the bottom park after one small room and constantly refill ‚Ä¶ but it works great and picks up sand and dirt food and small items easy. Self cleaning feature is great!! I have to say it is worth the money my floors are clean. Some spots are a little difficult but I just spray prior and it‚Äôs still 100% easier then sleeping and mopping all the time,
TAE,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase! Parent approved!,the United States,27-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love this 2 in 1. I have a 2 year old and an all tile house so it is used almost on a daily basis. It‚Äôs easy to assemble, lightweight and easy to clean after each use. It can leave streaks on darker flooring or dark vinyl planks. I don‚Äôt have issues with streaking on my stone tiles. It works great in those rooms and quickly. It saves me time and the hassle of having to do sweep and then mop which is why I purchased it.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning made easy,the United States,2-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This vacuum is the best!  I used it on my marble floors and it made them shine. I didn‚Äôt use the cleaner it came with because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would mess up my floors but using it with just water and a dash of dish soap was perfect. Easy to use and easy to clean!,
mdl256,4.0 out of 5 stars,TikTok made me buy it!,the United States,23-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Like many TikTok made me buy it! I really wanted the Crosswave and this seemed like a cheaper alternative. It does a really good job on hardwood. It saves time by doing your sweeping and mopping at once. We have 5 boys so it definitely comes in handy!,
walbob63,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,3-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have 2 dogs and 2 cats. This is not able to keep up with the household. Constantly clogged, water tank is small, hair gets stuck in the wheels, back wheels stopped turning and left marks on my hardwood floors, cleaner does nothing to improve animal smells and the machine itself within 3 weeks smells like wet dog. Cleaned after each use, even tried cleaners to improve roller/machine smell with no luck. Waste of money. Takes less time to sweep and mop than to use this machine.",
Marisa Conrow,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't do it, save your money!!",the United States,14-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"DO NOT BUY!! The swivel part cracked and broke on my 2nd use. It just pushed dog hair and dust around my kitchen. Worked ""ok"" as the mop part, but doesn't vacuum well at all! Puts a lot of water on the floor, and vacuums very little up. I was not impressed in the slightest. Not worth the money!!!",
Rebecca,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best adult purchase!!!,the United States,27-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Literally the best thing ever! I use it 1-2 times a weeks and everytime it cleans my floors so good! It really pulls up all the dirt embedded in my floors. Best part is I can use it just as a vacuum to clean up crumbs or little messes from making dinner and such. the battery is pretty good but I live in a 800 sq ft apartment and I can get it all done with one battery life (plus I like to take my time.) Honestly the best purchase in my adult life so far!,
tlotter,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ehhh,the United States,16-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It was okay. I did not feel like I was getting a good clean floor even after passing over 3 times. When I dumped the water it was not as dirty as I expected for an area that is high traffic for dogs and kids. Ended up returning it.,
Alyssa Kachelhoffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great two in one machine!,the United States,20-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this cleaner because of the reviews vs. The bissell crosswave. I have only used it once but man did it meet expectations! At first I didnt think it was cleaning because the solution needed to saturate the roller I think. We have 3 dogs and it cleaned great with quick dry time.  Definitely would recommend to pet parents however, it does not suck up larger items like a vacuum.",
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly surprised,the United States,21-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this to wash my painted concrete floors in my garage.  We had puppies and I wanted something that would clean the floor.  I was using this on pretty heavy duty items.  I did have to clean it, but it pulled apart and went together very easily.  Very impressed with how long the charge lasted.  The only thing I was disappointed in, was that it didn't clean right to the edges. of the wall or trim.",
Maricruz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not like this one,the United States,14-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I had previously owned the tineco one s3 and I loved it but it broke and since I only use it to clean a very small kitchen and living room I thought I'd give this one a try but hated it from the minute I turned it on.It doesn't clean well. I wouldn't recommend it.,
Kyle Kobel,1.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum sucks don‚Äôt waste your money,the United States,25-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It sucks; battery doesn‚Äôt last long, the suction for hardwood floor it blows everything out of the back, and it‚Äôs honestly way smaller in person, returning this ASAP. Big disappointed and waste of money buying a better one",One
Chris B.,2.0 out of 5 stars,It does not pick up dog hair,the United States,15-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this machine, only to discover that it does not pick up the dog hair other than wadding it up and depositing it on other parts of the floor.  I didn't even try the mop, this was only dry vacuuming.  After seeing the wads of dry dog hair, I didn't even want to try and get wet dog hair.",One
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I thought it would be..,the United States,29-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Very cheaply made. It takes forever to clean this thing out really good so that it doesn‚Äôt start to stink. Battery battery usually last me a while, however I have to stop and refill the liquid quite a bit. It‚Äôs definitely not for anybody with pets because it is a pain in the rear to clean out all of the pet hair",One
la. b.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,12-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,One of the best purchases I've made on Amazon.  Recommended and saw the reviews for this TikTok and had to have since the cost was much better than the other brands I were viewing.  Works great on my vinyl plank laminate flooring.  And usually one filling of the container gets my entire house and I'm not easy on the cleaning solution.,
Nay-ology,3.0 out of 5 stars,OK but died 1 year and 2 months later,the United States,25-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Love this thing when I first bought it! Suctions great. Cleans both hard wood & carpets.  Transitions without any problems. Easy to clean. BUT....I purchased this in July 2019 and it has recently died.  So sad! Reached out to customer services with zero response.  Extremely sad about this.  I guess you get what you pay for.,
Megan Pilgrim,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,the United States,25-Jun-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I used this mop/vacuum the first day it arrived. I‚Äôm very impressed by how well it suctions since it is cordless! My floors were steam mopped about a week ago and this is the dirt that still came off my floors! To have a product that is cordless, lightweight, vacuums and mops all at the same time is a mother‚Äôs dream!! It was also VERY easy to take apart and clean! I would give 10 stars if I could!",
Mari,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than Floormate!!! Cleans well, easy to use.",the United States,14-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have used the Tineco cleaner only once since receiving it.

brandon demars,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,the United States,31-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Got this for the wife to make cleaning one less step. And she loves it. And uses it on any cleaning to the floors. Super easy to clean the machine. Would recomend over the bissel croswave. Worth the value,
Emily,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work less than 10 months later...,the United States,15-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This thing is a piece of crap. Like a glorified swiffer wet jet. Save yourself the time and aggravation and just buy the Bissell Crosswave. I bought this less than 10 months ago and it's trash.,
Jean Marie Voytyshyn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not great at all,the United States,22-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,The suction isn‚Äôt great.  I had to go over my vinyl flooring multiple times.  It doesn‚Äôt puck up close to the edge like most vacuums do.  I chased after a small clump of cat hair which my old vacuum would suck up immediately.The washing of floors wasn‚Äôt bad but you could do better with a swiffer mop.  Not worth the money.,
Kayleigh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sucks,the United States,13-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is the very first review I‚Äôve ever done. I had very high expectations for the tineco after hearing so many good things and reading good reviews I finally ordered it, I was originally going to buy the bissell. I‚Äôm not sure if I just got a defective one, but it SUCKS!!! The 20 some year old vacuum my boyfriends grandma let us borrow before I ordered this worked better, and I thought that one sucked! I have hardwood floors, I‚Äôll go over the same spot 5 times before it even picks anything up and it still leaves stuff behind. I‚Äôll be returning it.",
Ashley Dorr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!,the United States,17-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This little wet dry vacuum has made cleaning my floors so much easier! I have a messy 4 year old and I‚Äôm a working mom so it‚Äôs hard to find the time to sweep and mop. Now I can sweep and mop in the time it took me just to sweep. It‚Äôs super easy to use. I was a bit concerned about having to take it apart to clean it after use but it takes less than 5 minutes to do so. My floors are super clean after use. If you are expecting this vacuum to clean all the way to your baseboards you will be disappointed. It leaves approximately a 1 inch area that won‚Äôt be cleaned by the vacuum against the baseboards.,
MWells,4.0 out of 5 stars,Two in One Cleaning,the United States,24-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Pros:‚Ä¢Vacuum and mop at the same time!!‚Ä¢Spot Remover really gets those hard to clean messes‚Ä¢Charge lasts long enough to do the whole house‚Ä¢I know it is working because the water is FILTHY when I empty itCons:‚Ä¢Have to take apart and clean lots of pieces after each use‚Ä¢Sometimes have to go over a mess a few times to clean it‚Ä¢It will leave a small line of dirty water when I shut it off, sometimesOverall a great buy!

Mah,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have really tried to like this cleaner..but,the United States,5-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have really tried to like this cleaner!! but I just don't!! I keep using it thinking that I will like it better each time but..nope!  it vacuums and cleans the floor and makes mud puddles.  The floor is probably clean, at least the water is dirty, but I just feel like something is missing and that it really isn't clean.  I think I will go back to my steamer.",
Monica Czeschin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes cleaning almost fun,the United States,9-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This lil gadget is ‚Äúda bomb‚Äù it makes cleaning almost fun. I go from my hardwood floors to my tile floor with ease‚Ä¶‚Ä¶my only complaint is that it does not do edges well‚Ä¶..but for general everyday cleaning I love this thing.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent machine,the United States,25-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is a great litle machine. We have four of them. It will pick up liquid hair dirt just about anything. We have a dog kennel so we use it all of the time. Easy to clean the rollers and if it gets gloged very simple to un clog.The only down side is that it is small. We also have a hoover flor mate for doing large areas. If you are reading this Tineco ""MAKE a bigger version of this machine, keep the design it is excellent"". I highly recomend this product.",
recipe enthusiast in Florida,5.0 out of 5 stars,So Happy I purchased,the United States,10-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've read every review when it came to puchasing a new vacuum/ floor cleaner. Tineco had the best reviews. I have to add to those reviews. Love the cordless ability, the ease of filling and pushing the button to start. The swivel of the head makes it wonderful on getting in those hard to reach places. I went from a broom and mop bucket, to a wonderful Tineco iFloor!",
Bhalil ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!! Best cleaning product I‚Äôve bought yet!,the United States,26-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"For the price it works great at replacing having to vacuum and mop the floors separately! I use it a few times in a week thanks to having a dog that tracks in dirt and being a little OCD on having a clean house. Amazing what it pulls up even when the floors don‚Äôt look ‚Äúdirty‚Äù. I‚Äôve also used it to vacuum up low profile runners/area rugs. It has no issue! And for a 1,300sq ft home it works in one run no need to wait to recharge",
Brittany Roy,5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm happy,the United States,3-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I cleaned my whole house and was amazed on how much this product picked up. Floors felt wonderful after. However, I did have to stop multiple times to clean the dirty water and rolling brush but I do have two dogs‚Ä¶and two little boys!! Overall, I would recommend.",
Halley,3.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient BUT,the United States,10-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,At first I loved this but the more I use it the more annoyed I get. The tank is pretty small so only really good for smaller areas or you have to empty and clean it more. The hole to the dirty tank is small and gets clogged easily. Came with a brush to clean but it doesn't fit to well. Recently it has stopped dispensing the water out of no where... you have to clean the filter everytime or it smells God awful. And now after several months the brush bar stopped spinning. And you can't get close to the walls and cabinets as I'd like,
Tim W.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well for a few months.,the United States,9-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The machine worked excellently for approximately four months, then the sprayer stopped working.

Tricia Murdock,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't Scrub - Very Disappointed,the United States,28-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I expected to find a tool that I could use daily to spot clean my kitchen linoleum and hardwood floors. The spot scrub doesn't work - even if you run over the spot for 2-3 minutes or let the brushes stand on the spot for the same amount of time.  It must pick up some dirt here and there because the water is dirty when I clean it out. But it certainly doesn't do a great job or a thorough job. I wish I could get my money back.,
Devin,2.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôd rather mop,the United States,27-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Will it pick up a spill? Sure. Could you have broken out your mop and bucket faster? 100%. I mainly purchased this to clean up my dog‚Äôs accidents and just didn‚Äôt do the job.  Suction is almost nothing. It leaves more water on the floor than it picks up. Lots of residue left behind. I‚Äôd say you get what you pay for but this thing wasn‚Äôt even worth the $169 I paid. Maybe more like $50 value. I‚Äôve returned it and spent the money on the floor one S3 and am very happy with that purchase.,
Robert Edgerton,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure what all the hype is?,the United States,14-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I‚Äôm not really a fan I don‚Äôt like that you have to dump liquid plus debris outside or at least down your toilet after each use. It definitely can‚Äôt go down your kitchen drain. And do not forget to clean out the dirty tank bc it will smell horrible!I don‚Äôt want to clean out the brush etc every time I use it. Not sure what all the hype was.,
Alona Everson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love",the United States,14-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love it! Floors are much cleaner because you are always cleaning with clean water and dirty water is sucked up. Love that it's light and cordless. You won't be sorry you purchased this!!,
DMc,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and easy to use,the United States,21-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Even though the cleaner is smaller that I thought it would be I am very happy with how well it cleans.  The only issue that lingers with me is that I was sent an obviously returned item. It was not repacked well and the cleaning fluid had been opened and partially used. The clean water tank still contained fluid. But the roller seemed to be new, clean and dry and the dirty water cup was clean.",
CJM,1.0 out of 5 stars,Floor not as clean as I hoped.,the United States,5-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Worked ok the first few times.  I have to unclog often when using as a mop because dog hair gets stuck inside.  When I unclog it I also wash the roller/brush.  That way I am starting out all clean again.  The bottle brush only gets sum of the hair unclogged. It doesn't help on the head of the vacuum.After I a finished cleaning I can go back with a wet paper towel and wipe the cleaned area.  My paper towel is dirty.  This is not clean enough for me.,
Cactusflower,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not powerful enough, battery ran down fast, kicked dirt out of the back of it",the United States,26-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It pushed dirt out of the back of the vaccum when vacuuming.  And dirty water out of the back when mopping. Suction wasn't good enough, would have to go over and over. Very time consuming.  Then the battery would die in between doing the kitchen and living room and i have a small kitchen and living room.",
Linda Graham,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this floor cleaner. I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long.,the United States,28-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was amazed by this floor cleaner. It uses very little water and actually cleans the floor. I have dogs, not just any dog. Siberian huskies who shed and shed. This picks up all the hair and dirt. The hair does not wrap around the tube like it does on my vacuum. It also has a self cleaning mode.",
Katie1357a,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst purchase ever,the United States,16-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I did a lot of research before buying this product. I‚Äôve never been more disappointed with a purchase. Here are the reasons why:1) It‚Äôs way too expensive for the quality!2) the chamber for the soap/water is way too small and you have to keep filling up every few minutes.3) it leaves horrible streaks4)  it doesn‚Äôt do a good job cleaning at all!!!!!5) the battery doesn‚Äôt last long at all before you have to charge it again.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this daily, I love it!",the United States,14-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really like this vacuum! Not for deep cleaning per say, but for daily messes it‚Äôs great! I‚Äôve learned I like to use it dry then add water for spot cleaning. I didn‚Äôt like how the bristles got wet dog hair wrapped up in them. But that‚Äôs just personal preference. It worked great either way. I use it daily!! But clean it out after each use, and don‚Äôt let it set wet... it gets smelly.",
Bridget Selby,2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good and looks nice,the United States,10-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like the vacuum/mop but honestly buying a regular mop and broom will clean better, the roller on the bottom of mine isn‚Äôt the best and I don‚Äôt feel like mine releases enough water to clean anything.. but mines been parked used maybe 3 times I have all hardwood and 2 small rugs by the way, and some tile/ rock floor in the bathroom",
crumblebum,1.0 out of 5 stars,Literally stinks,the United States,26-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Even when I've followed all of the directions and unload and empty the collection bin and water reservoir and leave the roller brush to dry after every use, this thing has a mil#ew smell it pumps out whenever I turn it on.  The cleaning solution is scented and would cover it up but when I used plain water I could smell mildew. This does not seem hygienic or healthy to me.",
Samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do you think you‚Äôre house is  pretty clean? Think again.,the United States,22-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Ok. If you want to feel disgusted by how dirty your floors are, but this thing. I swept and mopped with my normal broom and swifter wet jet, and then used this and HOLY MOLY.

Jennifer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Returning,the United States,15-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Just doesn‚Äôt do the job for me. I‚Äôd rather old fashion mop. It takes forever to clean one room.

Cheryl  price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for The price,the United States,19-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,We have only used this a few times since receiving it but it does the job and is really easy to use!

Foster,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it.,the United States,2-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,So far im loving this vacum.  Its very lightweight which really helps with my tendonitis and carpal tunnel issues. I have tile floors and even tho i would like a rougher spinning brush it still beats a mop and bucket anyway.  I see this working really well on hardwood floors and its great on ceramic floor tiles.,
Jennifer,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's very quiet,the United States,4-May-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I like that it's easy to clean. I dislike the very short battery life,5
Sayers M. McAlpin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,19-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I used to use a steam mop. I decided to get this because it vacuums and mops are the same tome.

It picks up all the dog hair from my giant Akita/German Shepard mix.",
Chicana,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too much work,the United States,18-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Way too much work basically each time you use it you have to practically disassemble to clean many parts so your machine won‚Äôt be dirty or smell! Way too much work I regret buying it!,
Kayla,2.0 out of 5 stars,I think they are going under,the United States,21-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I thought this was going to be a great product because first it was and then honestly it ended up being a disaster if you look this should have never had a crack like this and I can't buy parts for it at all I've tried I will say though that Amazon took care of me,

I love how well it cleans my floors I can really see a huge difference, but my house is pretty large & the water container gets full every like 3 minutes. & it dies SOOOOO fast. Does not last long at all! So I‚Äôd put back on charger between breaks & refilling/emptying the water or you‚Äôll never finish a single room.

karen mcdonald,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for light cleaning.  Not for heavy duty cleaning.,the United States,20-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Distributes a light spray & suctions water really well. Scrubber is soft & provides very little scrub power.  Product is very lightweight.  I use it on a tile floor; would probably work better on wood.,

While this product isn‚Äôt horrible, I wish I would have gone with another one. This product leaves streaks all over my floor and doesn‚Äôt deep clean like I thought it would. It‚Äôs honestly a tiny step up from a swiffer.",One
heather,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just a vacuum for hard floors,the United States,23-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is only for hard wood floors! It doesn't do anything for carpet or rugs. You have to go over your floors numerous times to get it clean. The solution doesn't have a strong smell to make your house smell good after cleaning. It's good for a quick vacuum. It sucks to clean because hair gets wet inside and you have to take everything apart and wipe it out. Grossü§Æ,
Ginger,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't want to clean after cleaning!,the United States,27-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Good for what it does, but they don't tell you you have to take it apart after every use. Take out the roller, clean the dirty tank, clean the roller, which is partly self cleaning. Then clean the brush roll area, the tray, etc. 20 min of cleaning after cleaning floors. Doesn't reach the edge of the floors close to the wall. About 2 inches away from it.",
Megan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good for small easy cleaning.,the United States,17-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I use for my living room floor which stay clean for the most part besides dog hair and some paw prints from the dog coming in and out. Does not work good for dried food or drinks that have spilt or anything like that unless still wet and clean it up right away. Not good for deep cleaning or tough, gritty messes. When I do empty my tank it always is very dirty and lots of hair so is working decent. Have to charge after every use does die fast.",
Teresa McCarthy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good everyday cleaner,the United States,6-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I think it‚Äôs great for just touch up it doesn‚Äôt put a lot of water down it doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of water but there‚Äôs not enough for the scrubby brushes on the roller to really get tough spots up, I would keep it but it‚Äôs not was looking for. I will say it‚Äôs easy to clean all the parts and put it back together after years and that‚Äôs a plus",
Jordan Gyoker,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my tineco,the United States,6-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"yall this THE product. For my small house with four animals, I was constantly vacuuming and mopping. I felt like my house was never truly clean. This product helps save me time and I know its clean. The only issue I have is keeping it clean, but thats another story.",
Luz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,22-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Really love this Mop/vacuum makes it easier to clean up. Would‚Äôve gave it 5 stars but I really don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt hold up a lot of water and have to constantly empty out.

CLee,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't clean well and has a battery problem,the United States,4-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Had it about 1-1/2 years and the battery is broken for a second time.  Won't take a charge at all.  Doesn't do a great job cleaning.  And make sure you take it apart and clean it, especially the roller with soapy water, and then leave it out to dry or it will get a horrible moldy smell.",
Kurt Hilger,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall a good unit.,the United States,15-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Pro - This unit performed well on our lightly soiled hardwood and marmoleum floors. Have not had the opportunity to try it on heavily soiled floors. It cleaned about 100 ft2 ( 10‚Äô x 10‚Äô)before the tank had to be refilled.Con - the wheels left streak marks on the floor that had to be buffed off with a rag.,
CalamusDraco,4.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely loving it!,the United States,15-Jun-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The ONLY thing I dislike is when you have animals (the whole reason I chose this type) is how frequently you need to dump canister. There is plenty of room to handle more, but the filter gets clogged up to easy. I have a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house & it will run thru all rooms on 1 charge. So convenient to use & when every room is hardwood floors this is a God sent. Quick & easy to use.",
Lucy S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but could be better,the United States,8-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I thought I would love this vacuum but unfortunately I don't it's great for vacuuming floors but the mopping part is not that good you also have to make sure you take out any leftover water after each use and dry the roller which I had laying out for 2 days and it wouldn't fully dry. The charge also does not last long on it,
D. D. Fink,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use.  Designed with features I really like,the United States,1-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I needed this to clean my floors as I can't get up and down any more.

none,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth buying.,the United States,9-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"In order to get any kind of cleaning to happen, I had to go so slow it would have taken me all day to clean my floors. My old trusty wonder mop still does a better job and in much less time.",
susan Colon,2.0 out of 5 stars,You will never get parts!,the United States,2-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The product works well and made my life easier.  The drive belt has gone bad, so I was not so disappointed, just buy a new one and put it in. Good luck trying to find parts. Called their number for customer service and I just get a loop.

Samantha Gonzalez,2.0 out of 5 stars,Let down,the United States,28-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Honestly, for the price I paid I expected a lot more. Especially with all the fuss.

Sure wish I had waited to try the other now, because this was a bit disappointing.",One
Gabriella Gomez,2.0 out of 5 stars,Breaks easily with weekly use,the United States,19-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I‚Äôve had this for about two months now and I feel like it does a decent job cleaning but I also feel like I‚Äôm constantly trouble shooting this device. Every other time I go to use it, I have to take it apart and figure out why the water isn‚Äôt dispensing or what part ‚Äúpopped off‚Äù. recently it‚Äôs the water control thing at the clean water dispenser. I‚Äôve tried everything to clip it back on but nothing. So now, I have a useless device that either spews too much water or none at all. I feel like I wasted my money.",
Lynne P Straw,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is great for daily cleaning!,the United States,30-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love the ease of using this vacuum.

Alley,1.0 out of 5 stars,highly disappointed,the United States,24-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This vacuum came highly recommended and I am highly disappointed.  It simply doesn't work and unfortunately I got rid of the box as soon as I opened it so returning isn't an option.,
Neil,4.0 out of 5 stars,Something is not right!!!!,the United States,3-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This machine has been great on my floors. However I have been looking for replacement brushes, Amazon doesn't seem to carry them anymore.  As I was looking through other floor cleaners I found this machine listed twice one for the $169 that I got it for and another for $299. What is going on here.  I also looked at the Tineco store and website, it seems either they cant keep up with demand or they are turning into a fly by night company.",
Hailey Guthrie ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I expected,the United States,28-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This works great! I use it daily. I even use it as a quick vacuum on our small area rug. It wouldn‚Äôt work for a full room of carpet, but it does for the small rug that I use it on. It gets our hardwood floors super clean",
Kassy wilder,3.0 out of 5 stars,Leaks... :(,the United States,27-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"At first it worked ok.... After using it for the third time, it leaks so much from underneath. I love the cordless, the battery last though. But after seeing the water leaked out I started emptying the dirty water more often, still didnt fix the leaking from underneath. Not sure if im just stuck with it or what.",
Michael D. Moss,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smelly,the United States,18-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Bought this item December 2020. It was ok for a bit. After a few uses it began to smell no matter what. Cleaned the machine exactly as the instructions said. Even turned to many YouTube videos. No matter what it always smelled. Would constantly spit out dirty water too. Again did everything the manufacturers said to do.,
Jenn,3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs eh okay,the United States,2-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs a great product and cleans well however the battery takes forever to charge and the battery life is not long. The first floor of my house is tiny and I am only able to get the living room and kitchen done then it needs to be recharged. The bedroom, bathroom and laundry room will have to wait until the following day. It also seems like only half of the roll is dispensing water and solution so I have to go back over the area twice. I will continue to use it and see if it gets better",

This is not that product. This will be going back.",One
Kadie Riney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps out so much !,the United States,14-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This little guy is pretty dang cool! It sucks up everything really well as being quite.

Jeff Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans great and no cord!!!,the United States,18-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Just bought this a few weeks ago and it is working great so far.

Carolina,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well once..,the United States,20-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I don‚Äôt normally leave large comment reviews but I‚Äôm so unsatisfied with this item I feel like I have to warn people. It worked really well the first time we used it (lol) but then after that it stopped just about anything on the floor, especially hair! Some areas would be dirtier than before the vacuum so I feel like it started to just move the pieces around. I wished I had used it enough in the beginning to return it before the date on that closed to be honest.",
You Jun Wang,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not working well,the United States,13-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It‚Äôs not what I expected . Not working as the Website show. All hair stuck between. It‚Äôs so hard to clean. On the floor can‚Äôt pick up the cereal. Washing the machine is more work than mop the floor by myself.,
N Clark,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not too bad,the United States,6-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Not too bad for first use. Could use a little more suction power and not so great at getting the edges, but with a dog, three cats, and kids (and the fact that I haven‚Äôt swept or mopped in a bit), it did pretty well. Will update once I‚Äôve used a few more times. Hoping suction power will increase more on a full charge.",
Amy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,the United States,30-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was very skeptical about this product because of the amount of dog hair I have daily! But this thing is magical. I‚Äôve used it quite a few times now and it never fails me! It‚Äôs not super quiet but I can use it while my baby sleeps so it‚Äôs decently quiet! It‚Äôs super easy to clean!,
Tara,1.0 out of 5 stars,Better on hard wood than tile.,the United States,17-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I don‚Äôt usually do negative reviews, but I‚Äôm disappointed. Much much smaller than expected and doesn‚Äôt self clean. Doesn‚Äôt work like videos show. I have to swipe extremely slow and several times to get one spot even cleaned. I could clean faster and better with a clorox wipe.",
Steve&Michele,5.0 out of 5 stars,Timesaver,the United States,14-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love it! Vacuum and mop at the same time is great. We have laminate flooring and sand/dirt gets tracked in no matter how hard I try to stop it. This gets the dirt up. It‚Äôs very easy to take apart to empty and clean.,
Eric,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality floor cleaner,the United States,2-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Not pleased with this floor cleaner device, does not dispurse cleaning fluid evenly, fluid pickup ratio seems less than output, suction is poor, does not pickup fluid from grout lines well, battery does not last 15 minutes while doing 400sqft. tile floors. Requires recharge. I'll be sending this cleaner back.",
Norma Torres,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't recommend,the United States,18-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I'm not very impressed with this product I think the O-Cedar spin mop does a much much better job. This is good for maintenance but not for deep cleaning. I wasted my money on this,
Ashley Greer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,the United States,29-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,So far I love this product. Cleans extremely well. Has a self cleaning option that I love. Easy to use. I do recommend reading the book and learning all the features.,One
Moonlights96 ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Glorified mop, swifter works better.",the United States,24-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is almost pointless, go buy a swifter. I bought this fir the use of the vacuum on carpet and hardwood, only using the wet in hardwood. Either way it literally doesn‚Äôt pick up anything on either surface, wet or dry . Having to sweep the floor before spraying out kind of defeats the purpose.",
Mrs. Miller,1.0 out of 5 stars,Total Trash,the United States,14-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Dont buy this trash. It's a complete waste of time and money.

Pamela E Powrie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Everyday product for a clean home,the United States,10-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"For the price, this is a great option. I have used this on hardwood floor and a rug with great success pulling up dirt and dog hair. If you‚Äôre looking for something to clean the floors more thoroughly than a mop but not a deep clean, this is for you. I also really appreciate the easy clean up with a self cleaning mode and all parts being washable.",
Alex Moon,1.0 out of 5 stars,The vacuum failed exactly after 1 year.,the United States,18-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Dont recommend this product as after one year, while using the vacuum it all of sudden stopped. Tried recharging battery but doesn't work anymore. This only lasted 1 year.",
Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it! You won‚Äôt regret it!,the United States,12-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Excellent and efficient product. Great bang for your buck! It cleaned up after a very active family, toddler and 85-pound Labrador retriever. The first time I used this I did not sweep or do any ‚Äúprep work‚Äù beforehand. It cleaned the entire kitchen and dining room in less than 20 minutes. Left little to no dirt/dust/dog hair behind and mopped the floor as well as I could with a traditional mop. The cleaning solution has a mild and pleasant smell. I am a scent-sensitive person and it did not bother me at all. The tineco is a new cleaning staple in our home!!!",
Scott M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great and under $200!,the United States,17-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I didn't have high expectations for this vacuum, but I am pleasantly surprised how well it works. I have ceramic tile in my entire main level. As a vacuum, it works 100% better than my Hoover cordless. And the wet mop feature works great! My floors have never been so clean.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,the United States,10-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Good for daily light hard floor cleanup. Doesn't do so great on stuck on messes. It's a little touchy especially around thresholds. Going over thresholds often squeezes dirty water from the brush onto the floor. Really nice that it's cordless and worth the price.,

Melly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Timesaver,the United States,18-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love the fact that I don‚Äôt have to sweep first then mop. It‚Äôs all in one!! The only crappy thing is you have to fully clean it after using or it will stink. I also love that it‚Äôs cordless.,

Ashley Mcdaniel,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money!,the United States,21-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I watched several video reviews on this product, I wished I would have listened to the ""bad"" reviews they were the correct ones.  Even with the spot button which increases the suction and cleaning power it does not remove stuck on messes. It will not vacuum up cherios. It leaves a puddle after use. It's easier just to clean the machine then use the self cleaning function. I dont think its worth the money. I will be switching to the Bissell version!",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes cleaning a lot easier,the United States,8-Jan-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This machine makes mopping the floor so much easier since it vacuums while mopping. you don't have to sweep first. it works very well. The only reason that I didn't give five stars is that it needs another scrub head that has more scrubbing power. Doesn't clean up dried liquids like ketchup.,
Cindi,5.0 out of 5 stars,This little machine is great !!!!!,the United States,17-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I just received this yesterday, put it together and charged it.  At first I thought, oh no, this is to small. I used it this morning and to my surprise I did a big part of my house and haven't had to empty the dirty water nor add water. My house is all tile with laminate in the bedrooms.  I have cats, and someone is always puking on my bedroom floor. This little machine got it right off.  I have a larger steam cleaner I've always had to empty, fill, unplug and move. This puts that one to shame.",

Angel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery charge is awful, cleaning performance is awesome",the United States,9-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I only gave this 3 stars because of the battery life. The battery last about 10 minutes when full charged. When I received the vacuum, I charged it for over 5 hours. The charged last about 15 minutes.I have small rooms in my home. I like to go room to room cleaning. Unfortunately, I have to stop after each room and charge for 2 hours before moving to clean another room.  The cleaning performance is superior to any other machine I have purchased.",
Gina Torres,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the price!!,the United States,22-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Vacuum/mop has been a great addition to our cleaning routine. I love that I can vacuum and mop at the same time, with only a few passes.  Great time saver!! Also it‚Äôs great for my children‚Äôs to get there chores done with out the hassle and brooms and the standard mop/bucket. On the other hand for larger rooms you have to stop and refill water and empty the dirty water a few times.

RipMyWallet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not suck up anything,the United States,4-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This product is horrible. There's absolutely no suction. It just pushes the water around the floor. This is the worst product I have ever bought at this price point.,

Natalie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Okay but not great,the United States,3-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This worked great the first couple of times. My only problem with it is that if it is used for too long, it will start pushing out way too much water and leave dirty water all over the floor. Then I have to go back and try and suck up all the excess water. It is great when it comes to just vacuuming the floor, and most times mops okay. It just is a little annoying when you see dirty water starting to get all over the floor after mopping it all clean",
Harley Hamilton,1.0 out of 5 stars,Probably better off with the crosswave or higher model Tineco.,the United States,3-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It worked great for about a week, but now it has almost no suction whatsoever even after I took it apart and cleaned it about 5 times already. Just leaves dirty water puddles everywhere and nothing goes into the dirty water tank.  Self clean function ends up being the tray full of water almost overflowing. Probably the worst money I've ever spent.  Not sure if I can return or not anymore, but I'll certainly be looking into it.",One
Hobby Man,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Deal for the price,the United States,24-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Works great for my sized house.

carly Jane,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money.,the United States,24-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This was my biggest regret buy this far. The suction is not strong at all.

Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great results!,the United States,25-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I've used this for both dry and wet and am very pleasantly surprised with what a good job it does.

Nancyw,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for small spaces,the United States,26-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I use this wet/dry vac to mop the floor in our RV. It works great on the vinyl flooring. It picks up lots of dog hair even though I thoroughly sweep before mopping. I love the self-cleaning feature for the roller. It does use up the water quickly, so I usually have to refill the clean water tank a couple of times while mopping.",
Carla Connington,3.0 out of 5 stars,FYI,the United States,4-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like the convenience of it but it doesn‚Äôt always pick up the dirt.  Sometimes it actually leaves more on the floor, even after emptying it and cleaning roller.",

Doesn't seem to be as heavy as the Cross-wave, but gets the job done the same.  I like the heavy spot feature.  I received it yesterday, and charged it for the recommended 3 hours.  I did our kitchen floor this morning, and worked great.  I would recommend it.",
carol,3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs ok,the United States,1-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It is very good for hardwood floors if you don‚Äôt clean all the rooms.

Kayla Gros,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buy the upgraded model. This one is not good,the United States,1-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Purchased this because i heard many good things about it. It is very loud and doesn‚Äôt dispense water when the button is pressed. Floor is streaking and it sounds like it‚Äôs a huge machine. Tried to return and it won‚Äôt even fit back in the box can‚Äôt get the handle off so I‚Äôm stuck with it. Wishing i would have just spent the extra money to buy the one above this.

Nathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!,the United States,28-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"When my husband decided to purchase this, He was most excited because he thought it would be easier for me. Little did we know this would‚Äôve been one of the worst mop purchases we have ever made. There is absolutely no suction, and depending on the mood to vacuum is it it will either dispense way too much water or very little water. The spot stain remover absolutely does nothing I wish we would‚Äôve never purchased this.",
Cheryl Mirkil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleanliest lightest cordless,the United States,6-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Great on multiple different textures of flooring from bamboo hardwood over a metal strip to adjust height to a laminate flooring. Best vacuum/mop I've ever owned. You can clearly see how dirty the water gets  the only downfall is I wish it had a secondary spare brush and or the option to buy harder Brussels for carpet as this is not meant for area rug or carpet. But I've purchased Dyson's ect. Easiest to clean and it can clean itself then you let it air dry. Best purchase bought it for great grandma too. Thank you Tineco,One

The suction isn‚Äôt very good, the scrub brush doesn‚Äôt seem to touch the floor enough to deep clean and the water distribution is very uneven.

Tiffany Harding,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted about 18 months,the United States,7-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We have used this tool every week and then some for the last 18 months. We have 2 cats and 1800 sq/ft of tiled living space.  For $150-ish dollars, and 75-100 washes, that works out to$1.50-$2.00 a week for an excellent clean. Sadly, it no longer holds a charge so we are looking to replace. We had read reviews that the battery life was short, so we got what we anticipated.

I feel like the battery doesn‚Äôt last very long at all, and it take forever to charge. I also don‚Äôt like how it doesn‚Äôt clean right up against the wall. It leaves like a 1-2‚Äù gap. It‚Äôs great for small spaces, and households that have no pets and maybe 1-2 kids. We have 4 kids, 3 dogs, and a lot of space to clean.",

Flimsy and cheap.,the United States,22-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"After charging overnight, it only lasted a total of 30 minutes before it needed to be recharged. It did work ok while the charge lasted. It takes 3 hours to charge so that's gonna take me a few days to clean all my floors. Also, I expected something a little more sturdy for the price. The tanks are VERY small, so you are constantly changing out the water. I found another brand that has tanks twice the size, at least. It's more sturdy and costs $30 less.Also the delivery tracking was a joke.",One

Sivan Isaiah  Kidd,2.0 out of 5 stars,Price too high for it not to pick up spots,the United States,6-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Doesn't pick up removable spots on hard floors, you have to scrap at it a little just for it to come up.. and I'm talking about spots that are easy to get up with a mop. Either get a more expensive one or save money and get a mop.

The self clean didn‚Äôt work, the suction was good on hardwood floors ( not rugs), but seemed to get clogged a lot. So, I would have to take the vacuum apart and unclog it. When mopping the floors the vacuum would leave dirty water on the floor. That is my opinion though. I am returning the vacuum and didn‚Äôt have any issues with that.

Linda B,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product does a great job!,the United States,4-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have used this on tile floors that needed a really good scrubbing. This product does a GREAT job of getting the dirt and any stains up and out.  I was surprised at how little of the solution is needed to mix with warm water; I followed the directions exactly and have had great results.  I did not use this product on hardwood floors, so I can‚Äôt give a rating for that.",
Jacki,1.0 out of 5 stars,To much water!!,the United States,5-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I would not recommend this unit. I cannot control the water output. It either puts out way to much water or not enough. An hour after using it I still have puddles all over my house that I‚Äôve had to go clean up with a towel. I went to return it today and the return window closed about 7 days ago.,
Nicole Vesper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this machine!!,the United States,26-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love that this can clean so quickly and pick up dust and pet hair that has been missed.  I wish it had a charging dock, but it works just as well without one.",

stephanie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing,the United States,12-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum has made life 100 times easier, especially as a pet owner. Prior to purchasing this I would have to swiffer and roomba everyday, but now I just run this for a minute or two in the morning and evening. Easily picks up any spill. The only semi-con about it is that you HAVE to clean out the bottom dirty water container, otherwise it will smell like musky water after a couple of cleans.",
Courtney,2.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money and buy a steam mop.,the United States,9-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was very excited to order this vacuum/mop. I also have a steam mop and I spent a LOT more time trying to clean up messes with this tineco mop than I do with a steam mop + sweeping. Very disappointed, wouldn‚Äôt purchase for large hardwood floor/tile areas but if you just need it for a small area to vacuum, it could be useful.",
jeremy garcia,1.0 out of 5 stars,It does not self clean,the United States,7-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,says it self cleans maybe mine is just broken however I have to manually clean it after every use because if I do not it smells bad. just spend the extra money for Dyson,

Kim,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product for the price,the United States,10-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I switched from Bissell Crosswave because I was wearing them out yearly, and they refused to issue warranty on the replacement machine. So far, this iFLOOR does the job, nice to be cordless. While the suction is not as strong, the results are what I expected....floors vacuumed and mopped.  If I need to buy another, I will go with the larger machine!",

Nicole,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it & Battery life,the United States,7-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love my tineco ifloor! It‚Äôs perfect for cleaning my floors and picking up any dirt and cat hair. The one thing I dislike about it, is the battery length. Which is one thing I didn‚Äôt read into as much before purchasing. The battery length is about 22 minutes. We have all wood floors through out our house and 22 minutes is not quite enough to finish the whole house. I am usually left with 1-2 rooms not finished mopping before it dies. Just something to keep in mind before purchasing. Other then the battery life I am loving my mop.",
A. Woodall,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,the United States,8-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I used this on a really dirty floor and a mildly dirt floor. Although it got up what I thought was most of the dry mess it left things behind as well. The brushroll is not as wide as the bissell crosswave. Also it left a residue behind. I went over the mildly dirty floor again with the crosswave and and a really dirty tank after just using the Tineco. I'll be returning this.,
Amy Dunphy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Floor cleaner,the United States,9-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for my kitchen to replace the steam mop, it works well but leaves the floor wet unlike the steam mop. But I am happy with it. Price could be better.",

Olivia Kea,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what i was expecting,the United States,27-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this, I had been wanting it for months! When I got it I immediately opening it and put it to use. In my opinion it didn't clean the floor at all, unless it was something easy like dog hair. It left big puddles of dirty water on floor and I still had to scrub my floors the old fashion way to make it feel clean. Not worth the money or the hype. The suction power is poor and it defiantly does not deep clean.",
michael cash,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beware,the United States,4-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I had this product for two weeks. It worked great vacuuming and mopping at first. It streaked really bad though...no matter what I used. By the second week, the suction quit working on the picking up the water and it leaked after turning off. It was returned. Not worth the money.Update: company sent out a new unit and it has been working like it should. No leaks, good suction. Would recommend this.",
katie,1.0 out of 5 stars,It sucks!,the United States,19-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was so excited to use this because of tik tok but I don‚Äôt know how this has more then one star. After the third time using it didn‚Äôt pick up everything off the floor and it leave streaks of brown behind.

James,5.0 out of 5 stars,You need it.,the United States,20-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is an absolute must have! It cleans up after the dogs, the kids, the general mess in the house and more. It sucks up everything I‚Äôve put in front of it!

Estefany Minor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally worth it!!!,the United States,8-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was a little bit skeptical about this vacuum so I looked at all the reviews and videos I could find and decide to buy it, this vacuum is my very best friend now with two little ones on the house this a game changer!!",

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Impressed,the United States,10-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I wasn't impressed. Cons for me 1) You have to use it in a very slow manner in order for it to partially clean. 2) it is NOT for older hardwood floors. Mine are 125 yrs old. 3) It is not for high traffic cleaning!  4) The dirty water compartment would not stay latched.Pros:  ......I'll just mop the old fashioned way.,

Crystal Goblirsch,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great everyday use.,the United States,21-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Great for quick cleaning. Doesn't spray a lot of liquid out or use hard brushes to use for deep cleaning. Works better on hardwood floors than tile. Liquids tend to get stuck in grout lines.,
Jrobb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for keeping your floors swept and clean,the United States,2-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Awesome ! This is light and super easy to use. It cleans and vacuums! It was totally worth it. It saves time and it‚Äôs easy to clean.,

K. Schmidt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Save Time and Clean Better,the United States,9-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Mopping my floors used to be such a chore. First I had to sweep and then I got out the bucket and mop and even when I was done, the floor would have a residue on it. Then I had to clean the mop and bucket! This thing does a better job in less time and then cleans it‚Äôs own roller! It even took crayon marks off my floor!",
KYM,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,the United States,11-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I disliled that no matter how slow I was going I had to move it back and forth over small messes.

I accidentally bought two thinking I could give the other one to a family member but honestly I'm not impressed enough to promote the product.,
Katherine Rivera,5.0 out of 5 stars,My best purchase for cleaning,the United States,12-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love it!! I have a puppy and it really works in absorbing all her fluids (pipi) when we she has accidents and cleans them thoroughly. The cleaning solution that it comes with works like a charm and neutralizes odors. Please just don‚Äôt make the same mistake I made and always ALWAYS clean the dirty tank. I left it one night and I went to use it and it smelled awful. ALWAYS CLEAN THE DIRTY WATER TANK AND THE SPIN BRUSH,
Melissa's Crafting House,1.0 out of 5 stars,This dose not preform like advertised.,the United States,19-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was really excited to use this machine. I never had anything like it before.. I was considering the BISSELL cross-wave but came across this and saw some good reviews on it.. It worked terribly.. I could sweep and mop my floor quicker and get my floors cleaner faster.. This machine took many passes to suck up dirty water and left many dirty streaks. When vacuuming it sprayed the dirt everywhere. I've only had it for two days and I've used it two times. It's so bad that I will not give it third chance. It's going to be returned today.,One
ken,2.0 out of 5 stars,On/Off malfunctioned.,the United States,25-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes for the Tineco wet dry vacuum cleaner.  Unfortunately, the on/off button malfunctioned so I had to return it.  The battery charges great, however, tapping the on/off, to keep it running, stopped working after about two weeks.  Also, there are two little wheels at the back of the vacuum.  The wheels create ""tire tracks"" as you clean the floor.  When the floor is dry, the tracks are there.  I had to wipe them out with a microfiber mop.  It does vacuum and clean the floors well.  I can say that.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the price,the United States,12-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Great on my tile floors, doesn‚Äôt really clean the grout, but I wasn‚Äôt looking for it to do that.

gmanos,4.0 out of 5 stars,Get if you don't have toddlers.,the United States,8-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So, I bought this to see how much easier my life would be.. the scrubbing power is alright. The suction is ok. The run time is the MOST disappointing of all. 22 minutes is not enough to clean my floors. I have to charge in-between kitchen and living room. Probably wouldn't be so bad, but I have a 2 year old.  Not recommended for families with small children.",
JP,4.0 out of 5 stars,"super light, easy and convenient",the United States,21-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I've used multiple products over the years.  This is by far the best.

Asad H.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok for the price,the United States,15-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Doesn‚Äôt get close to the edges at all. Works great in spot clean but the tank fills up quickly and you need to clean it often. Small capacity clean and dirty water storage so you need to refill often. On regular mode it cleans great if you love extremely slow.,
Alberto Hernandez,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great for spot cleaning bad for entire living room,the United States,29-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is definitely only for spill and spot cleaning. It does not work well if your trying to mop a whole living room and kitchen,
Cynthia Peschard,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price,the United States,26-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this product to keep my hardwood floors and area rugs clean, but the vacuum has very poor suction, it does not maneuver well and does not reach into corners. I basically just use it as a mop, since the vacuum feature is useless to me . . . which means it turned out being a very expensive mop.",
LK,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far it has worked pretty well,the United States,3-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have used this once with just water to clean my vinyl floors. It really did a great job and was so easy and light to push.,

Susan Starling,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy this if you want to spend less time on your floors,the United States,21-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have textured tile and this product works just as advertised.  It has cut my floor cleaning time in half because I don't have to sweep and mop.  I have two cats that shed alot and it picks up all of the cat hair no problem.  I can't quite get 950 sq ft clean on one battery charge so if I do half at a time, it is perfect.  Very happy so far.",
Stephanie Randolph,5.0 out of 5 stars,Freaking amazing,the United States,16-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Freaking amazing! Every mom needs one. So sad I just found out about it and waited to purchase it. It's perfect to help keep the house clean with kids.,
Andrew Cornell ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not too shabby,the United States,6-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So far so good, I knew my floors were pretty dirty but didn't realize they were this dirty. It does a way better job than a plane old mop. So far my only complaint is the battery life, I can get my while house done on one charge but still wish it lasted longer or a removable battery would be nice too.",
Hunter,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for quick cleanups.,the United States,25-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"A true ""one step"" floor cleaner is too good to be true, however, I am happy with this purchase for the phase of life we're in. We have a baby that throws food on the floor at every single meal... our floors would be disgusting without this. It's easier to reach for than a mop is, so we love it for that reason. It's definitely not a mop replacement, but a good time saver for us because I can't mop my floors and wash a mop pad 3x a day.",
Jeremy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just Meh!,the United States,12-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Wanted to love it but meh. It sprays water solution when it wants and picks up when it wants. Does not get into corners or close to walls. It will not get difficult spots or bigger messes. Does mediocre on daily dirt. Even after several passes picks up very little water. After using the all of the water solution it only sucks up maybe a half of a cup. I will be going back to my steam mop!,
Sandi Herbert,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,the United States,7-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is an absolute game-changer. For those of you who have tile floors or hardwood floors this is a must have. I've added photos to show how clean it is with no streaks and no lines.

Ah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans up dirty water,the United States,13-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This floor cleaner by far is the best I‚Äôve used.

Annie,3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs ok,the United States,9-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It doesn‚Äôt vacuum up anything.  It‚Äôs great for cleaning my hardwood floors but I guess I missed the part where it isn‚Äôt for actually vacuuming.,
Amy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,the United States,5-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Had really high hopes after seeing such great videos and reviews. I vacuumed the floors first and made sure there was no extras to be picked up; it puts out minimal water.. and I mean very minimal. The suction, I‚Äôm not sure where it was happening. I went slow and made sure to read the instruction manual first. Floors are left streaky, and still dirty. Back to the steam mop!",
supergeek,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good!,the United States,28-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Pleasantly surprised. It does a great job cleaning and is very lightweight and easy to maneuver. Pick up everything and washes the floor pretty well. I wish it had a little more suction for sucking up the water. If def sucks up a good amount of the water but it takes my hard wood floors about an additional 5-10 mins to dry which is a little disappointing. But overall very pleased!,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend,the United States,5-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Great product for every day cleaning. The product does live light streaking on my tile floor.... but with two furry pets I‚Äôll take little streaks over fur & drool spots anyway.,

I have 2 beagles that shed and a boyfriend that works in construction and seems to love tracking mud in but their vacuum/mop tackles the job with ease!! The only downfall is I wish the solution smelt stronger/better, I think I‚Äôm just used to hell fresh and clean my house would smell after using a standard mop.",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Vac mop,the United States,14-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I like it I just don‚Äôt use it enough because it‚Äôs a hassle to clean. If you don‚Äôt clean after each use then it will smell and it‚Äôs impossible to get the smell out. I just would just about rather sweep and mop. Suction power is great though. I did not realize how much hair my daughter and I lost. It is a lot.,

I bought it for after meals cleanup and returned it after 2 days because it‚Äôs not ideal if I have to unclog it almost every time I use it. My friend has one n said I must have got a dud because she loves hers.

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, could be better",the United States,23-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I used a swiffer after doing my entire house with the tineco and the swiffer still picked up a lot of dirt.

Chelsey S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not at all worth the money,the United States,23-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Honestly, save your money. The reviews on TikTok, Facebook, etc sold me on it. It spits everything back out on the floor so you have just as big of a mess as you did before.

Ashlee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hard floors!,the United States,12-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Great if your home is not a majority carpet. Only used once so far but it works great.

Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cuts cleaning time,the United States,3-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Says it‚Äôs for deep cleaning but for a really tough spot you have to go over it a lot. But it does replace to sweep and then mop which cuts cleaning time down by a lot.,

Light weight easy to use no cord to hassle with and the charge lasts forever!  I have owned some other similar products with cords, but for cleaning up messes hassle-free and fast, this is the most convenient mop vacuum I've ever had.  When I did have an issue with it the customer service team was so nice, efficient and responsive I was even more impressed with Tineco.  They replaced my I-floor basically no questions asked. Very happy, and you will be too.",
Mickalie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Battery dies quickly,the United States,15-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really wanted to love this vacuum.

Shelby Graham,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,22-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is good for suction like sweeping but do not recommend for mopping. It leaves streaks on the floor when I‚Äôm using it, I can definitely tell it is not getting the whole floor wet while ‚Äúmoping‚Äù I‚Äôve used mine twice and put it away in the closet. I‚Äôll go back to my swiffer jet. In my opinion not worth the money if you are looking for a sweep/mop combo.",

The only hesitation I have with this machine is the ability to deep clean the grout on the ceramic. For tough spots on grout, you will have to clean by hand.",

Tetyana,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor suction power!,the United States,6-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I bought this because it had great reviews and I even watched a youtube video so I was sold and was excited to receive it.

Destiny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,17-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,With textured flooring this is a must! Mopping and sweeping is so hard on my hands as I have carpal tunnel. But this has been such a blessing! So much easier on my hands! Only reason I chose 4 and not 5 stars is that it doesn't get right up to the trim or the wall and isn't worth it for my stairs.

Judy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too expensive for the quality of the product.,the United States,21-Jun-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I use this product to vacuum and mop my tile floors.  I do not like it nearly as much as I did my Shark Vac and Steam which did a fantastic job.

Julia,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for deep cleaning or large spaces,the United States,13-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This would be better for a smaller apartment or small house/not much hard floors. My 3 bedroom is all hard floors and I have to clean the machine out and clean out the suction 2-3 times. If it‚Äôs for small cleanings or spot cleaning it‚Äôs great but I almost feel like I need to sweep and mop before I use this. My dogs hair doesn‚Äôt help though!

No biggie, just dump water and keep on truckin'",
Don Lucius,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans sufficiently,the United States,2-Sep-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Is great for upkeep, not for heavy cleaning.

I have had two Hoover Floormates and one lasted 2 years but the other only lasted for few months. Both did a good job cleaning tile but the Tineco does just as good. Another feature I like is the automatic brush cleaning.",
Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It works, but not long enough",the United States,30-Mar-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I like that it cleans the floors.

It cleans really well, it's not to hard to clean after use, and is small enough for easy storage when not in use.

dakoda,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe NOT,the United States,28-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I WISH this product cleaned my hardwood floors like it seems in the videos. It leaves a streaky mess at the end and all in all what I've experienced is that it's basically just a vacuum that leaves a wet streak. Doesn't mop the floor. You can see all the lines and grime even from before you vacuum mopped and it's disappointing. It's like the brush on the bottom didn't even touch the ground!,

Mom & Dad,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,the United States,21-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This wet vac does very little. Once on and the spray trigger is hit, it gets wet on the floor and stops even if the trigger is held down.

marc,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works well with Tile,the United States,16-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"There are a lot of cons. You have to constantly empty and refill it. It does not work well on hardwood floors, but works really well on tile. It wasn't really effective at only picking up dirt/fur. I have to sweep before I can think about using it. Overall, I would not recommend buying it.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,1-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"If there is a spot that has been there for a while, you have to go over it a lot and sometimes still doesn't get it but when you have four animals there is also something that  needs cleaned up and it has made that a whole lot easier.

I. Flores,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for full cleaning. Its good for spills.,the United States,14-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It's a good vacuum mop but the tanks are so small and it leaks once it's overfilled.

Thomas F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Having issues with shutting off,the United States,8-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It keeps turning off on me and we have to power off and reset it. It did it the on the first use with my husband and we had placed it on the charger for two days prior to using. Then I tried it the next day and it was going good and started doing it with me. Not sure what the issue is. My daughter has one and loves hers. Has anyone else had this happen?,
Jessica R,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left residue , dog hair stuck to floor",the United States,8-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I wish I could leave zero stars, I debated between this and a bissell crosswave and should have bought the crosswave, I have a lab and a golden retriever, this made there hair stick to the ground it even spit the hair back out if I was using it for more than 20 minutes.

BP,3.0 out of 5 stars,Light to use but just ok to clean,the United States,31-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It leaves streaks even after cleaning/emptying everything. It's light so we want to love it but really wish we did not buy it during Amazon Prime Day.,
Angel Malone,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,the United States,17-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really like this unit but wish that I would have bought the step up.

Emily Jane Sonnier,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ehhh, not worth the hype.",the United States,8-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I don‚Äôt think it was worth the hype. For the price I was expecting a lot more deep cleaning power. The tiniest amount of hair makes the water stop spraying. I‚Äôve even had to sweep beforehand and it still isn‚Äôt great. It‚Äôs more of a hassle to clean the machine to make sure it can work than it actually works. I want to like it but it‚Äôs not worth the hype I thought it was.,

It works better than the Bissell that I borrowed from a friend and is a much better price!,

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt bother if you have pets,the United States,5-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is essentially just a mop. Almost no suction power as a vacuum.

This product does not pick up half of the dirt my Bissell Crosswave did!  Also only gives you about 20-30 minutes before you have to recharge.  The only thing I like was it‚Äôs cordless.  That‚Äôs all I liked!! We bought this because of the good reviews.  I don‚Äôt know why it rated so high!,
DV in Jersey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Works for only a few weeks and then just stopped,the United States,9-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,The vacuum worked fine at the start - really doing a great job on my floors. After a few weeks it will now only run for 3 seconds and then stops. I reached out to support and was told since the return date had passed I could now purchase a warranty.

Kaylynn Wester,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,6-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I was very disappointed with this product. I really wanted to love it but it doesn‚Äôt do well with long dog hair and it leaves a lot of water on the floor for vacuum mop. I ended up returning it.

Maggie McKenna,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,the United States,22-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Maybe I am using it wrong but it is extremely streaky. Only one side of the brush gets wet from the solution and i have to be sure to run that side over where I want it to clean. From the reviews and price I was expecting much better.,
Britny Wiggins,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother,the United States,24-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Doesn't suction very well as a vacuum so I didn't even attempt to use it as a mop yet, I really needed it as a vacuum more than the mopping aspect of the product.",

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Trigger hard to squeeze,the United States,22-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I really enjoy this product except the trigger is very hard to squeeze and little product comes out.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for textured tile floors.,the United States,20-Nov-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The unit is easy to handle and probably works better on wood floors than tile floors. The scrubbing/suction on textured tile floors is not very effective. Had to go over areas several times just for basic cleaning, heavy traffic areas still needed be cleaned by hand. One full charge will only get you about 20 minutes of use.",2
Z,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not very good for mopping, as advertised",the United States,17-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Vacuum power was fair, however mopping dispensing of fluid was erratic.Sometimes it dispensed in clumps, and sometimes pressing on the trigger did not dispense any fluids at all.",
cmix,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,the United States,5-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This makes keeping my floors clean so easy. Love the cordless feature. The boost cleaner works well on the muddy spots my dog creates by the door. You do have to disassemble the tanks and roller after using, but it's easy. It's fairly quiet when operating too.",

Patricia Keiffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,the United States,9-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This wet dry vacuum cleaner is so easy to use. The trick is to go slow. If you do this you will be a really clean floor. I have had two crosswaves that have not held up. The rollers quit working. This is a different set up for the roller.,
Chanel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not that great,the United States,27-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Overall the vacuum is OK definitely not worth the money though,
Maria Arias,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't BUY!!!!,the United States,5-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I purchased this product a month ago and on my second week the front part broke and today the back came off.

DeeDee Moore,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't recommend!,the United States,12-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I went to go buy the cordless max crosswave and started seeing videos about the tineko, of course the tineko was WAY cheaper than the bissell. I've had this a couple weeks and I'm NOT impressed, I'm just not, I had the 1st Bissell crosswave before I bought the tineko, sold it for this and I'm so upset about it! Wouldn't recommend this! Would definitely recommend the Bissell though!!",
tara,1.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely poor suction,the United States,30-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The first use of the floor cleaner was magic. After than went WAY down hill. It doesn't vacuum up the dirty water just pushes it around. Started using it as just a vacuum on the ceramic tile, just blows dirt everywhere. I have contacted support awaiting a reply.

zac sheeley,1.0 out of 5 stars,Id rather use a sponge mop,the United States,24-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Takes as long to clean my kitchen floor as it does to steam clean my livingroom carpet.

Zoeller,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed. Kids and pets,the United States,27-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Worked fine for the first 5 minutes.

Left a puddle of dirty water on numerous occasions despite being cleaned out thoroughly.,
Amanda Hutchison,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted it to be true,the United States,11-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This is a very cheap product.

Kayla,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mom must have!,the United States,16-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"As a mom of twin toddlers learning to eat, this has been my best friend in the kitchen! WAY better than getting on my hands and knees after every meal to pick up the food and scrub the floor. Such a time saver! Cleaning in out can be nasty and you should definitely do it often, otherwise it starts to stink, but still worth it!",
megan dockery,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,27-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love this thing. I did learn to vacuum with it before then use the mop button. When mopping and vacuuming everything got too wet and wouldn‚Äôt go in the vacuum. But this is great for saving time on sweeping and mopping.,
Sandra Rodriguez,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not recommend for large areas.,the United States,3-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Does not work well for large spaces or tile. It requires cleaning and refills every 5 minutes.  Not worth the trouble or the money. I regret buying this.,

Amazonjunkie33,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for a big house in my opinion.,the United States,22-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I think this is meant for a smaller space. It took a long time to do my main floors of my house as they are all hard wood. Also the hair from the animals seems to be a lot for this machine to keep up with.,
Valerie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,the United States,8-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,The reviews were so misleading. No one talks about how you have to clean every single part every time you use it. What's the point of the self cleaning tray if you have clean before and after each use. Very disappointed,

Kodi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Picks up everything left behind!,the United States,21-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,So far so good! I wish I would‚Äôve took the leap with a more fancier version but this one gets the job done. We have a corgi so I still sweep before using this in effort to not ruin my machine.

Shopper,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Does not work, don't waste your money",the United States,1-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Moved dust,  dirt and pet hair around. Does not pick anything up.

Dean ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Requires Extensive Cleaning,the United States,11-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Bought this after watching reviews/seeing on Tik Tok, if you're doing minimal cleaning it works fine, but requires a thorough cleaning of the machine after every single use; hair and dust mixes with water from mop in one compartment and is disgusting to empty. Almost better off using a broom and mop.",

Renelle Staus,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,the United States,28-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This product works fairly well. Does leave water on floor which may have to be mopped up.

Tiny Pepperdine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would buy again,the United States,29-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Not the best for textured ceramic tile but that is to be expected.  A few passes over the same spot are needed to completely clean each tile.,

Kristen Bear,3.0 out of 5 stars,50/50 pro to con ratio,the United States,22-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs nice for mopping hardwood floors, but as a vacuum, I was expecting more. I have two dogs that shed but it is short and thin hair and you‚Äôll be finding yourself having to empty out the littlest bit because it clogs SOOO easy. Contemplating on getting rid of it because of this isssue. I was definitely expecting more out of this than it is...",

I don‚Äôt know what else to call it.So if we use it now, after 3 months old, it SMELLS. We‚Äôve even tried bleaching it! Nothing has taken the nasty smell out and I feel like I‚Äôve wasted hundreds.",One
Robert Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,There‚Äôs no debris or pet hair left on the floors,the United States,5-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This product was easy to set up and easy to work.

I have 3 children and 2 dogs, I really put it to the test!",
ldharvey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my Tineco iFloor,the United States,8-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This product is magnificent.  I have a cat and dog that shed like crazy.

Adrian Flores,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase!!!,the United States,22-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Given how small and light weight this is, I wasn't expecting the results that I got! I had mopped my floor with my swiffer wet jet the day before my iFloor arrived. Once assembled I went over my hardwood floors again and the amount of dirt and grime in the dirty water tank was very surprising! This little guy gets the job done and done well!",
Wendy,5.0 out of 5 stars,It does a good job!,the United States,27-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"We have four dogs in the house! Two of them are crazy shedders, so keeping the floor clean is a huge struggle! This machine saves me so much time by vacuuming and mopping at once! It does a great job too! Certain solutions leave streaks, so experiment with that. Also, I find it better to get the brush wet first. You must clean it after each use but really easily done!!",

Sheryl Brenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Efficient time saver!,the United States,8-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really like this! I have quite a large area of vinyl flooring and this is a real timesaver. It picks up a lot of dirt and mops without leaving puddles. The battery life lasts a pretty long time.

sebastian,1.0 out of 5 stars,Never worked,the United States,5-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Tried to make it work so many times. I just gave up.,
Kala Clark,1.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,the United States,2-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This vacuum is an example of you get what you pay for (compared to the bissellcrosswave) it leaves streaks of dirty water even when you overlap to try and suck it up. More of a headache if you ask me. Wouldn‚Äôt waste the money on it.,
JL,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,3-Nov-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Waited forever for this product and I‚Äôm so disappointed. Can not get it to self clean like everyone says. Also, roller doesn‚Äôt rotate like it should. Still dirt on floor after I use this.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Quality,the United States,26-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So after only owning this two months the battery no longer charges. In addition, the self clean mode leaves the roller musty and emits odors. You have to basically break it down everytime you use to keep it from smelling. The suction is okay but its clearly not worth the money you pay for this vacuum/ mop.",
UhmmmNooo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Cleaning Tile,the United States,17-Dec-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"For someone who hates to clean floors - and hates dirty floors even more - this is a God send! :) It's so satisfying to use. If you're skeptical about the off-brand and lower price, don't be. I did a ton of research, and then decided to buy. It's extremely easy to use and is very effective; I haven't yet found a spot on my floor (I haven't effectively mopped in a while, and I've been using my Shark vac) that it couldn't clean to perfection.",
Gilles,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great device!,the United States,18-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I'm actually pleasantly surprised by the thing. It cleans well on hard floor, it vacuums well too.

Steve Brosnan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I needed,the United States,10-Jul-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Perfect for what I need. Glorified Dustbuster which is what I need.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,the United States,3-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Definitely disappointed at the beginning it worked ok but a few weeks using it I can say that it does not replace mop to actually sanitize the floor. I wish I had not purchased it.,One

Too short of a lifespan for the price.",

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Okay vacuum,the United States,25-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It‚Äôs a good vacuum as far as suction but with the water in it you have to continuously clean it ( like after every time you use it)or it gets stinky.,One

I love that it doesnt have a cord to carry around. It's super easy to clean. I dont like the solution that comes with it. I also dont like that it doesnt pick things up near the wall. I wish it had a hose to it. Overall. Good machine for the price.,
Brittany,1.0 out of 5 stars,No,the United States,8-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Literally a waste of money. DO NOT BUY. Just sprays water on your floors and doesn‚Äôt pick it all up you have to go over it six times just to pick some of it up! I ended up walking around with a towel wiping water up.,
Madison,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this machine!,the United States,12-Jul-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love the convenience! It has good scrubbing power and makes cleaning my hard wood floors much less time consuming! I used to vacuum my floors first, then mop.  The whole process took me around an hour now I can do it all in one step. Takes me about 20 minutes. The only draw back is the mop head won‚Äôt clean right up against  your mop boards. The vacuum does a good job getting all the dust and dog hair though.",
Em,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay. Good price I think.,the United States,28-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really loved this product when I first received it. Its lightweight, easy to clean, and doesnt take up a lot of space. However, I think it's just pushing around the dirt now. I've cleaned, charged, and made sure there were no blockages. Its fast becoming annoying. Still mops great though!",
Josiah,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky floors,the United States,23-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,The vacuum part was fine for this. The problem was that it left floors sticky. For me it just wasn‚Äôt worth spending all that money for a sub par machine.,One

Potpie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good vacuum cleaner,the United States,27-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I just purchased this cleaner so can't say too much (yet). It isn't as quiet as I anticipated (based on the video) but definitely not a huge issue. Assembly was very easy and so far, after using it twice, it seems to work like it is supposed to. As of today I'm happy with it.",
Amy Worthington,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great suction, great maneuverability",the United States,8-Apr-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is great for small areas, has as much suction as our hoover plug in model, much easier to use being that it is cordless. It does have a fairly small dirt canister and needs emptied after each room and the filter gets dirty and stops having suction after 20-30 minutes of use. It does come with a 2nd filter though so you can use it until the other is dry after cleaning it.",

Linda S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt buy unless you plan on cleaning the whole vacuum after ‚Äúmopping‚Äù.,the United States,25-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,First of all the easy to use/ convenience factor sucked me in (no pun intended). The suction is horrible and if left without taking apart and cleaning after each use the smell that the wet cloth on the vacuum has is horrid. So unless you have time to clean after cleaning this is not a time saver/ worth the money.,
Denise J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed...,the United States,11-Aug-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"with how well it cleans my hardwood floors and all I have been using is very warm water.

Emily,3.0 out of 5 stars,Streaks on laminate,the United States,18-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Product works well but it does leave streaks on laminate flooring.

Anisha Richesson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kinda okay!,the United States,14-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs does alright on my hard wood floors, does tend to push some stuff around rather than suck it up.

heather lane,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight easy to use,the United States,12-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I only have hard wood and area rugs so this worked perfect. If you have carpet I don‚Äôt see this being powerful enough for a deep clean, but if you used this everyday I think it would keep them clean.

Even with careful use and proper care. I reached out to customer service. It was verified the product was in fact defective and then have not followed up with shipping packages/instructions for replacement.

Nicolas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum.,the United States,1-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Great product. Used it on my 100 year old hardwood floors that came with the house.

Becky K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I think it‚Äôs great!,the United States,26-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I use this on hardwood and tile almost daily as I have a dog that sheds.

Raleigh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced for half the time,the United States,26-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"When the product works it is nice to have as it definitely works well on the vacuum portion. However the mop is much to be desired as it only puts out the water as you are cleaning half of the time. Its battery life is also horrible, so if you have large spaces plan for it to take you more than one attempt.",
elena v. byars,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my pet vacuum,the United States,21-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love the efficiency  of the vacuum and the easiness to take apart and clean.

I have a toddler and if you have kids you know they spill things a lot. This is the perfect tool for cleaning up their spills without having to use multiple things.

Thom,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice idea but not as practical as expected,the United States,31-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Very impressed with the idea of this mop, however prone to smell even with washing out after every use and leaving out to dry. Does not hold a lot of the clean & dirty water, so frequent trips to empty/ begin again. Sweeping is still needed prior if you‚Äôre looking at food bits or dog hair.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,10-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Not even worth the 1 star. Don't waste your money if you have pets or kids.  Suction is horrible and the mop is even worse. Run a self cleaning cycle and it leaks water everywhere the next time you try to use it and let's off a horrible smell. Worst purchase I've ever made.,
Julia4200,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn‚Äôt work like they say!,the United States,13-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This does not clean like it claims to. It doesn‚Äôt get anywhere close to the trim.  About 1 1/2 in. Away at best. It is easy to use. But have to wash everything between each use. Yo just get an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù clean. Not worth the money.,

Susan Dixon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money!,the United States,15-Oct-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I am so sorry I spent the money on this vac.  It has no cleaning power whats so ever.  Multiple times going over one spot, and it still does not remove it.  Leaves dirty streak marks all over the floor, and does not stay charged long enough to do one large room.  I have the Hoover electric, and it does a much better job.  I thought a battery operated one would be handy, but the whole thing is too small and lightweight.  I will stick with the Bissell or the Hoover in the future.",One

I have light floors that show dirt very easily so I wanted something that i could grab quickly to pick up visible dirt. This is not that.

T. Ryan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cleanup is a chore,the United States,18-Jul-19,iFLOOR,,"They almost got this right.  It works pretty much as described.  It leaves a little liquid on the floor but picks up most of it.  It's light and easy to handle.  I was satisfied with how it cleaned.  I think it did better than a mop and bucket.  I didn't have any problems with streaking on my tile or wood floors.  There were a lot of warnings about using harsh cleaners or foaming liquids in the water tank, but I used a little household cleaner in the water and a wood floor cleaner without a problem.  The quality of the fit and finish of the unit was better than I expected.There were some minor irritations.  It did not clean all the way to the baseboards and if the floor has dips and bumps the nap of the brush is too short.  Battery life is just OK.  The English usage in the instructions was clear enough, but not the best.The main problem is the cleanup.  Sweeping or dry vacuuming prior to cleaning is worth the extra effort especially if there is any long hair or pet hair to deal with.  When finished there are 8 pieces to be cleaned, rinsed and dried before being reassembled.  Many of the pieces have nooks and crannies that can not be reached easily and water does not drain completely from some pieces.  For a bathroom,  I spent more time cleaning the vacuum than I did cleaning the floor.  A little forethought and a few design tweaks could have helped here.",4

saspinner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked pretty good,the United States,3-Jun-21,iFLOOR,,"This worked better for me than my previous Floormate. I did not buy this at Amazon because I got it $30 cheaper at a big box store. But that is not going to stop me from leaving my review.It is not what I would call baby quiet. But quieter than the average vacuum. The amount of cat hair and dirty water from what I thought was a pretty clean floor surprised me because Roomba had already run in all parts of the house. It got up some pretty big dirty spots. The cleaning procedure is very much like the Floormate. You have to rinse and dry the parts. Overall, I will give it an overall 5 star rating because I have high hopes for this vacuum. My farmhouse gets a lot of sand in it, so when I take it out there to use, I will update my review. I used it on tile and laminate already. The farmhouse has wood grained vinyl. So I will be able to test it on multiple surfaces. I took away 1 star from deep cleaning because the Floormate had a little more power. I was interested in the cord-free and lower weight options, so I am pleased overall.",
Amanda Weber,1.0 out of 5 stars,I'd rather mop. Not for people with dogs.. or dust.. or dirt..,the United States,22-Dec-20,iFLOOR,,"I got this as a Christmas present from my boyfriend after my shark vacuum called it quits. I had heard raving reviews from a coworker and was very excited to try this.Now I am very disappointed.I used it once to clean my entrance way and living room, which both are not very large spaces. I had to remove the cover from the roller 7 times to rinse it, and then with the cover off I would run the sprayer for a solid 1-2 minutes to clean the junk off the roller so it would work again.By the end it was leaving puddings of nasty debris on my floor that I ended up having to clean up with a paper towel.My floors look no different than if I had swept.It also leaves an obnoxiously obvious gap at the walls because it doesn't reach far enough, and its impossible to tilt the vacuum up so it'll get the corners like you can in most vacuums.. I still had to go in and mop that.When my boyfriend gets home I'm going to ask him to return it since it's trash. I'd rather just mop. I'll be purchasing a shark vacuum instead, so I could also vacuum my carpets.Yes it was fully charged.Yes I used the supplied solution.Yes I followed the directions.I have dogs, I assume every vacuum company accounts for that.Apparently this one did not.",One
caesarea maya,2.0 out of 5 stars,DON‚ÄôT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE,the United States,18-Apr-21,iFLOOR,,"like so many others i saw the tineco all over tiktok it looked amazing, mopping is extremely tiring and i get callous from all the friction between my hands and the mop handle. so i finally took the leap and ordered it. i knew it wasn‚Äôt gonna be perfect and leave my floors clean enough to eat off of i didn‚Äôt even expect it to suck everything up. because i intended to use this as a quick clean for late nights or days when i didn‚Äôt want to full on mop. so i dealt with all the minor imperfections, the first thing that bothered me was the fact that the trigger is extremely hard to squeeze. it doesn‚Äôt suck up close to the edge of the wall. and it doesn‚Äôt clean very well, after using it and taking a napkin to the floor there was still dirty residue. however that was all minor. i went to use it today and it was just not working at all i went over an entire area not realizing that as i was squeezing the trigger no water was coming out. had to use two hands to squeeze the trigger hard enough to get water to come out and when it did it was just spreading dirty water on the floor which i never experienced before but have read others complain about. it has managed to do the opposite of what i bought it for, it has made cleaning the floors even more difficult for me. and i no longer have the patience to dismiss all the little problems i am returning mine. super unsatisfied, just stick to your regular mop! don‚Äôt risk ending up with this headache.",
Jan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Would be Nice if Every Feature Worked for More Than a Month,the United States,22-Mar-21,iFLOOR,,"I bought this because I was tired of Hoover's declining quality, and I liked that it was cordless.  However, I had it for maybe a month or so & suddenly the roller-cleaning feature didn't work correctly.  It is supposed to shut off automatically, but it ran & ran, and I had to stop it manually.  Then I noticed that it wasn't cleaning the roller.  Clean water is supposed to be used and go into the dirty water tank.  Nothing was happening, so now I have to hold the trigger down while it's running in order to clean the roller.  Very disappointed, otherwise I could say I loved it.  I wish companies would manufacture quality products.  I know someone who was going to buy one, and I told her of the trouble I had with mine, and she has changed her mind.",
Stephanie Graham,4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes cleaning easier.,the United States,4-Jan-20,iFLOOR,,"Bought an A11 a few months ago after watching the review on Vacuum Wars.  I‚Äôm not good at cleaning and it made vacuuming feel so easy.  I just bought a new house with about 2100 sf of vinyl plank so I knew I needed something to help me keep it clean. This is a god send. Almost bought the cross wave because it claims it can be used on ‚Äúlow pile rugs‚Äù but really they mean you can use it as a dry vac on the rugs and the wireless Bissell is close to $300.Anyway, this little guy is awesome. The base on it is narrow enough that you can get it in smaller spaces. It‚Äôs easy to use. The battery is generous.It sucks having to clean all the parts when you are done but this is no different from other similar wet/dry vacs.I used it on ceramic tile at my old house and was unhappy with how much liquid was left in the grooves of the grout. I also think the cleaning solution smells gross. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.It also comes with a little scrub brush that also has a small razor folded in so you can cut any hair that gets wrapped around the roller. I thought that was very cool and will have to use that with my A11 as well.",
Sandra Matos,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and easy to use.,the United States,7-Sep-20,iFLOOR,,"Love how easy to setup all parts. Intended for small areas at once. The water bins are relatively small but very effective for the purpose. Once the dirty water bin is full you must remove and clean the filter and cap. It is extremely easy; just dump it and run clean water on those parts. The only obstacle I found is that these parts, the bin, cap, and sponge must be completely dry before placing them back in order to continue running the machine. You are able to do this by placing the extra sponge filter included. I will get another sponge for me to have like 4 or 5 dry sponges on hand. The sponge is just like a regular dishwashing foam, so you don‚Äôt need any special equipment. So it is really affordable. The battery time lasts about 3 uses where you dump the dirty water and refill the tank. This is about one medium room per tank.  In my case I am not able to do heavy work time at cleaning due to spine surgery. It is perfect for me. Though this is not the model for whole house cleaning. I am really in love my iTineco. No more carrying the clean and dirty water buckets. I met my goal very well. Thank you Tineco.",

GET IT!!!Is it gonna power scrub like a hands and knee scrub will....no. But if after youve given your floor a good spring clean ""once""....this will keep you maintained!! It sucks up pethair and anything your kids can toss while eating like a champ. Its easy to empty and fairly quiet. I managed to do my kitchen and both baths on one tank. And honestly dont mind the scent of the cleaner although i prefer bissels solution if im honest. Now those of you asking if i like this or the bissels counterpart better. This one!

We do not have carpet and my floors are nice and clean in a quarter of the time it takes me to sweep and mop. I have a cat a dog. It handles hair with ease!

Jonathan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Why no cord?!,the United States,28-May-21,iFLOOR,,This product does work pretty well. It won't clean up stuck on messes but it gets the job done on probably 85% hardwood floor issues and small rugs. I am going to return it because the battery life of 20 minutes just will not cut it for a normal size home with hardwood throughout the living room and kitchen. I went with the crosswave because of the cord. It's unfortunate Tineco does not offer a corded model as I would certainly have kept it as the cleaning process is a little easier than the Crosswave.,
Socheath Chhim,1.0 out of 5 stars,Warranty claim very difficult. Was a great floor cleaner before it stopped working.,the United States,4-May-21,iFLOOR,,Lasted only a year after light use. First issue was it would run and turns itself off after 1 minute use. I plugged it into the charger and after a full day of charging it no longer turns on. I contacted customer service and they requested to follow the steps given to resolve the issue. It didn't work. Then they requested a video. Then they state the solution was cloudy and to only use the preferred solution. It is the original solution  from the unit. It was just  sitting there for two weeks from not working. Usually i clean the unit very well after each use. I am very unsatisfied with how they handle their 2 year warranty claim. Buyers beware,
Chelsie Cressionnie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely Frustrated!!!!,the United States,14-Jun-21,iFLOOR,,"DO NOT PURCHASE! I debated for a whole year on purchasing one of these. A whole year! And my friend bought one and she loved it. She believed best purchase she could ever buy, when comes to mopping. So I broke down and bought one in February. When I first bought it I assembled and let it charge for six hours. Well I thought that should be enough time only used the solution it came with. Mopping my floors great but died after about 30 minutes of use. I don‚Äôt have carpet in my house and it‚Äôs an 1800 square footage house so I would mop one room at a time, but throughout the day I would clean it just as the instructions said to do, and I began to notice a HORRIBLE smell. Like every time I used it after I could smell a disgusting smell. I just started adding more solution and a capful of bleach just to get rid of the smell and it worked great!! Then last week the battery started doing the same thing. Except this time it was only 15 minutes at a time. It was frustrating and now I‚Äôm trying to mop my floors and it won‚Äôt even come on.  I‚Äôm so frustrated that I now have a $175 floor ornament. I didn‚Äôt purchase a warranty or at least I don‚Äôt think I did, I purchased it on my husbands Amazon.My friend still loves hers and uses it often but I wouldn‚Äôt recommends",

Just buy it. Don't pass go, just click buy now. You will not regret it. My floors look and feel clean, no easy feat with 3 dogs. I didn't sweep before and this sucker (pun intended) worked like a champ. Had to stop to clear one time when it sucked up part of a tennis ball.  But that was my fault testing the machine.

DanielleMomOf4,1.0 out of 5 stars,The cleaning of the machine is ROUGH,the United States,18-Jul-21,iFLOOR,,"I wanted one of these so bad for so long! Finally got one! I hate it. HATE!  They clog up so fast when there's pet hair. They smell bad if you forget to clean it out right after you use it. They leak really bad! The suction power is great the first day and trash after that. They are worthless for anything that isn't freshly spilled. But, if you live in a home with no kids, no pets, no dust or dirt or a husband who works outside... Then it would be great! But for families that live, nope, worthless waste of money!",
janine g,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good concept for everyday little messes.,the United States,25-Jun-21,iFLOOR,,"This is a great concept. I love this vacuumop for everyday messes and general clean. That being said, it is not a deep cleaning solution as it will only reach the general areas. Not good for nooks and crannies. That is relatively obvious. Only issue I found is that, although it is easy to clean and the pieces come apart and go back together simply, it has to be cleaned after every use as it will smell bad if not cleaned immediately.",
Jaime,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just. Buy. It. Better than Bissel!,the United States,3-Jan-21,iFLOOR,,"I rate this 4 stars, because who doesn‚Äôt want to save time? It did a great job on our floors, hubby was even impressed. It‚Äôs lightweight, easy to clean & use. The only downfall is the clean tank is larger than the dirty tank; so mid cleaning it started to leak (I was confused), but I found it was because the dirty tank was full. As soon as I emptied it, it was fine again. I love this thing so much, my husband got it for me for Christmas & I am stoked about it!",

They take more than 48 hours to even get a response. I was told to send a veido where they stated my machine needed to be replaced and they would send me a return label to send it back and send me a new one. That was supposed to be a week ago, no one will call me. I have 3 children and when purchased I threw out all my old mops. I am now without and no one will answer whats going on. Beware.",One

I have three dogs. I at first vacuumed before using this as not to clog it or overwhelm it. But then one day threw my cares into the wind and tried it without vacuuming prior. It did fantastically. I do have to change out the water once in order to finish my down stairs but I have a lot of tile.",
David Baker,3.0 out of 5 stars,Love it hate it,the United States,17-Apr-21,iFLOOR,,Ive got laminate floors and some room tarrazo. The vac works fine and all that. Its not really awful to clean but it's way more involved than a sponge mop. If you use it today and let it ferment overnight tomorrow that brush will be a stinker ready to spread the love all over your floor. So it's not the best for grab and use and then just put away until next time. It really should be cleaned after every use. Any brand of them I would imagine. It cleans ok and is quick. Does an OK job. Any dirt vacd up will be wet so dumping it is a consideration. Where do you want to dump wet dirt. In the bin? In the sink? In the toilet? In the yard? üòÑ I'm just offering my thoughts on it so you can decide what you want.,
Heidi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life saver!,the United States,16-Jun-20,iFLOOR,,My husband bought me this vacuum because I was constantly cleaning the floors due to our little boy crawling around on them on the time and I just couldn‚Äôt keep it.

Makayla Myers,3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs alright,the United States,18-May-21,iFLOOR,,"I loved this when I first got it, I had no complaints and thought it got my house really clean. After having it for about 6 months now I feel like it doesn‚Äôt work as well. It doesn‚Äôt pick up bigger/slightly heavier items mainly just dirt and crumbs. Also it leaves a disgusting puddle of water when you turn it off. I‚Äôve found that it clogs SUPER easy and for the amount of water I was using for the mop aspect the dirty water tank didn‚Äôt match up. I feel like I spend more time cleaning the until after each use than I do cleaning with it. My biggest complaint is it smells. Regardless of how much I scrub the brush and all other parts it still reeks. I just ended up biting the bullet and spent the money on the bissel crosswave. Overall it‚Äôs good for spot cleaning but don‚Äôt recommend it for whole house.",
audrey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Could be better,the United States,21-Mar-21,iFLOOR,,My husband got this for me for Christmas so I've had it about 3 months and I use it often and want to love it. Nothing gets sucked into the chamber it all just gets clogged in the bottom. I have to stop every couple of minutes to use the little tool it came with to dig it all out and continue cleaning. Because of this the mop feature is horrible because it just gets clogged even faster and leaves the dirt all over the floor.,

I have 3 young, messy kids so when messes happen I need to be able to use it right then and not wait for it to charge. I also use it for cleaning my vinyl wood floors throughout my whole house (1900sqft) and it could only get through 1/3 of my house before dying. I went with the Bissel Crosswave and have been much happier with that, because it‚Äôs ready on demand, powerful enough to get up tough messes, and it has a better vacuum capability.",One

It really cuts down on cleaning time, although I do recommend that if your floor is really dirty to at least do a quick sweep with a regular broom to not get the roller too dirty. One thing we love is the self cleaning function. It‚Äôs relatively low maintenance and comes with an extra dry filter and cleaning solution. We are generally really clean and hardly ever have big spills (no children), so for cleaning up footprints and light dust/dirt it‚Äôs served it‚Äôs purpose very well, we use it every day. Battery life could be a little better, but ~20ish minutes is plenty of time for moderate cleaning. I‚Äôd definitely purchase again!",

John Laub,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for textured floors,the United States,1-Jun-21,iFLOOR,,"Unless your floor is completely flat and untextured, it won't work well.

honeychile,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and easy for everyday cleaning,the United States,15-Apr-19,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Yes, this is a high-rated REAL review by someone who had actually bought and used the product.  The Tineco iFloor Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner is not an industrial product and will not undo months of neglect, which is what I had on my hands.  So, yes, I had to take the time and elbow grease to first clean behind the fridge and other big-problem spots.  But once that was done, this is the PERFECT ""keep it clean"" machine.  It's super lightweight, easy to set up quickly, easy to clean, and battery lasts about 25-30 minutes, which is enough for me to clean my kitchen and bathroom.  Because it sprays a thin layer of cleaning liquid and vacuums much of that up, I've found that I get the machine out to take care of a small problem (dropped an egg, spilled the brown sugar), but then I usually just go ahead and do the whole floor because it only takes a minute or two and dries just as quickly.  My floors have never been so clean or looked so good.  I have a cat and a dog and I had greatly discounted their shed fur as a problem on the floors, but whenever I see what's in that sucked-up dirt/liquid container, I am amazed how much pet hair is in there.  So, if you're expecting some behemoth machine that you'll unleash on your unsuspecting floors, the Tineco is probably not for you. But if you're looking for a lightweight mop/broom combo for use every day or two, then I believe you'll enjoy and appreciate this appliance.",9
Anna Foster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I expected, but still good experience!!",the United States,12-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I really didn't think when I like this product, the display was good and the product setup was nice, sleek. I guess, I just wasn't expecting so much work for a vacuum/mop.  However, now that I have read the instructions and know how to use it, it is super easy.  There are still times I will say, however, some actual scrubbing of a spot with a wash rag is required.  The mop does a great job of vacuuming. The mop itself says to only push the cleaner release button when you pull the mop back but if you push it to go forward and backward it cleans better.  The only thing I don't like is you cannot take off the roller to wash it that I know of.  There a quite a few pieces you have to clean: under the front the plastic piece, and dumping out the water from the debris and that hole where it connects, and then filling up the cleaner/water container when it runs out.  Also, a cap of cleaner with water to the fill line! DO NOT fill the whole tank with cleaner. Now that I know what to do when I vacuum/mop it isn't that hard and it beats mopping, light weight and does not hurt my back.  The mop charge last a long time and just be aware of the different lights and what they mean.  Also, DUMP WATER OUT OF BIN AFTER EVERY USE. -OR-it will SMELL HORRIBLE! If the mop randomly stops, it needs to be charged!! 5/5 stars!! I love this mop now that I have got the swing of it.",76
Kasie Keys,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase!! Buy it!,the United States,14-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE: We had small chimney fire and had to call the fire department. Between the stove and the firemen my house was a black mess! I swept with a regular broom but it was still all black. Within 5 minutes of using this machine my floor was so clean!! I‚Äôm extremely impressed!!!I have only had my machine a few days and have used it a few times so far. The unboxing and assembly was super simple by 9 year old could do it! Included instruction manual was very well written so there was no questionable operation issue. I‚Äôm not sure if it came fully charged as I didn‚Äôt have time to use it immediately so i just placed it to charge.The machine is visibly appealing, doesn‚Äôt look over bearing like a Bissell. It‚Äôs extremely lightweight and so easy to maneuver! The noise is less than a vacuum but not silent...the noise doesn‚Äôt bother me at all!I love that you can sweep alone or sweep and mop. You can clean a dirty spot really quick. I wiped an area after cleaning and there was no residue! The floors dry very quickly. Actually so quick I had to touch the floor to be sure it was even mopping! There‚Äôs a spot button for extra power which does work well!As far as cleaning the machine after using..it‚Äôs really not bad. You can either dump liquid down the drain and strain the large pieces or just dump it outside. I then rinsed everything off dried with a towel, added more cleaner and stuck in the charger for self cleaning mode to clean the brush inside. So far it‚Äôs not been a hassle. I‚Äôve swept up pretzels, toast, Christmas tree shedding and general toddler messes without any issues!Overall, I‚Äôm very impressed with this purchase!",2

Hilary Buckland,2.0 out of 5 stars,This is not for heavy duty cleaning - this is more like a shop vac,the United States,4-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this as an emergency backup for my dead Bissell while waiting for the replacement Crosswave to arrive. It has no scrubbing ability at all. It does absolutely nothing to get up stuck on food droplets. I didn't even bother to try it in my foster cat room since if it can't clean egg white or tomato sauce spots on high gloss tile it clearly won't do anything on cat ""output"" on wood. I tried it in one bathroom and it couldn't even clean up a roll-on deodorant droplet.It does a pretty good job of vacuuming small debris and sucking up the water, but the solution that comes with the machine leaves streaks like crazy. You have to rinse the entire floor with plain water to get rid of the cloudy streaks. The only reason I'm not returning it is that I really do need a backup machine. Also, it's adequate for all the rooms in the house the cats can't go, meaning rooms that just need a light mopping and not a real ""cleaning"".The best thing about it is that it's cordless.Bottom line: the Tineco is better than the Hoover Floormate (the WORST), but nowhere near as good as the Bissell Crosswave.",
Jess,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ehh, I expected better.",the United States,18-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this machine along with my mother because we have been hearing so many good things about it and seeing many good reviews as well.First out of the box the machine looks nice, was easy to get together and pretty easy to set up with water and cleaner as well.After trying this machine out on my hardwood floors I just have a problem justifying it being almost $200. I had some tea that one of the kids spilled on the floor and had dried and it literally took a while of scrubbing and me having to spray cleaner directly on the floor to get it up, and I did try it on other things like yogurt and stuff as well. The machine works okay but I don‚Äôt feel like I should have to sit there and go over the same spot so many times to get anything up, I thought this would make my life easier but it was very time consuming.",One
Gungo,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good option for fast cleanups - but machine stopped charging after about a month. Refund Issued.,the United States,18-Aug-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Update to Original Review: I loved this when I received it and used it for about a month before it just stopped working.  The power switch didn't activate anything - it was just a dead machine. I contacted Tineco and had a very prompt response to test several things, which I did with no results.  The battery seemed not to be charging. They promised to send a shipping label which never arrived.  After about 6 times asking for the shipping label - I finally got exasperated and demanded a supervisor - at which point they just issued a refund without returning the Tineco mop/vac.Based on this - I would not buy again.  However, I loved it when it worked for the first month.  I almost wish that they had sent a replacement that worked as expected.  But with the long wait for a solution, I wouldn't order again.  Not because of the product, but because of the difficulty replacing within warrantee period.------- Original Review --------While this won't substitute a good old heavy spring cleaning - it works great for routine mop/vac.  None of these types of mop/vacs do very well on corners and odd-shaped areas, but for open spaces it works great.  Surprisingly good vacuum for a small machine and the mop works great.I've used it almost exclusively on tiles - but fabric and coco foot mats get cleaned very well.The spot cleaning button really makes a difference on areas I didn't think it would clean.Battery life is good between charges for my 3 bedroom house.Cleanup is a bit complicated, but only takes a few minutes.Best thing is that there is no cord to get trapped on furniture or limit your work area.After a month of usage, I really like it and would recommend.",2
Breanna Call-Stephens,3.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible on smooth surfaces; just ok on textured floors,the United States,4-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This device is really amazing. The reason that I gave it less than five stars is that if you have floor with any type of texture it is not going to work as well. I have vinyl flooring and the device while working well does not pull up spots in many areas and I attribute that to the texture of the floor because on my tile it works incredible. My tile looks absolutely spotless after I use it. So I do think if you have smooth floors this is perfect for you. I still enjoy it and still use it though on my vinyl but just have to spot clean certain areas. Also beware that while this does have some vacuuming action it is not going to just vacuum up anything. It vacuums up fine dust and even pet hair but if you have a pet that sheds a lot even that can be cumbersome. I do still have to vacuum or sweep prior to using this if I have a lot of pet hair or other larger items otherwise it will clog up the device pretty quickly and you will have a lot of pet hair stuck in the chamber of the dirty water.,
C-Simpson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Total game changer!,the United States,19-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Now that I've been working from home I get to see all the dog hair around the house constantly - so I do the normal routine: sweep, mop and then get down on my hands and knees and wipe up the obligatory left-over dog hair that I missed when I mopped. I HATED doing it this way but never could find a product that could really change that process. Yes, I've tried vacuuming, but again, I would inevitably miss some and end up pushing it around when I mopped. Lo and behold - a vacuum mop! I heard of this machine and had to look into it - there are other ones out there for sure, though not many - but I heart my Tineco! It's super easy to use and I think the best feature is actually that when you need to remove the roller brush to clean it, you simply pop the top off over that area- there's no fussing with trying to flip the whole machine over. I've used it a few times and now I never miss anything and I'm no longer bending down at all! My floors are way cleaner simply because it's such an easy process.",
Brigid S,4.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs great but not on uneven floors,the United States,21-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"It‚Äôs similar to like the swiffer wetjet in my opinion. First off I guess I have a bunch of sand in my house (sheet rock in my basement but I wasn‚Äôt using it on that floor). I have an old house, my floor is uneven and this doesn‚Äôt do well on uneven surfaces. I found myself needing to go over parts again. Also I REALLY wanted this to work on muddy paws on my floor... it barely cleans it up üò≠ I don‚Äôt have to mop as often but I am not able to completely toss my mop because of the uneven floor.Easy to take a part and clean and it is very light which is where I am happy.

It took a few weeks to receive a replacement and guess what....the same exact problem with the replacement unit. Amazon was great and is accepting it as a return for a full refund.

Savannah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life and back saver!,the United States,22-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This has been life changing for me... I have 2 small dogs and 3 cats with all hardwood floors in my home. Although my pets are as tidy as pets could possibly be, there is still fur and dirty paws on my floors daily. This has saved my back from my daily mopping routine because I was doing it by hand. I have used other products but most seemed to just push the hair around so I would mop in one direction scooping up leftover fur after brooming all by hand. The only thing to note is that this is a smaller sweeper which I dont mind and plan to purchase the upgrade model in the future. For now, this is wonderful and machine cleanup is somewhat satisfying. Someone with very large rooms might find this a bit small for a full room clean but it would still be great for spots and high traffic areas. Its so easy that I dont mind to take my time while cleaning. My floors even look cleaner and seem to stay cleaner between full moppings every other day. I would definitely purchase again and have recommended it to everyone. I have not tried it on any thick spills and actually don't plan to. This has really proved itself otherwise.",One

Morgan H,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for light cleans and upkeep,the United States,9-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Definitely not a super deep clean, but if you keep up with using this on your floors regularly it does a great job. I'd reccomend deep cleaning with a regular mop first, and then using this to keep it up daily or weekly. We have laminate floors- It'll remove spots and stuff after a few passes, not the first try. Suction power is good, not fantastic, but you should sweep before using this anyways! The solution it comes with works great, and leaves a pleasant, light smell. The parts are SUPER easy to clean too, which I absolutely love. It was worth the money in my opinion and for our household situation.

I feel like it‚Äôs a toy and I‚Äôm going to break it, to me if feels cheaply made . However it took me some time to get use to it. Never had a wet mop vacuum. You need to move SLOW . Not use to that . Not like a vacuum need small and slow movement and it takes a lot of time . Almost made me wanted to mop my floor and get it over with. However the results after I vacuum and swifter than use the tineco I was amazed! So I will use this more and more . The video is after I vacuum and swifter and how much came out was so exciting. The best part was self cleaning but not all the way . You still have to take it apart and clean after the self cleaning .",
samanthaxrandom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic for price point!!,the United States,28-Feb-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Love this thing. I was wanting a crosswave but that pricetag...so I found this instead. Very sleek, easy to put together, cordless!! Of course nothing mops as great as a steam mop, but for in-between deep cleans or everyday pick up this is perfect!! Love that it cuts out half the work of sweep/vacuuming my hard floors THEN mopping. It can also vacuum over low rugs/carpets. If you release the trigger it will vacuum without the mopping solution. Has a ""spot"" mode for a boost in power.  It also comes with a cleaning brush tool, a tray for it to sit on & dry so it won't drip onto your floors. Very easy to take apart after using and clean it. (definitely clean it out after using it!) Also comes with a bottle of cleaning solution. I've used it twice and the charge lasts the whole time. Will update if anything goes wrong.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price it‚Äôs a good product,the United States,15-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The cordless feature is very nice. You should vacuum first So it doesn‚Äôt clog so easy. You can tell when it clogs because it doesn‚Äôt clean up the water. Cleaning it when finished if done properly is quite time consuming. you have to be sure The battery is charged completely before starting. I thought I charged mine good before I tried it the first time but I did run out of battery before I finished, that was a little disappointing. I think the next time I use it it will go better because I‚Äôll know what to watch for.If possible I will do another review after using it again.

Ashley Kelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Money well spent,the United States,1-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have had this for a few days now and use it all the time. It‚Äôs easy to use and really easy to clean which is great. I have floor boards and it works well on them. I do however find if the floors are uneven (we have a spot that it bumpy and not smooth) or if you go over textured or rough tiles the detergent and water doesn‚Äôt distribute or suck up well and pools in spots. However on a smooth surface which is the majority of my floor space it works well. It‚Äôs better on fresh spills and marks than sticky or dried spills which I feel is to be expected. A downside is that it doesn‚Äôt turn well to get into corners and it tends to miss those little bits that settle along the sideboards and right in those corners. I‚Äôve had handheld stick vacuums in the past and this doesn‚Äôt move as well when turning as those have. However for the price and purpose of cleaning up fresh spills after the children have eaten it‚Äôs money well spent and I‚Äôm really happy with it.,
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong suction, great price, lightweight",the United States,10-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this because of TicToc and am not disappointed! It's far better than the bissell and much cheaper ( I bought this for$160).I have a long haired cat and god does she shed! This thing sucks it all up and mops without hesitation. It even comes with a tool to help cut out hair from the bristles.For mopping, you can use just water, add the cleaning solution, or make your own concoction. I know some people who use a mixture of water and alcohol because of covid!The battery life is a little short, only lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. I have to charge it once if I'm cleaning my entire apartment, which is about 800 square feet, all hard wood. Probably could clean my apartment in one charge, but I like to be really thorough and take my time.",
Colter,3.0 out of 5 stars,Be sure to pull pieces apart to completely dry,the United States,2-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Definitely not for deep cleaning, it needs to be for quick, not dry spills. I love this so much because it makes my life easier with messy toddlers. It does not clean along the sides of the wall or baseboards well, you can almost see a line or where the floor is dirty because this vacuum mop can‚Äôt reach it. So even though mopping would still be necessary, this is worth the purchase to save the hassle of mopping daily with messy kids throwing food on then ground at every meal. My only true complaint is that the water storage is very small. I am constantly refilling it within 1 usage. I love that is self cleans, but remember to take it apart to thoroughly dry or else you will get mold from the moisture left behind. Even after it ‚Äúself cleans‚Äù. I learned this the hard way.

Breanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Is this witchcraft?!,the United States,23-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"You guys your first round around your house is so disturbingly gross what it sucks up AND WE USED A MOP REGUARLY! If you are on the fence about buying this know its life changing. Like the Tineco is worth its weight in gold! I spent weeks doing research regarding Tineco and the competitor. There is no smell form the Tineco other than your house smelling like a fresh AF spa of the God's. I hate mopping and sweeping, I actually get excited to use this! I am forever a fan and customer!",
Daniela Craig,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,the United States,14-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,After reading all the wonderful reviews I wanted one. But I have to say I am very disappointed. It does not really clean my floors. You have to go over spots a thousand times for it to do something. All the dog hair gets stuck in there and it is really gross to clean. Just not what I expected. You are better off with a traditional mop and vacuum.,One
Carmen Soranno,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Must buy, especially for parents of humans or pets",the United States,11-Jan-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I originally ordered this product when it said it would be in stock soon and was shipped much quicker than expected. Unfortunately my first tineco came defective where it was leaking water, spray button didn‚Äôt work, and the self-clean didn‚Äôt work. It was quickly replaced painlessly and my second model came in perfect condition. Works wonderful for my house with hardwood floors and 4 furry dogs. Sucks up hair and cleans simultaneously. My floors have never been cleaner and it‚Äôs a breeze for the daily muddy paw prints Ohio weather causes. Charges quickly and have yet to have it die on me mid use (house is ~1700 sq. Ft.). Super lightweight, easy to clean and maintain.",
Jackie S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Expected Better but still good,the United States,11-May-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I bought this because of all of the reviews of it on TikTok. I like that you can use both modes but understanding exactly how the water comes out is a little confusing.  If you are using this on a floor that is like a fake stone pattern it is hard to see when/if your floors are getting wet at all.  I may upgrade and trade the newer models because I wasn't super impressed with this model but it still works decent.,One
CV,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to remove roller cover,the United States,1-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I love the way this vacuums and mops my floors all in one unit. I also like the self cleaning roller feature. However, I put off using my vac mop because it is so hard to remove the roller brush cover to clean the roller area after using it. This is a serious design flaw. It should not be that hard to remove a cover! Especially since the directions say to remove the roller between uses to let it dry out.",
Ri How,2.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum is good- wet part not so good,the United States,23-Jul-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It‚Äôs a nice vacuum. I only wish the wet part cleaned better. I had to go over an area several times and it still wasn‚Äôt clean. That was the main reason I got it. Frustrating.The hair kept getting stuck in the bottom so I had to keep stopping to clean itI just bought a less expensive vacuum and will use a swifter on the hard wood floors,
Rebecca Wheeler,5.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend this machine!,the United States,8-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is amazing! I was so excited to use this product since I have two cats, 3 kids and a hard working husband who tend to forget to take shoes off or at least stop tracking in dirt. My cats shed really bad. My first time using this machine I was sold! Make sure and charge for at least 3 hours prior to using. It‚Äôs very simple to use and does a great job.",
Heather,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great at first but then stopped working and leaks,the United States,3-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was thrilled with this when I first got it.  Fast forward a year later and I regret it.  It often gets clogged with hair and my small dog has short hair and minimal shedding.  It leaks all over the floor while using.  Now the red light is blinking often and I can't figure out why. I've cleaned it after each use and use once a week.  Disappointed,
Jazmine zam,4.0 out of 5 stars,She do her thang,the United States,9-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this fabulous looking vacuum because it looked like it swept and mopped at the same time and omg... it actually kinda works!!! Anyone else would say it‚Äôs witch craft, but not I, a believer of science and technology. The suction could be a little better if I do say so myself and perhaps maybe adding tubular wand suction noodles on the side of itwould be nice for hard to reach places. Other than that I‚Äôd really like to hype up this suck machine because I have two dogs and they constantly bring mud in from coming in and out and this Ifloor vacuum thing was perfect for that!!! I also use it every day on my hardwood floors and it picks up all the dog hairs too.. honestly if you have pets, you should get it. This vacuum really be doing her thang out here.",

Mindy,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE,the United States,1-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,LOVE this vacuum!! I purposefully did not mop my tile floors for the week I waited for this to be delivered. It did not disappoint. I vacuumed the dry things then started the wet mop feature. So effortless and very effective at getting up week old sticky messes my boys left behind. I use this twice a week for regular cleaning and I get my whole downstairs done on one charge. I refuse to go back to a mop or anything else. Fantastic purchase and will absolutely continue to use products from Tineco.,
Kaye,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great iFloor! Love it!,the United States,11-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I have been using my new iFloor over 3 weeks, and I really love the Cordless and Light weight vacuum cleanser!  I don‚Äôt need to sweeping and mopping anymore. Being a mother of a toddler boy, cleansing is not a daunting thing with the iFloor!  And the cleansers smells fresh and clean and dry fast!",
Amanda Gonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Suction power lightweight.,the United States,24-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Purchased this based on reviews and YouTube videos I‚Äôve researched. I will say it‚Äôs a great product for the money. The vacuum was well packaged and included all parts as listed. Easy to mount on the wall inside my closet.It is so lightweight and easy to maneuver. Very easy to clean out, which is important, because you will clean out often since this thing picks up everything! The suction is strong.  Very easy to empty, charge, etc. Im super happy with this product.",
Abby Orta,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would marry it if I could!,the United States,2-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Best invention ever! This thing right here has my heart and soul! Cleans awesome, it is quiet and the cleaning solution that  it comes with smells like dreams and happiness. It is very easy to use and to clean. I have proposed to it but I think I should get a divorce first. Cleaning the floors have never been this easy.",
Jana Crow,5.0 out of 5 stars,worth the money,the United States,22-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Fantastic item. For such a good suction it has a fairly light motor. Normally you get good suction like this from a Henry but have to out up with lugging it behind you in the house. With this you get the best of both world. The suction is amazing and I don't think just in comparison to my previous hoovers. I'm actually embarrassed at how much dust it collected on the first go but even with subsequent uses, there is a lot of dust and hair collected. It's also really easy to release the dust compartment too. Excellent product,does what it says!",
sadie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,12-Jun-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is so awesome! Especially for the price. I‚Äôm sure you could find a better (and more expensive) one but I‚Äôm happy with this one! The only downside, is it doesn‚Äôt get the corners very closely. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great product! I even love the cleaning solution. I‚Äôm very sensitive to harsh and smelly chemicals but this one is very good!",
Samantha,1.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,the United States,25-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I was very excited because I have a toddler that makes daily floor messes. It doesn‚Äôt handle heavy cleaning areas well at all. It has a very small water tank. And the machine needs to be completely dissembled and cleaned out with everything use. My steam mop is way more convenient,
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its alright.,the United States,23-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Ok, in my experience with this item. It works well, and gets the job done. Way more effective than using  a spin mop for sure! but, I have to empty the tank after each room, cause it tends to loss suction when the metal filter lifts up to much hair, also you have to make more trips to refill the battery lasts about 35 min. You have to charge the manually vs the new ones are charged at the base. If I could, I would have splurged on the new version.  Hope this helps.",
Tarron Woods,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am so glad I saw this on Tik Tok!,the United States,25-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Loved this product. The worst part is dumping the grossness that comes out of the tank, and keeping all of the elements clean, so from that standpoint, it is a bit tedious. Other than that, it cleans my floors wonderfully. O even ran a swiffer with a little pine sol on it afterwards, to see if there was any dirt left, and it was surprisingly clean! I would absolutely recommend. Just make sure to charge and dump as instructed!",One
Marcia Clarke,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stop working,the United States,12-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"So upset, only used this for a few months and now it just won‚Äôt turn on.

Brooke Schwalm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,27-May-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I honestly love it. I've owned 2 bissell croaswaves that broke within months so I opted to buy this instead. So far it works just as well. Fingers crossed it doesn't break. The water tank after using it is disgusting which means it's working!!! Overall very pleased. I will update if it breaks down like the croaswave,
Kaytlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tineco,the United States,15-Feb-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for Christmas and love it! All my floors are wood & it's a two story house so there is plenty of floor cleaning happening. The only thing I dislike is it doesn't get close to the edge and/or baseboards like I would like. I did have to replace the mop roller after a month due to smell. Even after cleaning it every use, it still gained a mildewy smell.",
Michelle Kirby,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE!,the United States,28-Sep-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This thing is so incredibly easy to use!

It is the best vacuum/hardwood cleaner I've ever bought. Def worth the 179.99 if you can still find it for this price. They are selling out for a reason!!! I have a dog and two cats and I have never seen so much hair that I have missed that this thing picks up. Plus it self cleans!!",

sophied ,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS.,the United States,10-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This product did not work well. I used it a few times and cleaned it like instructed and instantly it had an awful smell to it! No ammount of bleach, taking it apart and scrubbing the crap out of it would take the mildew smell away. Couldn‚Äôt use it after that. Total waste of money.",
victoria greg,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for money,the United States,2-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"the vacuum portion works great, when you are done 'mopping' it does leave a small line of residue  under where you turn it off at, which doesn't bother me much, just take a paper towel and your good. This nit made for dried juice and such. Its more cleaning up immediate spilled and daily maintenance. Great value for the money though. We like it.",
N. Kazee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great so far,the United States,3-Aug-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This is gonna be a huge lifesaver / backsaver/ timesaver!!! Hopefully I can get several years outta it before I have to purchase another.Will update if machine fails.,

Brett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,12-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This piece of equipment is lightweight and at the same time heavy at the bottom. This is important to make sure there is weight for the brissels to clean the floor. It did really well against our Luxury vinyl floors. The suction is very powerful. I had to extra coat the floor with water (using a spray bottle) to really let the bristles attack the dirt. It is a good thing, but I would like it to have a stronger water flow when pressing the trigger.Cordless is a life saver! Great product!",One
joi palmeri ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good little mop,the United States,18-Oct-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"I picked this up for my mom because her previous steamer broke. We like that it's easy to fill, this new model is better than the older ones as you can remove the tank to bring it to your sink. It's also lightweight and easy to maneuver, and has a long cord. You can't put essential oil in the water tank, so we put oil onto the mop pad for an extra boost of freshness.",

Tania Garcia,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as I thought,the United States,20-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I will just say I thought this would be a buy I wouldn‚Äôt regret but it wasn‚Äôt.

kate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny so far.,the United States,28-Oct-20,iFLOOR,,"Foster mom here. I have up to 9 kids at a time. 0-13 years old. My floors constantly need to be cleaned. This its AMAZING. completely worth the money.  We actually play egg toss in out house (I know is a mess but kids love it)  we use this to clean up the mess. And it is sucks it up and with the self cleaning I can believe how easy it is now. You do still have to manual clean it also. Remove the beater head and stick something in the hole(lol) to make sure the big debris get removed so it doesnt smell.  The only think I don't like is, a lot of the dog hair get stuck on the screen and I have to stop more often than I would hope. But for how well it cleans its amazing.",

windy williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such ease,the United States,13-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I love the idea of sweeping and mopping at the same time.,
Mike,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,8-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is not worth 270 $. It only has a battery life of 15 minutes,maby!! I couldn't even get one room cleaned before it died! It's not worth 20 dollars. It's only good to clean up a small spill and nothing else! It doesn't clean very well. It doesn't get the edges like up against the walls or toilet, it has an inch gap it can never clean . What can you clean in 15 minutes? Nothing but a small spill so if you wanna waste that kind of money on something you could just wipe up with a paper towel then go ahead . I would be embarrased if I were selling this. Don't waste your money people, not on this anyway.",
Allexis Desmarais,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for people with pets!!,the United States,14-Sep-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,I have had my IFLOOR vacuum for over a year now and I am still in love with it! I have 2 dogs and a toddler so keeping a clean floor is not always easy but this makes it a lot easier. I love how easy it is to keep it clean as well. I recommend this vacuum to anyone looking for a simple way to keep up with crazy dogs or kids messes.,

Kaylee,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so great,the United States,29-Oct-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"The tineco is nice in terms of it being cordless and mopping HOWEVER, it DOES NOT get dog hair. The dog hair clumps up and drags around the floor. If their is a mark on the floor it is most likely not to come up with this. I‚Äôve tried using spot mode and little spots that come off with a Clorox wipe is almost impossible for this thing to clean. I wish I honestly could return but already threw the packaging away. Kind of disappointed :(",
Nicole mcclam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase,the United States,6-Nov-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,Always felt like mopping just pushes dirty water around.I can see that it‚Äôs sucking up the dirt give peace of mind that the floor is actually clean,
Tiffany Milliano,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON‚ÄôT BUY. Wasted our money. GET A CROSSWAVE.,the United States,13-Jun-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"After having this for awhile, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with it. I watched a bunch a videos showing how it was better than the crosswave. But my floors are still dirty after use. For example, look at the picture. I dropped egg on the floor. Wipes it a little with a wet paper towel, thought it would be no big deal, but the tineco didn‚Äôt even clean that!!! I will slowly run it over the same spot, but if I take a rag to the spot afterwards it comes up dirty. Bought this to have clean floors for my baby to crawl around on. But I cannot let my baby crawl on my floors after using it. I even do them everyday. Also, it is such a pain in the butt to have to wash everything after every use. I find myself just getting down on my hands and knees and washing the floors because it takes just as long and the floors actually come out clean. And I can do that every other day instead. Save your money by not buying this or save your money up and buy the Bissell Crosswave.Update: Tineco contacted me via email and said they would refund me. However, they kept referring me to their website that I could never figure out where it was they were telling me to go on there. I kept asking for directions and not getting accurate replies. THEN they emailed me saying ‚Äúthey were happy to resolve my issue‚Äù, when they had NOT. And now I‚Äôm not disappointed, but angry. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT OR COMPANY. GET A CROSSWAVE INSTEAD.",
adutt,1.0 out of 5 stars,Updated....garbage. Read review save your $$$,the United States,26-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Just arrived this week. I love the concept, and when it works correctly its a dream. However, it randomly stops application of solution and water even when tank is full. I often have to turn it off and back on for solution to come out. I love the convenience and it does a great job, but this flaw is frustrating. I tried thoroughly cleaning the unit to see if that helped, but it made no difference. I'll review again in another week. I may have to return sadly.UPDATE:I unfortunately could not return. Now the compartment to put cleaner in is broken. The spring and little stopper came right off. Theres no way to open this and put them back into place. DO NOT BUY THIS!! GARBAGE!!",
Customer ,1.0 out of 5 stars,BAD PRODUCT don‚Äôt listen to tiktok,the United States,25-Mar-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"Weak suction, doesn‚Äôt get corners, dirt shoots out the back randomly spot cleaning doesn‚Äôt work, water spills. Last time I order anything off a tiktok review. Returning was a hassle because once the handle is assembled into the vac it will not come back apart and will not fit into the original box it came in. UPS wanted a$25 packing fee and Amazon wasn‚Äôt very understanding of my frustration of being a prime member and having to deal w this BS. Also it‚Äôs a lot easier to use a mop. A lot less cleaning. Doesn‚Äôt save time. It‚Äôs annoying to take apart and clean.",
AL PM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this thing.,the United States,6-Nov-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"My kids are cleaning floors. I am cleaning floors.  The dogs make messes, we clean it up.  So easy.  I have a bona system and scrubbies and all manner of fancy microfiber cloths and sweidh death cleaning sponges and sprays galore.  I have a robot vacuum that rarely finished the house.  But this?  Wonderful. Cordless.  This lil puppy sweeps and mops and makes my house less pet smelly.",
Tiffany G,2.0 out of 5 stars,not worth the money,the United States,28-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,It only worked for about a month and we didn't use it for anything major.

Scott,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised but there is a tradeoff.,the United States,24-Apr-21,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,This combo vacuum/mop device works as advertised and does a good job.  But cleaning the device after use involves more effort than wringing a mop and dumping the bucket.  Depending on your situation you may (or may not) prefer traditional vacuuming/mopping.,

heather s,4.0 out of 5 stars,it does what it says it will,the United States,2-Dec-20,iFLOOR,Verified Purchase,"so i bought this after seeing 100's of videos on tik tok of this being the greatest thing since sliced bread. I read tons of reviews on multiple sites and watched videos to compare this with other products. After i received it i instantly put it together and tried it out. The floor was cleaner yes, but i guess i was expecting more. so i did the whole house, again was expecting more but not terrible. the pain is you have to clean it after every use. in my head i was thinking cool, it cleans itself which was one of the biggest sellers for me. But after every use you have to put it on the tray, have it do its clean, then take it all apart and rinse and clean it yourself. none the less, the water i started with is clean and i empty dirty nasty water so it works.",One
