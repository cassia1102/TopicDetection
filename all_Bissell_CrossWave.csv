Cherish Vuyovich,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't get these bad reviews,the United States,21-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am in the process of purchasing this for our business, as I've owned a Bissell Crosswave for almost 2 years. And honestly, I have to put to rest some of these issues people are complaining about. I LOVE my Crosswave. I have a house that is nothing but tile, 2800 sq ft, and let me tell you, I couldn't live without it. I have noticed a couple of things that would produce some of the issues people complain about, but its not the fault of the crosswave.The streaky floor thing, people, if you're getting streaky floors...you're floor is super dirty. Yes. It is. Stop blaming the mop. If you swiffer...then yuck. All you're doing with a swiffer is pushing dirt around and letting it harden on your floor. So nasty.  You need to clean your floors, rinse the brush, and clean your floor again if you are one of the people getting streaks when you clean. Yes. I have only had this on a few occasions where a I had to clean a mess up. Usually powdery messes will cause this. And I did have streaky floors. But I went over it a couple of times and it finally all came up. If you have severely dirty floors, a dusty house, a lot of dirt, etc...yes...it's going to take a quite a few cleanings to pull up the mess that has solidified itself to your floor. Duh. I have 3 dogs and 2 cats, 4 children and plants galore. Guess what? No streaky floors. I also clean my brushes regularly and after every session, I clean and rinse out the entire base which only takes a couple of minutes. The cleaning solution that you buy for it has worked really well, and also does a good job on a few of the rugs I have. When I first bought this, the water that I would dump from the bin was black...pure black. Now it's a nice light gray. And it has stayed that way. Honestly, I don't have any issues with this mop. If I had to be picky, I wish the dirty water tank held more...but then my whole house is tile so I understand that not everyone has the same situation.Bottom line is, there is not a single product out there that doesn't have bad reviews. I've read most of these and really believe it is lack of knowledge. Whether its the condition of the home contributing to the results or even not knowing that each item does need to be securely placed in the mop, and cleaned after every session. I've bought one of these for my mom and sister, and both have fallen in love with the Crosswave. I also make sure to replace the filter every few months and have bought extra roller brushes so that when I've used one, I can throw it in the washing machine (cold, no bleach, no fabric softner, and air dry). So, I just really believe that if you take care of it, it will continue to produce great results. If you like mopping and only have a small area to clean, then this may not be for you. I can see where this would be a bit pricey for those in that category. But if you have pets, kids and do enough mopping that you dislike doing it, then I seriously encourage you to try this one out. Life changing!","2,372"
Deb Riester,1.0 out of 5 stars,FATAL design flaw.,the United States,5-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Excellent idea. Worked fantastic on my polished floors. Built well. Well engineered. Was very happy for two months (about 15 hours of use over 60 days.)Has a FATAL flaw. The ball bearings on the impeller side of the motor are very susceptible to moisture damage. These bearings are not accessible for service or replacement (not an environmentally friendly situation) resulting in a hardly broken in $275.00 machine that will be headed to the junk yard. Yes I could have sent it back under warranty but here is the deal:I am a professional repairman by trade. The motor assembly is now junk because it can not be repaired (by design) , even by a professional. The complex and powerful motor unit is made of a very easy to break plastic that appears similar to Bakelite a thermo-setting phenol formaldehyde resin, formed from a condensation reaction of phenol with formaldehyde,"" if it is Bakelite -again not environmentally friendly.""After  finding the problem with my unit I quickly retracted my kudos to my friends and family about the unit. I am left with a pile of useless parts and not determined to repair this unit because the first bearing was destroyed with moisture in only 60 days.Wish the motor design were better. Could have lasted years in my opinion because it is well built. My suggestion - don't buy.I would be surprised if the repair / return center isn't full of these machines needing of motors.If Bissell reads this, feel free to contact me for details. Unless I hear of a product improvement involving the heart of this machine I will not buy another unit and will continue to warn friends not to waste money.","6,346"
Jackie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves dirty streaks,the United States,23-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I saved up money and was super excited to order the crosswave. I have three pets and the thought of not having to sweep up before vacuuming was a dream to me! After having this product for a couple weeks now I can say the only thing positive about it is that it does do a good job vacuuming. Other than that it's all downhill. It really doesn't get a deep clean like I've seen on other steamers. It leaves dirty streaks all over even after going over the spot several times. If you have any kind of ledge say from kitchen to living room, it does a horrible job picking up dirt around it. Stuck on dirt? Expect to stand there for at least a minute putting some serious elbow grease into getting it out. When you're done expect another 10 minutes at least taking apart and cleaning the machine after each use. Hair gets all up in there and not just in the tank. I have to go over it with Clorox wipes to get all the hair out. I feel extremely let down, especially with the high cost of this. See photos for streaks and dirt it was unable to pick up near a small ledge","1,110"
Mary,1.0 out of 5 stars,It leaves streaks and doesn’t seem like the scrub brush part even works,the United States,16-Feb-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Wish i wouldn’t of purchased this floor cleaner.

Nicole Becerra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review and tips included,the United States,7-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Okay so I waited a couple of months to try this and then do a review I have to say this machine is awesome! I live in a fully tiled house in the desert with 6 big dogs. I clean about 2x a week and I've used this on carpet in our house too. The only problem I have is the solution you can buy from bissell I go through fast so I decided to try the Mr. Clean concentrated and all I do is two drops into the whole bottle of water. For the filter after I clean the house I rinse off the debris and soak it in water with dawn dish soap overnight then rinse and let air dry and no more smell to it and it looks brand new.,"2,619"
sjws,1.0 out of 5 stars,I loved the CrossWave and used it quite a bit for ...,the United States,11-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I loved the CrossWave and used it quite a bit for quick cleanups between deep cleanings.  It was easy and convenient to use and cleaned well.  Now, 6 months after I purchased it, it is not spraying cleaning solution onto the floor.  I followed all of the troubleshooting directions that Bissell provided and it is still not working.  It's not worth the hassle of packing it up and sending it back.  I considered this to be a long-term investment but am disappointed.  Buyer beware.",767
Brian,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dirt collects on the bottom as you clean. Once you use cleaner it turns to mud, and leaves muddy water streaks on the floor.",the United States,30-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We have a new home w hard-wood floors and rugs.  Thought we could clean them both with this.  The problem is, as you clean the bottom collects dirt off the floor due to the static charges in the low-humidity environment here in Colorado.  Once you spray the cleaner the dirt gets wet and turns into mud on the bottom side of the unit.  As you clean, the mud is wiped back onto the floor.  This leaves streaks of muddy water that we had to wipe up by hand on our hands and knees. Sold it on Craigs list.  Very disappointing!",470

Laurie J. Mattson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, very good. Tips for those with animals that don't want to pay for the Pet Pro model:",the United States,28-Nov-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have two cats (one long haired) and one XL dog (VERY long hair) so I have to deal with A LOT of shedding. And, I'm honestly not the best at keeping up with vacuuming and *certainly* not the best with keeping up with mopping. I'm always looking for ways to make the process of keeping my floors clean easier and more streamlined.So, I did a bit of research to decide if I should buy this model or the Pet Pro model, which is almost $150 more than this one. There is a youtube video out there that explains the differences better than I can, but basically they have the same motor and power capabilities. The key differences are the following: the brush roll and the strainer, which separates the liquids from solids (like pet hair) in the waste tank.  -The strainer is ONLY included in the Pet Pro.  -The brush rolls are different between the two models. The Pet Pro brush roll is designed to deal with excess  amounts of pet hair and this model's is notOther than that, it seems like they're the same.I also found out before purchasing this model that you can change out the brush on this model and buy the one separately that's made for the Pet Pro. So, I bought this brush roll: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B3CDZGB/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1First, I tested out the regular brush roll on a rug and a small area of hardwood in my living room. I was impressed by how much it picked up on the first run, especially because I did not vacuum anything beforehand, and my rug was looking like it could double as another pet with all the pet hair all over it.BUT. When I checked the tank and the brush roll, I was not impressed. The standard brush roll was covered/tangled in hair. The waste tank was full of hair and it had clogged up. Easy to clean (relatively), but after only using it for less than one minute, I wasn't impressed.I then switched to the pet pro brush roll, which was a perfect fit. While I had already cleaned the rug, which I'm sure had the most hair, with the standard brush, I did go over the rest of my apartment. I saw very little, if any, tangled hair around this brush, where the previous one was completely covered. The tank also did not get clogged up.As for the sifter...I don't personally think it's needed, especially for such a huge price difference. There is a section attached to the top of the tank you can easily use to strain the waste on your own. I strained the liquids into the toilet until very little liquid was left, then dumped the rest (mostly hair) into the trash.I will say that another con is that it goes through quite a bit of cleaning solution, very quickly. You fill most of the tank with water, but also need to add solution as well. I was down to half a tank cleaning my small apartment. I haven't done specific research on other cleaning solutions to purchase, but I know that, while Bissell says otherwise, most buyers have been buying and successfully using better and cheaper solutions with both models.Not a deal breaker for me, but I also noticed that wet pet hair clumps on the ground occasionally, and I did need to go back over at the end to pick them up. Also, it does leak a bit when in the upright position, as to be expected.SO in conclusion: If you have pets and deal with a lot of pet hair, I would recommend purchasing this model (saving money), but buying the Pet Pro brush to replace the standard one that comes with this one. If I had not done this, I would have given it a much lower rating. If you don't have pets, this model would work fine for you regardless of the brush.",137
Kathleen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love It, but I’m disgusted that my supposedly clean floors were so filthy…",the United States,23-Mar-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My Crosswave just arrived today and I was on my way out but decided to stay home as I was excited to try it out. We have a large area consisting mostly of wood but have some tile and marble areas. What a breeze it was not having to use different cleaning products and mops and I could just go right through the house on different surfaces without even vacuuming.I’ve used Bona on my hardwood for years and although it looked pretty good I know it wasn’t clean. The bottoms of my feet attested to that. I’ve also used a Hoover Floormate about once a month and although it did clean the floor more than just spraying and spreading Bona around weekly, it just seemed to put too much water out on the hardwood.I LOVE the results I got today. You can see the water does go on the floor, but it’s suctioned up well and dries so quickly. I even used it on the Marble and it looks fantastic. No streaks with the Multi surface cleaner and it feels clean. My ceramic floors in the Bathrooms are very textured and pitted and they look so much cleaner. I even tried it on a couple of area carpets and it worked great. (Not for deep cleaning though)Now the disgusting part – The dirty water reservoir! It’s hard to believe there was so much dirt on my floors. Yikes! The unit is also very easy to use, gets close to baseboards, swivels to get under things and is light. Wish the cord was positioned better but that’s easily remedied by attaching it to the holder. I’m hoping this is going to be the answer to a clean house and feet! Haha. So far I’m super impressed!","1,177"
M. Gondek,3.0 out of 5 stars,Handy for quick-ish cleanings,the United States,27-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"), which has spoiled me with its excellent attachments, headlight, and lift-away handle that lets me get under everything in my house. This vacuum has none of that, so it's a ""quick-fix"" cleaner, at best. If I want to do a more thorough job, I'll have to pull out the Shark and follow-up with mopping with something else (maybe this, maybe a mop).Overall, I'd love to see Bissell improve this cleaner enough to mean I really don't need a separate vacuum. But for now, it's just a handy tool for a quick-ish cleaning.Edit to add:I've been using this regularly for a while now, and have three observations:1. I only use it for washing the floors. I still pull out a regular vacuum for the area rugs, and to use the attachments for more thorough cleaning because of this unit's limitations.2. I've also noticed that the filter and brush take 2-3 days to dry, even in my very arid climate. So plan to leave this disassembled for at least that long, or you'll get a nasty, musty smell from it when you use it.3. You also can't clean the floors right up the edge, leaving a 3/4"" unwashed edge around the floors. I'll probably want to pull out the Bona mop from time to time to get right up to the wall. If you're sucking up a spill, this might be more of an issue.","2,699"

Amberia Pankonien,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life [Clean] Changer,the United States,16-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love this machine. Let me repeat, I LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!! I bought mine a little under a year ago and have used it almost weekly. It cleans my wood-laminate floors WONDERFULLY.GET THIS: you’re sweeping AND mopping at the same time. Who wants to sweep, and then go back over the same areas with the mop!?GET THIS: it sucks up all the icky. I hate when I sweep and just push dust and fur around to find it later in the wetness left behind by the mop. That doesn’t happen with the crosswave, it gets sucked up. All of it. My floors have never been this clean.I find it best to use way less of the cleaning solution and more water. What!? I do use Bissell’s multi surface cleaning product, but it lasts forever because I use like 1/4 of the suggested measurement and it makes my floors perfectly clean (no streaks) and still smells great!This is my FAVORITE cleaning tool. Yes, you have to take all the parts out and wash them down, wipe down in the hoses and the bottom of the machine once you’re done, but it saves so much more time than that takes. And my floors are cleaner for it. It was so frustrating to spend so much time sweeping then mopping and then cleaning up from those, just to end up with yuckiness still on my floors after all that effort.OH, and my area rug gets vacuumed and shampooed every time I run the cross wave because it has an area rug setting. Mind Blown yet? (There is a caveat here, my area rug is very low pile, not sure how it would do on a high pile rug).So, basically, this thing changed my life. My daughter eats way less dirt when she eats something off the floor and I have way less stuff getting stuck to my feet. I’m incredibly happy :D",74
Chez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Better deal on Bissell webpage,the United States,1-Feb-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I JUST found this on the Bissell webpage for same amount but you get all the extras with it.Just a heads up for those who are interested in buying it. Why pay $$$, for the extras that come free on the manufacturer page.Now, the product itself is great. I just moped the day it came and decided to use it anyway. It definitely cleaned better. My water was diry. It pulls out all the hair that I didn't see in my wood floor cracks. I was pretty shocked. I would definitely recommend.",105
Leong Ming Jun,1.0 out of 5 stars,Motor was smoking on the first day of use!!!,the United States,21-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've just bought the machine from Amazon. When I first started up the machine and priming the solution, the machine stops working after 5 seconds. I removed the plug from the socket and tried it again, same thing happens. I left the machine aside while searching for troubleshooting info, suddenly the machine was dispensing fluid on its own and the motor started smoking.I received another replacement unit within the week. Guess what? It started off okay for 5 mins. Next day, when I used it again, there was a loud screeching noise and it exploded in a plume of black smoke. As you can see the photos, there was soot and shredded metal within the cavity of the dirty water tank.In addition, the vacuum is VERY loud. It's high pitch noise estimating at 70 decibels!Very very disappointed with Bissell to sell a product without quality checks and testing.",65
MAS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do not hesitate to buy this!,the United States,24-Jun-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I feel a bit funny getting so excited about a floor cleaner— yet it, in under 24 hrs it has become the most prized tool in my arsenal. Ok, here's the deal.I have tile (which means grout, unsealed grout, my biggest cleaning nemesis and OCD antagonizer), hardwood and area rugs in the living areas and berber in the bedrooms. I also have an incontinent dog with lots of choices to eliminate on. For some reason I lucked out, in a molly maid sort of way.  His incontinence is generally active on the tile, which to me is the best of all three in terms of hard surfaces, absorption rate and difficulty of cleaning.  But it also meant scrubbing tiles and rivers of pee flowing in the rough and uneven grout lines. Twice a day, tons of wasted paper towels and tile cleaner and solution to remove the dog urine as I scrub with sore knees and aching back.Packaging was very nondescript. It almost looked like a run-of-the-mill shipping box, and inside was the product. No flashy, full-color glossy box. No excessive packaging, enough to keep it safe. It took me five minutes to unbox, assemble and get to work. Very positive benefit. It is lightweight yet powerful. Surprisingly.  It cleaned the tiles and grout in one minute, the dog stain (that I purposely left– yuck) was gone in under a minute. It would take me at least 15 to 20 minutes to 'manually' clean the dog urine.  And it actually was able to scrub some of the deeper grout lines from a poor tile installation.  That surprised me quite honestly.It's a simple, yet highly effective hard floor cleaner.  It seems sturdy, yet is compact and light, and it comes with its own plastic tray to sit in with an attachment where the roller can also air out to dry.  The cord is very long so it cuts down on stopping, changing to a different outlet, restarting.  I do find it a bit on the pricey side, I think it should be priced at 199, however I'll pay the extra 50, 60 whatever bucks to take away my most hated household chore. We'll see how it holds up, given I will be using it every day, probably twice a day. I'm glad to see you can order replacement rollers.This is easily one of the best floor cleaning products I have purchased in the past 20 years.  Sorry for the somewhat awkward photos, I did want to capture that the buttons on the handle light up, and when you are triggering the solution, the main floor unit also lights up which is nice touch.I no longer get angry with my puppy. I never should have, but when you're on your way out the door to work, late, in corporate blues and have to stop for 20 minutes and clean dog pee, well, now it will only take me one minute without touching any dirty rags, sponges, wasteful paper towels. That's worth it's weight in gold.Oh – another great benefit is that you do not have to sweep your floors beforehand!  No more double cleaning. It both sweeps and scrubs/cleans.I admit I was skeptical and very hesitant to buy any more floor cleaners. I tried steam, the good old manual method, different types of floor cleaners,  grout scrubbers, different types of household chemicals to remove the urine stain and odor that in the end were too much effort, expensive with very little return on investment.",221

Mike H.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really Bissell??? Lacking customer service for a bad machine!,the United States,21-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’m deeply disappointed in these machines and bissells lack of customer service. As you can see I’ve spent quite a bit of money on these machines. I do love the way this machine performs and helps me get through my day in a very timely manner. Saves me so much time cleaning. However, there are some severe design flaws that need to me fixed or bissell needs to step up their customer support. Minus the last crosswave in the video every single one of my crosswaves has failed in the same way! The plastic bearing that powers the brush fails and fails rather quickly. Bissell DOES NOT make a replacement for this part. So, this leaves you $350 machine a piece of junk. All of the machines pictured have failed with in the last three years. The first one was ordered around Christmas time of 2016. Same issue. That’s when we found out Bissell doesn’t make a replacement part. Something needs to give or be resolved because it seems as though this is a very common issue. I was recently in so many words told by Customer service that I could take it to my local repair man and Bissell May cover the cost of the machine could be fixed. I calmly explained that I’ve had this same issue with the last 4 machines and we knew what had failed and there is no fix. In so many worlds I was told I was SOL. Not cool Bissell not cool!

J. Muench,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow my floors have texture to them!!,the United States,15-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have just completed cleaning ALL our LVP (luxury vinyl plank) flooring in the entire house.  This was a multi-tank process, multi-day clean-a-thon as we recently moved into a new-build house.  I could just not see myself on hands and knees washing the floors, or swabbing dirty water around with a mop and bucket; I have thrown my Swiffer WetJet to the curb because it just moved dirt around too (I may have written a pretty hateful review of it btw).  I got myself the Crosswave for my birthday splurge.  Sad I know.  No kids, no pets (maybe someday but not now); we have visiting service dogs though.Here's what I can tell you after using the Crosswave a half a dozen times. on textured wood-grain-look plank vinyl and slate-textured vinyl tiles.  O.  M.  G.  We actually see the texture of the vinyl flooring now!!!  We had this floor installed, and every sub imaginable walked on it or the cardboard protector sections with muddy boots.  The floor was given a cursory cleaning before we moved in with a shop vac, and while it didn't *look* dirty,  it didn't look very clean either.First pass with the Crosswave was a muddy-mucky mess of water in the dirty water tank.  I have to admit some OCD tendencies prompted me to do a few overlapping passes using multiple tanks of water and essentially Crosswaved the entire 1st floor twice in 2 days.  As I cleaned each section, we noticed that the ""wood look"" vinyl actually had more of a textured grain than we thought!  Wow, and it actually looks clean now, with brighter colors!!  Same thing with the bathrooms with the slate-look vinyl--wow! texture!  And it's more colorful than we thought!!I was afraid that this would be one of those ""EWWW I have too much to clean!"" appliances and I would use it a couple times, take the thing all apart, have to scrub and scrub all the parts I just took apart, and it would end up staying in pieces here, there, and everywhere, and one piece would get separated in the scramble for company coming over, and end up in pieces in the garage or something.  NO!!  Easy to clean, easy to dry, easy to put back together or keep all together until the next time.Lessons Learned:1)  I think if we had a shedding pet--in addition to our shedding selves--I would look into the Pet version.  I found that the machine will say the dirty water tank is full with that lovely screech IF there is hair and lint starting to clog it up.  You may not even be halfway through your clean water tank before you have to empty the dirty one.  Sometimes giving the Crosswave a little jiggle to shake the hair/lint/goo free from the float in dirty tank gets you another couple minutes of cleaning.2) The Crosswave is not a quiet device.  Watch a few of the videos of someone using it to clean and you'll see you cannot hold a conversation and run this thing at the same time.  There will be a lot of screaming to make yourself heard.  The screech when the dirty water tank is full is a near-crap-inducing noise.  Every time it comes on I swear that it will start smoking, flames will burst out, and ball bearings will spray around the room; thankfully this does not happen, but I haven't let the screech go on for more than a few seconds.3)  Washing WITH the grain of your floor and going slow and steady is key.  I also start in the far corner, cleaning with the grain, and slowly back out of the area overlapping all the way, hovering over dirtier-looking spots for an extra scrub.  If you get some dribbles or the floor seems too wet, let go of the water trigger and slowly go over the wet area again to let the squeegie and vacuum suck up the excess water.  When I went across the grain of the vinyl I seemed to see the 'tire tracks' when it dried.  Going slow also keeps the streaks down by giving the Crosswave time to suck up the dirty water so you don't have streaks.4)  The sample bottle only gets you 2.5 tanks worth of cleaning.  Buy extra cleaner or have white vinegar on hand.5)  The Crosswave is much easier to clean than I would have guessed, and the best part is...  I have yet to have long hair permanently wound around the scrubbie brush!!!  I have a whole tool kit just for taking apart my vacuum beater brush, and as much as I love my Miele canister vacuum, cleaning the beater brush is not how I like to spend my free time.  So far with the Crosswave, all the hair and lint ends up in the dirty water tank.  I just pop that tank out, pull off the filter off and rinse under warm water, pull the green floater section off, wipe the underside of that with a papertowel and set in sink, slowly dump the icky water into the corner of the kitchen sink so I can swab up the hair-lint-goo with said paper towel, toss paper towel, rinse everything off in hot water.  The brush comes out easily, and brush and its cover get rinsed in the sink and set aside with other parts to dry.  I take one more paper towel and wipe around the dirty water gasket, and the areas around the brush.  It really is easy to clean!Photos:  First pass on new, never-cleaned floor and the icky water.  The brush is soft blue and stiffer red scrubbie bristles.  All the parts drying on the counter.So far I am loving my Crosswave!!",32
BluePanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Disgustingly amazing.,the United States,24-Sep-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Disgustingly amazing. I can't say how much I enjoy using this. You don't really realize how dirty your floor is until you use this. I love not having to vacuum before ""mopping"" and I love not having to actually mop. This thing rocks. We have three levels of floor that really should be mopped frequently between two cats and traffic. This makes my life easy. No vacuum, just use the crosswave. It picks up kitty litter and even cleans cement floors in the basement. The water and things it picks up may make you want to barf, but the results are amazing. I never realized how dirty our floors get until now. A large tank goes a long way the sample cleaner included smells quite alright. The cord is just the right length of long without getting in the way. It does a great job and I haven't touched the mop since it showed up. Poor mop.",136

I call Bissell and they said it sounds like it’s a connection issue and I can bring it in to a repair shot...um no I just paid $250 for a wet vacuum and haven’t even used it once so I’m not going to bring it to a repair shop. Beware if you have any issue you’ll be required to bring it in. I had hoped they would offer to pay to have it shipped but no worries amazon of course will take care of the return. It’s a complete hassle tho. BEWARE may or may not work, find a more reliable machine.",35
nicoleMP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty sure this machine saved my marriage...,the United States,12-Jun-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is amazing. It makes cleaning my floors so easy and convenient. I have a toddler and an infant and dark hard wood floors... not the best combo. But my house has never been cleaner now that I have this vacuum. It is the closest thing to a good hand and knees scrub. My husband and I used to argue so much about the upkeep of our floors dirty floors make everything else look gross. It was just too hard to keep clean. But now we can do the kitchen, dining room, and living room in about 15 minutes. My husband loves using it as well and said it was the best $250 dollars spent for this ""investment."" He is the cheapest man you will ever meet so for him to say this is even more amazing than this vacuum. If you are on the fence about this purchase take the jump and do it.",42
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to bad to love this, but...",the United States,30-May-17,,Verified Purchase,"First I'd like to give a little background I have two children under the age of five & a great Dane dog that's indoors most of the time, I have 1000 square-foot home & it gets messy often. When i saw this product i got very excited thinking 'what a brilliant idea'  but sadly when I tried it I was very disappointed.I bought this product yesterday & came home & used it right away on my hardwood floors & immediately noticed the dog hair was clogging it up after only doing half of my living room I had to clean it out because I was losing suction.  That's when I noticed you can't just dump the container into the trash because it's all wet you have to dig your hand down in it & pull it out to throw it away it's completely disgusting. It also missed all the corners & edges therefore I had to get out my broom to sweep all the corners/edges into the middle of the room to use the crosswave to clean it up.After that fail I decided I would give it another shot & went into my kids room on the area rug to try an clean it, but knowing that it just pushed around the larger items in the living room test I decided to pick those items up off the rug first (large items being gold fish, paper, pop tart crust etc.)  I then used the crosswave to first vacuum the rug going over it two times as it was not picking up the dog hair the way I would've liked, then I mopped it with the crosswave. I'm sad to say I was very disappointed in both the mop & vacuum on the area rug. The rug was still visibly dirty & didn't have that fresh smell the commercial claim. I then went over the rug again with my broom I've always used & was amazed at how much the $230 crosswave left behind. (pictures below) after 4 passes with crosswave, then 1 pass with broomI have found that this product didn't do what it claims & left me very unsatisfied. I feel my broom works better on my rugs/floors & although it's not fun my hand mop is still better then the crosswave truly it can't even compare to either of them.",59
The Consumer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price,the United States,25-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have had this vacuum for just shy (2 days) of a month.  This would be a good vacuum at $100 but not at $249  -My Annoyances- The button for mopping the floor is right where my hand is so while I'm vacuuming I'll  unintentionally hit this button and it'll start to mop the floor.  This is annoying because once the roller is wet using it to vacuum is not going to happen.- After each use I have to clean the vacuum which means emptying out the dust bucket (pretty normal) but also changing out the roller and cleaning out the roller area which is a pain.- The vacuum doesn't suck up as well as it did the first few weeks so the sides close to the wall have to be swept first.,13
Robert Lanois,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaner and shinier.,the United States,11-Feb-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I want to first start out by saying I would give this almost 5 star. Better than 4 but just a bit less than perfect. There is another reviewer that had some great tips, points, criticisms, and high praise as well. I concur with them all the way. I will try to add my points and tips that I hope Bissell reps might see.Our house is very well maintained. We were using with what we felt were ideal result but what we found after using the Bissell CrossWave was that extra step that we missed. Our previous method was a very good canister vacuum and a terry cloth mop 15x8 style. Our floors looked great. Friends always thought our house was just cleaned. The Bissell adds a step in the cleaning by introducing a buffing action to the cleaning. Our floors have a nicer just waxed appearance to them now.  We have not used the cleaner supplied yet. The results we have noticed in two weeks use clearly shows.This does not come without costs though. First the vacuum is heavy and does not move gracefully. Point for Bissell. I haven't looked but you should develop a washable filter for it and not a paper filter if you want to save your customers some money. The screen is good but there will always be some clogging beyond that. If they make reusable air filters for cars  someone can make a smaller version for this gem.Parts do need maintenance and that bring me to some tips. Cleaning is critical. Best time is right after use. Too bad it could not be hosed down. for cleaning. That would make it perfect. A small tip tool for anyone interested. Take a strip of terry cloth rag about 12 inches long and shaped as a point from 1.5 in wide to 0.5 in. poke a small hole in the pointy end and run a zip tie through it and lock it on to act like a needle to help you clean the throat of the cleaner.Another review mentioned it. The cord is shorter than I would like. Newer houses have more plugs and better spaced but older ones lack some. A longer power cord about 10 ft. more would have also better. The cord also comes out at a bad spot on the machine. It will get in the way and should have come out of the handle where your hands are. Tip here for now. Zip tie the cord to the storage loop. In fact there is a small plastic hook that looks ideal for this fix. See attached photo. Also the direction I  have the wire going is better for a left handed person.It is very noisy. It has a high whine noise and it is something that can nearly leave you with ringing in your ears. It does not work for stairs. Bathrooms are always very small so you might not be able to get the head around the toilet as well as other unmovable objects. Does not go under the bed or very far under legged furniture like bureaus.It didn't save us more time but it did add a bit more shine to the floor. It could make you have some changes to your lifestyle by having lighter moving furniture and less clutter on the floor. I can say without a doubt that our floors are cleaner and shinier.UpdatedAfter a few months of using it I have some updates. At first we were using the unit with plain water. This week I decided to use the multi-surface solution. I didn't use as much as is suggested but I did put enough in that I have a better appreciation of the solution. I didn't want to have sticky floor surfaces as someone here said they had. After use my floors had a nicer shine to them. It still doesn't get into tighter places but the places it does get to gets clean. If you have an air compressor you will be cleaning the paper filter after each use, otherwise expect to be buying the filter every month or so.It would be nice if we could do stairs with it but that is impossible. It really could use a wand and hose to get behind and between stuff that the unit itself cannot go. Otherwise I do like the unit. It does save time and does a great job cleaning the floor. Using the solution also added a layer of shine not seen since it was new. All in all I think this has been a good investment.A Final update. I have had this unit for a year and I still love the machine. As someone mentioned I wasn't sure if it could be done you can use water to clean the filter. I have not gone to the same extent as they did with using a cleaning solution for the filter but I do run it under the faucet. I use hot water and run it in the stream both sides. I have two and alternate weekly. I clean my floors once a week but we are a no shoes in the house and no kids left to make a mess.I use the multi surface cleaner but will consider Mr Clean as someone also suggested. I like the shine it puts on the floor the cleaner puts on the floor but I am always looking to save a bit of money. It stays that way all week. It takes less time to clean my floors now that we are using this. I clean the unit after each use and I now use a 12inch square wash cloth with a long zip tie on one of the corners of the rag. This I use to pull the towel through the throat of the machine to clean it for the next use. It works great and my machine has stayed quite clean.Anyway if anyone is considering using this to clean their floors you will not go wrong.Update as someone added to my post the filters are washable.",339
Phredgirlie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amaze-balls,the United States,14-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Holy mother of cleaning! I was hesitant about spending the $250 on it... I figured I may be able to spend less and buy a mop- but I liked that it scrubbed the floors so I decided to go for it.I have 5 kids and my floors are NASTY. Like legit always gross. This thing got them really clean. There was a few spots of stuck on stuff that I had to get by hand but being able to go from tiles to carpet was so awesome.Also... remember my nasty floors, well my toddler smashed banana in my living room rug a few weeks ago and even with wiping it off and spit cleaning it- it still picked up dirt and was a nasty spot. Well guess whose carpet doesn’t have any more banana spots... this mom!Totes worth the $250...Totes worth more than that...In fact just take all my money cause I don’t have to sweep first and I don’t have to get on the floor to scrub my tile.

James Cody Case,2.0 out of 5 stars,Works great—for a month,the United States,18-Mar-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"While it worked, this was a wonderful product! I could sweep and mop my tile floor then, with the push of a button, vacuum and clean my area rugs. I loved it. For a month. Then it started leaking all over the place. I’ve asked for a replacement part and supposedly it’s in the mail—2 week’s ago.  In spite of the leaking I’ve still been using it to mop my floor. However I was just in the middle of mopping when it just stopped. I thought it had come unplugged. Nope. Maybe threw the circuit? Nope. It just died. 3 months in. It’s under warranty so I’ll get a replacement but overall I’m not impressed. A product is only as good as long as it works as it’s supposed to. With this that worth is one month. Too disappointed.**update —Part came but didn’t fix the problem. Since I’ve had it 3 months then it’s not eligible for replacement. I took it in to the repair shop and was told it’ll be 1-3 MONTHS for it to be fixed.  Fingers crossed that I didn’t just flush $250 but my hopes are not high.",20
Kai Roberts,4.0 out of 5 stars,My experience has been mixed,the United States,6-Oct-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was absolutely thrilled with the unit the first time I used it. I keep my floors clean (or so I thought). I vacuum the highly trafficked areas daily and mop the hard floors at least twice a week.  But my goodness!  After using the CrossWave on my hardwood and tile floors, the dirty water tank was disgusting and my floors were a couple of shades brighter.  I couldn't believe it.  However, the second time I pulled this machine out, it functioned at first, then I realized the cleaning spray wasn't coming out very well. I had followed the maintenance instructions completely after the first use and made sure the filters, etc. were all cleaned and that there were no obstructions.  I reassembled the unit as instructed. When the spray function didn't work properly, I went back to the manual (I apparently didn't prime the pump for the full 10 seconds before using).  Though I had found the initial problem, now the machine wouldn't turn back on. Back to the manual I went, and this time, I was instructed to dismantle the unit and check for blockages -- none were found. After fussing over it awhile, I called in the Big Guns and my husband took a crack at the problem. Ultimately we both wasted a fair bit of time before picking up the phone and calling Bissell Customer Support (which we should have done sooner, I know, but no one likes to feel stupid). We were immediately told one very important piece of information that wasn't clear from the manual -- if the handle is pulled up to its highest position, the machine will not turn on -- you must press down on the handle until you hear a click -- then presto! It works. From the quick response to our question of what to do, we surmise we aren't the first folks who have had this issue.  We both felt relieved, a bit foolish, and somewhat irritated at the amount of time we had wasted. Though very pleased with the cleaning results produced by the CrossWave, I find this to be a very sensitive (indeed, persnickety) machine. Also, there are a number of maintenance steps required after every cleaning: eg, dismantling and rinsing out the parts, drying them for 24 hours, cleaning the filters, etc., etc. While it is to be expected that you must do some cleaning and maintenance after each use, this is a pretty comprehensive process.  If you are seriously considering this unit, you might want to factor in these additional steps which do add a little time to your cleaning process. I would suggest that the prospective buyer go to the Bissell website and check out the online manual before deciding whether this is the machine for you.  Kudos to Customer Support for their quick help, but I wish the manual had more clearly addressed this  crucial bit of information.  We respectfully suggest they add that  point to the troubleshooting page.UPDATE - - After more experience with this product, I still have some mixed feelings about it.  With each use, I have expedited the dismantling and reassembling process to a point where it's not a time-sink and I DO think the CrossWave cleans extremely thoroughly.  Nevertheless, I still feel that there is a degree of fussiness with the product that makes it less than a 5 star experience for me. I think it's between 3/12 and 4 stars: it's definitely good, but not knock-your-socks-off great, in my opinion.  For instance, I find that though I vacuum my floors before cleaning them with the Bissell CrossWave, I still  have to stop during the cleaning process to unplug the blockages that seems to occur too frequently for my liking -- that means more dismantling and reattaching of parts and the unpleasant task of removing a filthy wad of stuff from the intake tube that leads to the filter before getting back to the actual process of cleaning. This can happen even when tackling a fairly small area (my master bathroom, for instance, and the small area rug that I have in there. Mind you, some rugs shed more than others -- and that's worth considering before using this machine on them).  That's still not a deal breaker for me, but I do consider it annoying and worth mentioning.  Further, after I have cleaned a hard floor and then switched to freshening up an area rug, there's often a splattering of dirty water and matted debris (rug fibers, maybe pet hairs, etc.) that get dispersed back onto the just-cleaned hard floor upon which the rug is placed.  I find that I can't just go over it with the CrossWave and pick up the debris (I guess when the gunk is sodden it's more difficult for the machine to pick up?. Instead, I have to tackle it separately with cleaner and cleaning cloth to tidy up after completing the CrossWave cleaning.  That's also not a huge deal, but it does detract from the whole experience.  In conclusion, I still WOULD recommend this product to a friend, but with the caveats that I have mentioned. I would only add that in practice, I find I reach for this product less often than I thought I would do.  I keep it for heavier cleaning projects but still reach for the old fashioned mop for quicker, more frequent cleanings.","1,646"

SA,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont buy- please read,the United States,4-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I never write ling reviews- hopefully will never have to again.I did the mistake of buying this item, my thought process was it is expensive so it will go real good! Well, turned out the exact opposite!!The first item was working fine for three uses ( in a 2 bedroom apartment) and then stopped, i called Amazon and got connected to Bissel customer service, these people are the worst!! First they requested Amazon rep to get off the line, then took her 20 minutes of stupid questions to tell me that i have to drop off my machine to receive  a replacement machine. So I thought to myself, fine maybe we were unlucky with this one! We received the replacement 6 weeks after we shipped the defective one! Had to go pickup myself ( still alright).We used the second machine for only one full time, next time we turned it on, cleaned the small living room and started smelling like something is burning!! Picture is not clear but it literally was melting!I called Bissel immediately, said they will send me a return label and will again send a replacement once received, and I should receive the return label in 5-10 business days. 2 weeks after, no return label, i call again and the customer rep “apologizes” and “will look into it” i told them if i don’t receive a shipping label from them in 3 days, i am writing a very bad review with all what happened to me from them, nothing happened again!I called Amazon, returned the machine to them, got my refund. And just yesterday (3.5 weeks) later, I received the return label in mail, which i threw in trash since i have already returned my machine.Beware of this product And company!!",7
SeeYouLtr79,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for smaller homes or ones where kids are tracking in dirt all of the time from outside,the United States,16-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Yes, I very much like this and despite my dog things the rollers are his bone... I've used it faithfully since November. So here is my take. This was a splurge as I have a Shark Navigator and a Shark SteamMop.... so this was something I would use to replace both steps. It cleans really good - I start on the rugs and move to the floors. So I live on a very small farm and I have one dog (doesn't really shed). We go outside often to feed chickens and such and most times we remove our shoes inside. Our main floor is our most high traffic and really the only place I use this - total of 6 big rooms and a mud room where the dog crate is for nights. This vacuum is SO DISGUSTING after one use. I mean it finds stuff I didn't even realize was there and well, it gets clogged so fast (dust and such) that it really slows down the sucking... so I typically have to empty it at least once before I'm done (where the filter is). Also, I didn't realize how much effort it would take to clean the thing when I'm done! I have actually run the bottom of the vacuum under the utility sink to get it all out and all the gunk unstuck. I mean it works and works well, but I'd prefer a powerful vacuuming and then a steam mop and not have to deal with the yuck afterwards. My sis loves this vacuum but she doesn't have three kids and doesn't go outside much like we do... so maybe it would be better for small homes that don't have high traffic!",22

I’m always impressed with the amount of nasty water I dump out after each use.Its very user friendly, lightweight, and dependable.I recently switched and bought the pet brush roll and solution and it fits my original crosswave perfectly.Thank you bissell for making my life a little easier!",14
Dan Mobey,1.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATE,the United States,19-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Was four star but no moreUsed this about four times.Stopped working! Motor turns off and on.I'll let you know what happens======Wanted to wait for a few uses before reviewing.We have two big Goldens and they are, to say the least, messy.We got this hoping it would remove the water and dirt stains from the hardwoods. We tried other things with mixed results. We liked the idea of it picking up the dirty water.First, technique matters. If you just randomly run this over hardwoods you'll pick up a lot of dirt but you'll leave a lot also.What I found works best is:1 - use about 1/2 again as much concentrate as they recommend. Hopefully it won't shorten the unit's life but I'm just telling you what works.2 - go in short movements forward with the trigger down the whole time releasing liquid and then SLOWLY pull it back over the same area; we're talking two to three feet at a time.3 - move side to side getting new areas and then after about four feet, with no trigger released, slowly move back over the area just done to do more scrubbing and to pick up more water.It takes patience but the last use with this technique resulted in an astonishingly better outcome.The only reason it's not five stars is because cleanup afterwards isn't ideal but I'm not sure how they could make it easier.Not cheap but worth the money (assuming it lasts).",8
sara j sick,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t buy it, it doesn’t work if you actually like having clean clean floors.",the United States,5-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This purchase was a huge dissapointment. I spent more time trying to get it to work on a small area than I would have if I just grabbed my vacuum and mop and I could of finished the whole house.  It clogged twice while using it. It does a terrible job on rugs and you can see the streaks the cheap wheels that barely roll left on the tile in the entry way. Granted that area is heavily soiled but if it’s not even close to replacing a broom let alone vacuum and mop. It looked like it did better on the hardwood floor area in my kitchen but it’s probably because I can’t see the streaks as easily there.  Just don’t buy it.,21

Denise,5.0 out of 5 stars,If the machine leaves streaks...,the United States,8-Sep-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I read one review that talked about disappointing streaks left on the floor.  My machine initially left streaks and I was pretty bummed.a) I sweep before using it on the hard floors.  We use clumping cat litter.  I can not vacuum up clumping litter and simultaneously wash the floor with this machine.  I found that to be a disaster.  I didn't have just ""normal"" streaks... I had mud streaks!  So I sweep the floor first.  (I should remove a star since the machine is advertised to both sweep and mop at the same time.  But I just love the machine 5+ stars worth!)b) I had to take out the roller and hand wash the roller (with a few drops of dish detergent) half way thru my floor cleaning.  Like everyone else - I was SHOCKED at how dirty my floors were!  When my floors were that dirty... the filthy roller left terrible streaks.  I've been using the CrossWave weekly or every other week for about 3 months.  I can now do the entire floor and do not need to wash roller until the end, when I put it away.  And I no longer get streaks.My carpet cleaners wanted to do my tile and Pergo floors.  They said that I was moving the dirty water around with a mop and it really needed to be vacuumed up.  I didn't believe them... but now I do.I love this machine!",26
RW,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love it.,the United States,1-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this product, it cleans just ok. I have a dog and all the hair gets stuck under the machine and in between the wheels, very stressful. Now I need to clean a machine & my floor. Although, I will say I had broken glass on the kitchen floor and it vacuumed all that up and chopped it up into small pieces. Concept of machine is good but too much hassle to open everything and clean all pieces then to have to drag the machine into the shower to rinse off the bottom. Hopefully there will be a improved model in the near future.Update....I hate this machine, I can’t believe I paid money to buy this hassle of a headache. For the price you pay you’d figure they’d have a button to keep the cord all tidy. Anyhow, I’ve figured it takes twice as long to clean my kitchen floor now because it just moves around dog hair mixed with dirty water when it doesn’t get vacuumed up. I’d rather vacuumed and then manually mop the floor much easier to empty vacuum and dump mop bucket then to have hair stuck all under the crosswave and then have to dump contents in  the sink and clean all the mess in there. Plus the roller brush is hard to clean too, no matter how much you clean it, it still smells bad. And yes I did buy replacements for the roller brush and filter but not worth the money or hassle.",8

lid,3.0 out of 5 stars,it’s easy to use,the United States,24-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’ve only used it once so far but I echo what many others have said: it’s easy to use, does a fantastic job of cleaning the floors, it does miss about an inch from the wall, and there is no screen to filter out hair or “chunks” so you can’t empty the dirty water chamber into your sink (unless you want to deal with clogs). Also, when I cleaned the roller brush as instructed, rinsing it under the faucet, it stayed wet for days. In fact I’m not even sure it’s dry even now.I love that this thing does three jobs in one (vacuums, washes floors, cleans rugs), and I love how clean it makes my floors. And much like others have said, I’m amazed at how dirty the water is even after I thought my floors were pretty clean (before using the machine). Made me want to use this thing every day!I don’t love dumping the bucket out because I don’t want to clog my drain, I don’t love the inch of space left by the walls, I don’t love that the roller brush stayed wet, and I don’t love that there are no attachments to be able to use it on stairs (or upholstery).If this thing hold up throughout the years, I would say the price is right.

Tina,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Concept, Good Execution",the United States,11-Mar-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"AS A REASONABLY LIGHTWEIGHT MACHINE, IT IS EASY TO MANEUVER AND CONTROL.  IT HAS VERY GOOD DRY VAC SUCTION, HOWEVER, WET VAC SUCTION IS NOT QUITE AS EFFICIENT.  WHEN USED FOR MOPPING IT LEAVES THIN TRAILS OF LIQUID HERE AND THERE.  I HAVE TO GO OVER THE FLOOR WITH MY DRY MOP, ESPECIALLY WHEN USING ON MY HARDWOOD FLOORS.  I CONSIDER THIS WORTH MENTIONING, ALBEIT A MINOR INCONVENIENCE OVERALL THOUGH.  IT TRULY BEATS MY STEAM/VAC FOR MY HARDWOOD FLOORS, ON WHICH THE STEAM WAS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE.  NOW I JUST USE THE STEAM/VAC ON MY BATHROOM TILE FLOORS.I MAKE MY OWN CLEANING PRODUCTS, AND THE CLEANING SOLUTION TANK ALLOWS ME TO USE MY CHOICE OF SOLUTION WITHOUT HAVE TO HACK THE TANK CAP, UNLIKE OTHER DEVICES.OF SIGNIFICANCE IS THE FACT THAT THE DIRTY WATER TANK CAN POSE A CHALLENGE WHEN TIME TO EMPTY IT.  THIS IS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SIMPLY CONTAIN DIRTY WATER AS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO, BUT ALSO SOLID DEBRIS AND WHAT ESSENTIALLY AMOUNTS TO MUCK.  AFTER I USED IT THE FIRST TIME, WHEN I WENT TO EMPTY THE DIRTY WATER TANK, IN ADDITION TO DIRTY WATER WERE BITS OF FOAM, LOTS OF HAIR, AND LINT, BOTH SIDES OF A BROKEN CLOTHING SNAP, SEVERAL LITTLE SHARDS OF HARD CARDBOARD, A RUBBER BAND, AND A SCRUNCHEE, ALL OF WHICH HAD BECOME ENTWINED AROUND 2 HAIRPINS.  LUCKILY I NOTICED THE HAIRPINS STICKING OUT BEFORE I DUMPED THE TANK, AS THE CLUMP OF METAL, MUCK AND DEBRIS COULD VERY WELL HAVE CLOGGED UP A SINK OR IN MY CASE, THE TOILET.  I HAD TO STRAIN THE DIRTY CONTENTS THROUGH A STOCKING INTO A BUCKET FIRST, DUMP THE STOCKING IN THE TRASH, AND THEN EMPTY THE WATER INTO THE TOILET.  LESSON LEARNED, TO INSPECT THE FLOOR FIRST FOR THINGS OF THAT SORT, OR TO SIMPLY VACUUM FIRST, EMPTY THE TANK, THEN MOP, WHICH IS MY PREFERENCE BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HANDLING THE MUCKY FILTER.  ALSO, I USE A HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SOLUTION INSTEAD OF PLAIN WATER, IN THE CLEANING TRAY TO KILL GERMS AND DISCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OF MOLD/MILDEW.THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THIS MACHINE IS GREAT.  I RATE IT A 4 VS 5 FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.  (1) BECAUSE I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE A STRAINER IN THE TANK.  (2) YOU HAVE TO BE CERTAIN TO LEAN IT ALL THE WAY FORWARD WHEN NOT IN USE OR IT CAN SUDDENLY FALL BACKWARDS ONTO A SURFACE – NOT GOOD IF IT HAPPENS TO BE A GLASS TABLE.

Elias and Kait,1.0 out of 5 stars,So disappointed I might cry...,the United States,22-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’m recently disabled with seven dogs and can’t use a deck scrubber on my grain textured vinyl floors anymore. I’ve had to let piss go on the floor for days sometimes. I had a Hoover floormate mop-vacuum before but it’s pretty cheap and lacking in many areas while also including a major design flaw that rusted away the motor within months.The thought of something better quality AND all in one made me so happy.I was saving up every penny I could to get this because I was SO excited for it to make my job/disability even just a LITTLE easier. And now all I can say is, I have no idea has this has a single good review.The tiny bit of water it uses that actually gets on your floor ISNT picked up. (I assume to compensate for such small tanks - don’t need a big bulky tank for water or dirt if you don’t spread any water OR pick any of it up!)The soap gets frothy and gets left behind in floors with texture/cracks/creases.It can’t get less than 2” away from any walls or corners making it FAR from an “all in one” cause you have to get those areas with a different cleaner.IT DOESN’TSCUB FOR ANYTHING! Tried it on multiple surfaces with a million different kinds of stains and consistencies and it did NO BETTER than a $40 swiffer WETJET!!!The ONLY good thing about this is not having to vacuum before you “mop”, but it’s not actually good IF IT DOESN'T MOP!",5
Brianna,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,14-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is not a very good vacuum or mop. It is cool that it does both but it’s not very good at either. I wouldn’t recommend it honestly. For the price just get yourself a nice vacuum and nice mop. I feel like I am constantly struggling with it whenever I use it. I got this because I thought this was a piece of magic that would do everything I needed it to. Don’t get me wrong, it definitely works! The tank is always gross after. It just could be better in my opinion. I am left with puddles and the suction is not strong enough to pick up most thing. I vacuum before I use this every time because it know it won’t get the job done. The cleaning process after isn’t too bad. It has the self clean feature which works really well. You still have to clean all parts after that - so don’t let that feature sell you. I have a long haired dog that sheds an insane amount and I have very long thick hair that also sheds an insane amount. I haven’t had too many issues with the hair. It gets wrapped around the brush but can just be pulled off when cleaning afterwards.If you do get this, the filter for the crosswave pro (purple one) can be used in here. You can find it on Amazon and it fits perfectly. It makes cleaning much easier but separating the dry from wet.The bottom of the crosswave also accumulated a lot of dirt which I find the water turns into mud.I have attached photos of the dirty tank, the filter, the brush area after the self clean function but before being cleaned by hand, the bottom of the crosswave after cleaning/self clean and the puddles of water left on the floor.And for the love of god do not get distracted and forget to clean the tank after. It will smell like something died after a few days.",6
Rima Darwich,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,the United States,23-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"NO NO NO NO! I purchased this crosswave 7 months ago, and let me tell you, it is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I’m not usually one to leave reviews, especially negative ones like this. But I thought I’d warn other customers before purchasing this product. It’ll work well for the first few times you clean, and then it’s all go downhill from there. You’ll find dirty streaks all over your floors that you’ll have to go over and clean with another wet product. The suction slowly stops picking up little pieces off the floors and carpets. After every cleaning, you must clean every inch of the vacuum, take it all apart and basically deep clean it. I have white glossy tile in my kitchen and if I don’t clean the vacuum twice a day, my grey grout will turn black! What a waste of money! I definitely won’t be buying anymore bissell products anymore.",6
Paradise,2.0 out of 5 stars,Had so much potential,the United States,27-Mar-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Okay, so I have 5 kids under the age of 12. The amount of mess they can create in a day would have FEMA waving the white flag. I've given up on trying to have a clean house and have settled for just being happy if I don't stick to the floor. I've got brooms and mops and vacuums and steam mops and everything in between but each of those things does a relatively specific action and can't really handle complex messes which means I have to go over the same surface multiple times with different products. This was supposed to be my savior. It can handle dry messes, wet messes, and somewhere in between messes all at the same time. And I have to say, for fresh messes, it works pretty well.  My biggest disappointment with this is it's total inability to clean dried or sticky messes. I've scrubbed over the same sticky spot on my kitchen floor for the better part of 5 minutes and it looks maybe 50% improved. If I had just gotten a wet rag and wiped it by hand it would have likely been clean in 3 or 4 swipes. But here I am standing on the principle that I bought this stupid thing specifically because I was tired of scrubbing things by hands and damnit, I'm refusing to scrub it by hand!  It does do a pretty decent job suctioning up any water as long as it's on a totally level surface. Grout lines? Yeah... that ain't happening. Your tile will be nice and dry, but your grout lines will be flooded with nasty, dirty water.I will say it does a surprisingly decent job on carpet. If that's why I bought it, I'd be impressed with it. But I already have a carpet shampooer that I love, that wasn't the reason I bought this thing.The things it does well, it does well enough. But the things it cant do (scrub, suction grout lines) are the sole reason I made this purchase. I'll keep using it and complaining about it until one of the kids breaks it and I won't lose any sleep over it. And in the meantime I'll keep looking for something that actually delivers on the Crosswave's empty promises.",12
Hunter,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a replacement for swiffering + vacuuming.,the United States,31-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’ve had the crosswave for about a year and can now give an honest review. It worked like magic the first time. I was actually shocked and really impressed. I think most of the crosswave customers are people like me who wanted to replace the 2-step process of wet swiffering + vacuuming with a 1-step wet-dry vacuum option. THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION. The crosswave, if anything, is a great added third step. You canNOT use this as a single solution for keeping your floors clean. I deep clean my floors once a week… sometimes more. I also meticulously clean the machine after every use. Cleaning up the machine sometimes takes longer than cleaning 1,800sq ft of floors. If you do not pre-clean (wet swiffer and vacuum) your floors before using the crosswave, it will just push dirt around and create mud leaving a disgusting grey chalky residue with hard streaks everywhere. It’s also important to note my floors are not super dirty. I sweep, wipe, and vacuum every day to keep them in good condition using the crosswave (without pre-cleaning the floors) over the weekend left my floors dirtier than they were before I used it.  I’ve recently stopped using it and just went back to swiffering and vacuuming because it’s just not worth the effort. Currently looking for more capable products. Hope this helps : )",3
HomeShopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum & Mopping…Save your Back…BUY IT!,the United States,8-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Bissell Crosswave 1785 -Corded(green & white model)I reviewed the newer cordless, battery powered Crosswave Max, simply because “who likes cords right”?  Then further reviewed this model & one for pets. Finding the corded models are stronger in suction, brush spin has faster rpm’s & ya won’t run out of power after 30 minutes.  The only difference between this model & one marketed for pets is this one doesn’t have the set in strainer for hair.I have pets… hair everywhere within minutes of cleaning. In a house with floating laminate & ceramic tile flooring throughout.Never ending job, literally.I am also a disabled 65 y/o with a bad back, so vacuuming for me, isn’t so bad, as I have an awesome, pivotal Shark vacuum, which I do in segments, vacuum abit, sit abit etc.But, oh… the mopping, can’t really say I can do a good clean mop job, as by doing both it usually left me literally in tears & crippled for next few days afterwards… while we walk around in “hairy socks” until I’m able to swifter some up or attempt to vacuum again.I Received it today, within days of ordering, item as described.  I was so anxious to give it a go!  Just pop in the handle, read the simple instructions and off we go!OMG…OMG…OMG!  This machine is beyond awesome!  It is a little heavy, but constructed very well. Packaging & reviews fail to mention the handle swivels. There’s 2 buttons atop the handle, 1 for hard floors & other for area rugs, the buttons light up on which option you’re using.“What’s the difference”?  Button for area rugs, puts down twice as much cleaner/liquid, and instructions advise you can use the area rug option if your floors are really dirty. Nice huh?  This little guy isn’t a full on carpet cleaner, but the option allows to remove hair, dirt & dust from your area rugs.Came with a small sample bottle of the “multi-surface” solution which can be used on hardwood, tile & rugs.  I had ordered a 3 pak of 32 ounce & an 80 ounce “antibacterial” solution as well.Solution bottle is easy to remove & replace, and has the water to solution mix ratio clearly marked on the bottle. Note:  my first round of solution went well, it does not foam. Had seen reviews reporting solution bottle leaked. Well, on my second round of mixing & replacing the bottle into the machine… it was leaking in big drops, I removed the bottle and cap, replaced the cap and noticed you can over tighten it… so, please don’t feel you’ve got to wrench it on… just nicely tighten to secure and reinstall…. The leaking stopped instantly.Also, had read reviews of “streaking”, expect streaking if your floors are really dirty and need a second go!  And, to be expected, as in my case, had slight streaking in few areas, due to mixing of past residual cleaners.  Knowing this, I didn’t freak, panic or dislike the machine for it…as I know, these will disappear after a couple more cleanings.I had thought to possibly “rinse” just using plain water, but hey, it’s not a game changer since my pets hair, will cause me to use it daily.It was very easy to use… it glided across the floor with little effort & strain. I was able to do my entire house and wasn’t left crippled, crying in pain.LEFT THE FLOORS… literally SQEEKY CLEAN!And left the whole house smelling clean & fresh.Wanted / needed this machine since it came out, but the price was the factor… now, I’m disabled & still attempt to maintain my own home… it’s worth every dollar!BUY IT!  As it exceeded my expectations and will allow me to vacuum & mop… daily.. without killing myself.Has a “multi purpose” roller, made of soft thick microfiber and a few rows of medium to soft bristles. These did not scratch at all, but did an awesome job picking up pet hair, dirt, debris without tangling. Suction is comparable to my upright Shark vacuum and is surprisingly strong. There’s several other brush rollers available w/extra filters available really cheap and compatible or better than what came with the machine. I’d ordered a mult-pak of different rollers to have on hand… cuz this machine is gonna work a lot here!Seemed odd to even think about triggering cleaning solution onto hairy, dirty floors, but it’s a 2 tank system, with suction that doesn’t allow for making mud, before & while your cleaning. The pick up tank, wow, was easy to remove, empty, rinse & replace.  There was no issues not having the “strainer”, as it collected the hair with ease.Clean up afterwards was a snap… just remove, empty & rinse your tanks… remove the roller & rinse thoroughly, hand wring, fluff & place on the machines cleaning tray to dry. The filter removes easily, flips open and rinse out, and dry it too on the cleaning tray.IF YOU NEED THIS MACHINE… BUY IT!YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!I’m a Bissell Crosswave lady forever now… I look back at the years of double duty, just to have clean floors.",3
Semaj,1.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuums! Mops! But there’s huge drawbacks,the United States,14-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Sigh. I’m really upset to leave such a bad review for a product that I’ve been wanting for so long. Yes it mops and vacuums all-in-one, but as always there’s a catch. It comes at the cost of being EXTREMELY high maintenance! Now that may not be a drawback for some, but the entire product is centered around the idea that you are cutting down your cleaning time by doing both things at once. The other HUGE problem with it being so high maintenance is that it’s extremely DIFFICULT to clean. For starters, the vacuum DOES NOT filter the solids from the liquids. So all those broken eggs and cereal with milk is gonna be one disgusting soup of milk, shells, cereal and yolks/whites. This makes it difficult to dispose of. The dirt chamber is designed so that it has lots of sharp corners which make it easy for all of that gunk I just mentioned to get stuck in and makes it hard to clean it. There are lots of nooks and crannies that you wouldn’t even notice that you have to clean but you do, otherwise the vacuum will loose suction power or start to smell whenever you use it. Even worse, I cleaned my brush the way they instruct you to, but it wasn’t clean enough apparently because when I went to use it one day dirty juice leaked allllll over my floor making an even bigger mess. It was disgusting! So now I wash the brush thoroughly by hand which of course takes even more time. I clean the vacuum very thoroughly after every use. I’ve come to barely use it because of this. I just find myself sweeping these days which is such a shame. Overall, this is a great concept but I absolutely would not recommend this bissell product to anyone until they either make it less high maintenance or easy to clean. Unfortunately, I did recommend it the first day I got it because I was so excited. My neighbor purchased the pet plus and they don’t even use it! She still uses the $60 vacuum she had previously. I feel so bad and embarrassed. 2 $200+ vacuums just sitting around collecting dust. Such a let down.",7
s.r,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOISY - like a micro jet engine in your house,the United States,1-Aug-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The vacuum and cleaning side of this device is fine.  However, it is NOISY, and sounds something like a cross between a norse banshee and scratching fingernails on chalkboard.  It has a multi-tonal whine that hits both the piercing high tones that grate on your frontal lobes, and and a middle resonance that makes it even worse.  While I suspect standing next to a jet engine might sound worse, don't go near this if you have ever felt high pitched squeals are a bother.  Vacuums, in general, whine, because they are fans and all that.  This thing, they somehow managed to make it 10x worse.  Sorry Bissell, I made a mistake and should have just gone with a competitor.  Next time spend more time managing the decibles.  I'd rather have a heavier bigger bulkier vacuum and have it be much quieter!  I literally have to leave the house when somebody uses this device.  Crazy.",16
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Probably wait on this one.,the United States,9-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to love this. The idea of vacuuming while mopping is, simply, life changing with two toddlers.But, I was underwhelmed.Pros:1. Cleans the floor at least as well as previous steam mops I’ve had.2. Actually cleans rugs really well, but I only have one rug.Cons:1. Loud as heck. I must’ve missed that in the reviews. My kids are terrified.2. It’s a bit temperamental. You have to suck up the foam going forward. It doesn’t do great picking it up going backward.3. Pricy. On the scale of sponge on a stick to super robot vacuum, I probably would’ve been happier with $75-$100 less.4. TOO. MANY. PARTS. TO. CLEAN. this is the number one reason I would encourage you to wait for another iteration of this. They clearly did not have a busy mom weighing in on this. If all they could all go in the dishwasher or clothes washer, this would not be such a pain, but I just don’t have time to gently soap off various part of my mop.",4
amazonloverjo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Died after a year :/,the United States,3-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this product because we got a new puppy 8 months ago and I wanted something to speed up cleaning the floor. I really liked the convenience of vacuuming and cleaning the floors at the same time - It seemed to do a pretty good job of cleaning but not quite what you get by applying pressure with a mop - as some stains or dried on mess would remain - At the very least you would have to go back and forth many times before it did anything. Also doesn't clean all the way up to the baseboards.I have been using this to clean the floors once a week in a 1500 square foot tile house -A year after purchase the solution stopped spraying and now the motor is fried. I give it 3 stars because it was convenient to use and did clean the floors - however, it only lasted a year and didn't clean as well as separately vacuuming and mopping so I subtracted two, especially considering how expensive this product is.",13
MaryJane,1.0 out of 5 stars,not what I expected,the United States,23-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"this was absolutely horrible. So sad to even write this review. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because they let me return it with ease. I wanted to love this so bad! Who doesn't want a vacuum carpet cleaner all in one!? Sadly I had to return it and just buy a vacuum and carpet fleaner separately. It just wouldn't work well as a vacuum at all. The video shows it sucking up spaghetti! A whole plate of it! Sadly this vacuum couldn't even handle sucking up cereal off the floor let alone anything else. I didn't even get to test it on cleaning the carpet or my tile floors. It didn't pass the vacuum test so sadly it had to go. I have 3 kids. I need a vaccum that will suck up anything and everything lol! This just didn't cut it sadly. Very disappointed and hope someone comes up with a better invention soon! This is a great idea. Just poorly executed. That being said, it may work well for someone who just needs light cleaning. Also the company made the return so easy that I do recommend at least trying it tp see if it works for you. No harm in that since they accept returns and even pay for the return shipping. The company alone deserves 5 stars. Sadly the product for me deserves a 1. So I compromised and gave a 3. Thanks for making the return so easy. So sorry this product didn't work for my family. I hope it works well for others!",4
Sharon L. Aitchison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Floor cleaning Game Changer!,the United States,10-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure, as there were a couple of negative reviews.  But the 3-5* reviews convinced me.  If there's anything I like is a clean house .. and having it clean without killing myself!  I received this today, put it together in a matter of minutes ... read through the instructions first, of course.  It couldn't be easier to use! It's light in weight, yet does a great job.  I purposely did not vacuum, dust or sweep floors from the day I ordered it. I was SHOCKED when I finished and cleaned out the dirt-collection cup.  Thought I kept a truly clean house!  This little machine even picks up the debris ... including driveway grit, from the scatter rugs by the doors. Our laminate flooring came truly clean ... our house is about 70 yrs old, so the floors aren't perfection flat under the laminate .. doesn't matter to this machine ... the roller manages to hit all the spots.  There were a couple of places by the kitchen range and prep area that had bits spilled / dripped and I left them as a test. Yup, cleaned no problem.  I think, if used and cleaned and stored as proscribed in the manual, it should be no problem.  It is, however, my first use, I will adjust my review if I find otherwise down the line.  The 3-star for durability I hit only because I haven't used it but once. So far, so good! AND, the pet solution has a bit of febreeze in it ... not a lot! .. so it even smells nice and fresh!  LIKE IT!",8
Cynthia B,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money I wish I would have bought it sooner,the United States,11-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this so much it has saved me so much time! The only down side is we don't have an pets but I guess we have alot of human hair that got picked up and it would get stuck in the brushes just the whole thing comes apart so well and easily it easier to take out. Suction is awesome cleans amazing.  I only wish the dirty water tank was larger I have alot of hard floors and have to empty it often,7
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,HUGE TIME SAVER AND FLOORS ARE TWICE AS CLEAN!,the United States,29-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I can’t believe what I am seeing right now. I just spent 3 and a half hours sweeping and mopping the whole house (2200 square feet of laminate and tile and a few rugs) 4 days ago. This process required first a dust mop, second with a regular broom, then mopped with an electric mop and mopped again with a swifter sweeper. I was very content with how clean the floors were after that exhausting process then.  I got this bissell crosswave yesterday that I ordered Here on Amazon after going through all of that. We have run over the floors with a dust mop everyday since then.  I just went over the floors again last night using ONLY this Crosswave and filled the tank up 2 full times with thick mud and dog hair! It only took me one hour to do all the floors in the entire house! Then today I went over it all again just out of curiosity) and it picked up this much more already! I am completely blown away! The cleaning doc allows you to flush out the brush roller leaving only the tank to empty and rinse afterwards. I am sold! Though I only just got it yesterday and can’t vouch for how durable it is or how long it will be working, I will say this is worth every penny! With three indoor short hair labradors keeping the floors clean has always been a Very laborious and time consuming task that has to be repeated every week even with dust mopping being done daily. This has knocked the time down from a solid 3.5 hour task to just one hour and the floors are TWICE as clean after using the crosswave than they are after the grueling process I was going through before. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! when my husband came home yesterday he was shocked at how great the floors looked and felt and how clean the house smelled. I found it for a little bit cheeped through Sam’s and through the Bissell but had trouble processing the order and the wait time through both sites was 3-5 weeks. It only took 3 days to get here through Amazon.",5
jillybean,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor scrubbing power,the United States,11-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"First of all, for those reviewers criticizing those who use a damp mop: get off your high horse! The Bissell Crosswave is little better than a Swiffer Wet Jet and a helluva lot more expensive.I’ve been using Hoover Floormate machines for years but thought I’d try this when my last Floormate died. Here’s a comparison of the two.1. The Crosswave is lighter. But that’s probably a bad thing because I tended to move it across the floor faster and had to intentionally slow it down to let it pick up as much dirt as possible.2. The Crosswave doesn’t have as much suction as the Floormate.3. The Crosswave doesn’t put down as much cleaning solution as the Floormate or else the microfiber roller absorbs most of it as soon as it’s ejected. Either way, there’s not much cleaning solution to suction up.4. The microfiber roller with a few rows of bristles just doesn’t scrub as well as the Floormate. Like I said, it’s a Swiffer with suction.5. The Crosswave has better maneuverability than the Floormate. This was my favorite aspect of the Crosswave.The Crosswave costs nearly twice as much as the Floormate and has practically  no scrubbing ability. To be fair, I have the floor from hell. It is a luxury vinyl laminate with a textured surface. I didn’t put it down; the previous owner did. It’s gorgeous but that textured surface holds onto dirt. The Crosswave is probably best for smooth vinyl laminate, terrazzo  and smooth tile floors. It will not clean grout. I didn’t use it on wood floors  but I’d be hesitant to use it on a hand scraped manufactured wood floor because I don’t think the suction is powerful enough to remove all of the water. This will be returned and I’ll go back to the Hoover Floormate.",5
Richard E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Upright Wet Cleaner that Picks Up as it Cleans,the United States,29-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for upright ceramic tile and grout cleaning tool. Had it for 10 days and used it on three areas including 1 area rug. I would like to have hoped for 10 out of 10 but it is giving me 8-9 so far. I was not looking for vacuum cleaner but a cleaner that would vacuum the dirty residue as it cleaned.Results:In all case I vacuumed the surface prior to using the Crosswave. The standard brush and Bissell Multi Surface cleaning fluid was used.Ceramic FloorVacuumed and wet sponge mopped weekly 17 years old and never professionally cleaned. Grout color “Bone #382”.If grout is lightly soiled you will need to make several passes over the area to achieve acceptable results.If grout is heavily discolored with contamination you need to use grout cleaner and grout brush fist then apply Crossover for acceptable or almost new results. Multiple passes are needed.In both cases the unit collected ~ 85 % of the cleaning fluid that was dispensed. My opinion the extraction results were good, as you need to take evaporation into consideration. I also worked some areas 2 to 3 separate times in all cases there was evidence in the collection container that some contamination were extracted.Important to understand that if your grout color is light it will take 24 hours for all the moisture to evaporate to see the true color/darkness.Area RugNever wet cleaned only vacuumed 12 years old.I made multiple crossings patterns on the rug at 90 and 45 degrees. The unit discharged more cleaning fluid that it collected ~20% . At this point I was concerned that the rug was retaining to much cleaning fluid however the rug was completely dry in 20 minutes with no evidence of saturation to the backing. The collection tub fluid, brush, fluid pathway, underside of the Crosswave were heavily soiled and needed cleaning to return to original state.ConclusionYour “Living Style” is important aspect of your results as in what condition the floor is in when you start is your style “clean” or are you “slopping the hogs”?You have expectations to return your grout to its original color it will require some effort. Using the Crosswave for wet cleaning is not like using a vacuum one or two passes. You are picking up the contamination while you are cleaning and not pushing it around and that in itself is the major benefit that delivers the results.Photos #1 New Grout #2 Cleaned Grout",3

aspearson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, but keep your old vacuum as well",the United States,20-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a really good product.. however, I’ve seen an excessive amount of hype about it and felt the need to leave a review. It does work very well on most surfaces. The one exception is my thick kind of shaggy rug.. which is fine. It gets the hair off that rug well enough. It is obviously very nice to vacuum and mop all in one... especially if you live in a zoo and have hair everywhere (like myself). I have four different vacuum's because I’m a crazy lady, and this one definitely serves a special purpose. I use this one maybe once a month to get a good clean. I don’t use it more often then that because it’s disgusting to clean and you have to disassemble all the parts after each use to let them dry out. I definitely do recommend this vacuum; however, you should probably keep your old one as well for day-to-day cleaning.",5
Church goer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very deceiving,the United States,15-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We currently have three dogs and there are three adult women living in a very large home I was elated to see this vacuum being advertised on TV and thought that it would be fantastic for our family however I guess I didn’t read the fine print saying it was not cordless !!!!!! there are no attachments !!!and I have to empty it every 15 minutes I get this vacuum at two star 🌟 ⭐️ it is very loud and it is not convenient.I already have to buy a replacement part because I’ll never use it in half mast did not replace the top part where it suctions the 💦. We have one dog that is very old and when it rains she refuses to go outside so we have puppy pads literally all over our home and if you’re out today each of us change the pad anywhere from 3 to 6 times in a day in his spot however with this vacuum the first day I got down to only having to do one area so now I just have to re-order the part but I’ll have to buy a second vacuum for small areas and cleaning cobwebs. I suppose I’m happy I bought the one that was previously opened but never used because the $50 I said I will not have to spend mine to replace the part does anyone have a suggestion on an actual corners attachment and slightly quieter what to dry carpet so hard for vacuum????,3

I am a short person, the vacuum handle is at the level of my chest, so it is really hard for me to push it forward. It is heavier than I expected, and the handle is not adjustable height-wise.2. My hands are small, I have to use both hands to push it forward, and I keep touching the ""ON"" button and turning the vacuum off.3. The upper part of the vacuum that has the engine, and the both water containers does not lower flat, it is possible to use the vacuum in the open space, e.g., middle of the room, but it is not possible to clean under the armchairs, chairs, side tables, beds.  If I use it to clean the middle of the room, I would need to use a swifter or a broom to clean the corners, under the furniture, and the stairs.Maybe it is a nice product, but I could not use it. Trying to return it.",2
Haley Jaynes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like magic!,the United States,22-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It's phenomenal! My fiance and I received the crosswave as a gift from his mother. Recently we were left with a mess after a leak in the bathroom. As you can see in the video, it works like magic! Yes, occasionally it does leave streaks of dirt. You know what that means? The floor is super dirty and you have to make more than one pass over the floor. Clean it out real quick, and then go back over the floor again. It works great on carpet as well! We have three cats who shed like crazy. The crosswave picked up every bit. As for my hair, it wraps around the brush. So if you or someone in your household has long hair, make sure you clean the brush well!",6
Eduardo Avelar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy unless you like stinky smells.,the United States,25-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Stinky stinky.

Andy Hurley,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as convenient as you hope. Sad face emoji.,the United States,2-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It's loud. Probably not insanely loud for a vacuum, but it's louder than I'd hoped.It does a good job, though. Sometimes you have to go over little pieces multiple times. So it's not perfect, but for the most part I'm satisfied with the performance.The problem is that overall it's arguably not more convenient than a broom plus a mop & bucket, and those don't cost most of $300. The main problem is you have to disassemble it every single time you use it:Take the bucket out. The bucket comes apart, and the filter comes out. Then take the front guard off and remove the brush. So in total, you have 5 wet parts that you have to take apart, carry to the sink, wash, and let dry somewhere. So if you're thinking you're gonna pull this thing out real quick and clean the kitchen floor before company shows up, forget about it - because if you put it away wet and come back in a few days, you'll end up with a stench you won't forget.The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 3 is because ours broke after less than 10 months of very, very limited use. The bottle leaks and the pump that dispenses the solution is broken. Will see how Bissell responds.",3
Alison P. Calhoun,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for light cleaning,the United States,18-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a lot of experience cleaning houses, from vacation rentals to my my own home. I’m a single mother of two boys, and we have a cat and some fish. I had a boyfriend for awhile, and he made cleaning feel like I had an extra kid.This machine works great for light cleaning, and works even better for messes RIGHT WHEN THEY HAPPEN. Also great for once a week, or more often cleaning. Not so great for the floors that haven’t seen a mop in a month or more… the jam blob that got dropped on the floor and stepped in and tracked three times, and then sat for a week+(!)… not-so-much.I was impressed, and embarrassed, at how gross the water was when emptying the dirty water. It clearly works… and the thingy goes in and out easily.I am wanting a scrubbier brush. That soft thing is cool and cute, but my floors need some tough love.I also wish the mop head steamed the floors like a steam mop, so all you needed was water.It’s not the miracle I was hoping for, but when I was done I was deeply satisfied- and I only had to do one pass through the heavily trafficked areas, instead of two or three to get all the hair, crumbs, dust, and coffee spills, off the floor.Take care of it and don’t make it work harder than necessary and it’s a nice little machine.",3
pistol007,1.0 out of 5 stars,So disappointed,the United States,15-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I seriously hate writing bad reviews, but this was such a waste of money I feel I needed to share. I bought because an all in one sounded too good to be true. I already owned the Bissell SpinWave mop (which is amazing by the way!), so I figured I would give this Crosswave a go—-such a hunk of junk! Each function (vacuum, mop, shampooer), is so mediocre. It barely vacuums anything on our shag carpet, and even struggles on our short entry rug. The shampooing function seems like all it does is saturate the carpet with solution, not wash it by any means. The only way I could see this piece being a viable option would be for a college student in a dorm with all hard floors, not for anyone who cleans often and needs it to work thoroughly.Seriously, just get a nice Shark Vacuum and the Bissell SpinWave mop. Those two back to back keep my home up to my standards.",8
Montholon,3.0 out of 5 stars,A floor cleaner that cleans 70% - The rest is for you to do.,the United States,22-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The floor in my house is floor tile, this Bissell cleaner cleans 70%, you have to finish the cleaning job by yourself with rugs or a mop. In the intersection of the tiles, the CrossWave leaves dirty residues From the roller. The CrossWave can be assembled quickly, the cleaning is a little tedious. The roller definitely needs to redesign to do a better job, it doesn’t clean some dried residues. For the service done, the price of this cleaner should be 30% to 40% less.",5
Abnfscoord,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very efficient and convenient,the United States,29-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have always liked Bissell product as them seem to be very pet oriented.  Between a dog and a cat there is no shortage of unwanted hair about.First, this has a minimum of assembly and goes together with ease.  The packaging is excellent and assures an undamaged product.Second, it is very easy to set up and operate.  Filling the water tank is simple with water and the cleaning solution due to very clear marking lines on the tank.  A tip here make sure the top is put back on tight and threaded properly.  I was in a hurry to get to a messy spill and half my solution leaked out due to my error.Third, make sure you read the operating instructions accurately it takes a few squeezes of the trigger to prime the roller brush when dry.  Getting to the brush,  it is very absorbent and has stiff bristles among the softer ones to help with tough stains.  They are similar to a stiff looking fishing line.  The brush does a very good job and you will be embarrassed when you see what comes off of your floor.  It also  does a good job cleaning along the moulding, but occasionally you may need to hit it with a swiffer or etc., with heavy dirt.So far the biggest draw back I have seen is the headlight that comes one when you dispense the cleaning solution.  It works fine to indicate that the solution is dispensing, but is woefully inadequate at illuminating the area ahead.As long as you empty everthing and rinse it well, remove and rinse the brush and store it in the clever desingned storage rack all will be well and fresh for the next use.  I read in one of the reviews the the person soaks the filter, but I have not seen any issues with the filter yet.  I did purchase extra filters as a precaution as well as extra bottles of the solution.  In the same review the Mr. Clean concentrate was used as a sustitute for the cleaning solution, but I have not tried that either.Overall I highly recommend this wet/dry vacume and you will experience sheer joy if you spill some food on the floor and can just breeze over it in a few strokes and the area is clean.",5
Aundrea,5.0 out of 5 stars,A vacuum from the Gods,the United States,27-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So I rarely write reviews but I think it's necessary to write one here. I've had this vacuum for about 3 months, and it's a total game changer!! I recently moved to Vegas and was appalled at how much dust just... Accumulates in your home. And having a husband, two boys, a puppy, and wood floors makes it so much worse. We got tired of sweeping and mopping every day, so we opted for a Roomba and this vacuum. If you're having any doubts about this vacuum, PLEASE use my review as a sign to get it. This vacuum works like a dream. Please follow the instructions because if you don't, you'll have a negative experience like some users. If you're having ""streaks"", it's because the ""used"" tank is full and needs to be emptied out before continuing to vacuum. It vacuums and mops my floors and doesn't miss a thing! It even picks up my German shepherds' hair like NOTHING. And if you know anything about German shepherds, you know they shed a LOT. We've spilled juice, water, soup, and you can literally see the vacuum sucking up the liquids. I am thoroughly impressed. But on to the reason I wrote this review. We came home after 6 hours of water park fun to see that my German Shepherd had explosive diarrhea in his room. It was all over him, the walls, the carpet... It was straight out of a geriatric hospital bathroom. And the smell was so atrocious we could smell it from the garage the minute we opened the door. I had no idea how we were going to get this cleaned and get our deposit back after he just spray painted our WHITE CARPET. I decided to put my faith in the vacuum (it was either that or scrubbing on my hands and knees) and using it to clean up the poop. I did ZERO prep work before hand. I filled the reservoir in the back at the ""large room"" fill line (it was a small room but I felt it necessary) and turned on the ""rug"" setting. After pressing on the sprayer for about 15 seconds, I sloooooooowwwlllly inched my vacuum towards this smeared poop. Slow, steady, and inching forwards and backwards in sections. And to my surprise, it picked that **** UP. I mean, I could not tell it was there. It took me about an hour, but one tank cleaned that entire room. I was in disbelief. It looked like a brand new carpet. To be on the safe side, I ran over it again, but the ""used"" water tank came out practically clear. And the best part, the smell was GONE. It didn't smell like a taco Bell bathroom, it smelled like a new car. I could eat off that floor. I could roll around on the floor naked making snow angels. The vacuum is meant for rugs and hardwood floor but it did a d*** good job cleaning up a carpet too. It cleans hardwood floors better than any standard mop, but I was extremely surprised at the power it contains to clean a small bedroom that's been defiled by a dog who has no regards for the health of others. I doubt most people are looking to buy this specifically to clean up smeared puppy poop, but if it can turn a muddy brown carpet WHITE, I'm sure it can handle almost anything.",2
bas bleu,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a dream come true for me,the United States,20-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have nearly 3000 sq. Feet of engineered hard wood flooring.  I am elderly and it has been next to impossible for me to scrub floors for several years. And this year it became too much for my hubby to manage any more.  We bought the green cross wave as we had no pets and thus not much concern over hair.  I find I have to move slowly with it for it to do its best.  If you are wanting to race through and get done quickly you may encounter draw backs such as :  not all the water gets picked up.....: the motor needs a break if it gets hot, this is not a bad thing it is a protection from burning up the motor. When the motor is hot the crossover shuts down the vacuum to help protect the motor..... Just shut off the machine for 5 - 10 minutes.  For some reason the vacuum sometimes shuts done when I turn the handle to the right or left...I just shut it off bring the handle to the straight up and down position and start again.  I also noticed if I am using the spray water function when the vacuum is not sucking ...guess what... It doesn't vacuum up the water I just sprayed.... that is kind of a no brainer.  The motor can get hot pretty quickly on area rugs and the thicker the rug the quicker the vacuum heats up. I have to let my machine cool longer and more often when doing area rugs.  We are so busy in our lives we want and expect to run everything quickly to get the job done and it can be easy to expect all of our machines to perform miracles cause we are so pushed for time.",2

Fredrc737,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works on glitter!!,the United States,19-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Buy this and buy it now!Purchased because my BFF swears by hers and posts “dirty pictures” of the dirt collector on Facebook.I had a bit of a crafting incident on St Patrick’s Day that left my house covered in glitter. It looked like a leprechaun exploded in my kitchen. My husband was not impressed, so I panicked and ordered this vacuum. In the meantime, I spent 2 days trying to clean it with a mop, broom, rumba, swifter, human sacrifice, and there was still glitter everywhere! The package arrived 3 days early! I immediately got to work. Let me tell you, this thing is a Godsend! It took a couple of passes, because the glitter stuck to me feet and spread onto the clean floors, but it worked! I still have traces of sparkle on my furniture and in my car, but my house no longer looks like a strip club. I have never been so pleased with an appliance. It saved my sanity, my life, and probably my marriage.In all seriousness, it works. If you are on the fence- buy it. It is money well spent.",2
Leigh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my situation!!!!!,the United States,3-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Read reviews for days before settling on this. Love that it vacuums and mops at the same time. Had a well reviewed steam mop before, not worth the trouble to use. This however, I would buy again. In fact I did buy the pet version. I like it better because the tank has a strainer to pull all the chunky stuff out of the dirty water side. Gross, but it was on the floor before so better in the tank than in my house.  It still has trouble getting really stuck on stuff off, but any mop would. (Even a manual mop.)  I have not tried it on any rugs so no info for you on that. Cleaning the equipment is kinda involved after you are finished mopping. I have 1,800 feet of hard floor to clean-that makes this machine well worth it to me. If you only had a small area to mop and you were doing it several times a week, a manual spin mop might be more appropriate for that. I would definately buy this for myself again if the one I have lasted for at least a few years then went down.",6
Xo Baby Diamond,2.0 out of 5 stars,Seven months update and not happy at all.,the United States,29-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Seven months later update. I thought this was going to be a game changer in my cleaning routine but it's not. The rotation brush melted into the spinning part of the machine. I had to sit there and carve it out without damaging the rotation part or machine would of been useless because the brush wouldn't have spun anymore. It took about an hour to get every piece put of the melted area off. Every time I lift it while being on the water spits out from the back of it. The water cleaning doesn't really give it a nice clean in the end on floors because the end results on the hardwood floors or any floor for that matter it leaves behind streaks once it dries and it's very noticeable. It doesn't leave a clean feeling when your walking on freshly cleaned floors. I find myself going over it with a fresh pad of swifter sweeper and the pad would be dirty like to machine didn't do anything  besides push the dirt around. As for carpet it does a pretty good job at cleaning spots but it takes mutiple attempt to remove stain completely. It sucks pretty good but it's carpet you really can't see the cleanliness like you do on floors. It does have a pretty good suction power but not so good with hair cleanup. It would sometimes jam and the machine will turn off on it's own. I find myself taking the brush out to clean every use. You also have to empty out and clean the whole waste container plus the filter every use of your machine or it will give off a swamp smell in your next use. This machine is very high demand on being cleaned every use or something will go wrong. For it to be this expensive it's not worth it because of the hassle. It's also not as easy for weight lifting it up and down stairs. It's not light and I'm not in my 30s yet and I lift some pretty heavy things but this is a strain bringing it up and down the stairs. Don't use this for carpet stairs it does a terrible job especially with the weight too just don't attempt it. Yesterday was the last straw when I was cleaning the carpets and the machine started vibrating differently like the motor went up overdrive and now the whole machine has this weird strong vibration to it that's not normal like before.. I'm hoping it goes away in my next use but it don't seem like it will be. I found out after receiving it that you have to replace the cleaning brush wish they could of found a more better permanent solution then replacing the brush and filter. I hope this review helps. I should of told myself it was too good to be true.,4
Flojos,4.0 out of 5 stars,Super Clean Floors,the United States,8-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Whether or not you like this product will likely depend on your expectations going in.  If you are expecting a quick and easy alternative to mopping or Swiffering you will probably be disappointed.  However, if you don't mind putting in a little extra time and effort you will be rewarded with super clean, streak-free floors.I use this product on hardwood floors with spectacular results.  The first thing I do is let the Roomba loose to go through the rooms to give the floors a ""once-over.""  I then go over the hardwood floors in a very slow, deliberate motion like I'm operating a carpet cleaner.  On the forward pass I deploy formula and then bring the Crosswave back slowly over the same area to vacuum everything up.  I then go over the same area in perpendicular passes.  It takes much longer than mopping but the results are worth it.  Keep in mind when you're done cleaning you have to take the Crosswave apart and let the filter and roller air dry.  Clean up is not as simple as dumping a bucket of water or throwing a Swiffer pad away.Just a heads-up, the instructions claim you can clean up to 750 square feet if you fill the reservoir to ""Large Area"".  I think that's a stretch as I've never gotten more than 500 square feet, but maybe it's just the method I'm using.  Also, the collection reservoir is on the small side.  I have to stop and dump the dirty water well before the clean water reservoir is empty.",One
allthumbs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surpassed expectations,the United States,11-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Just got my Bissell Cross wave (1785A).  Even though my floors were recently cleaned, I decided to try it out right away. The amount of dog hair this thing sucked up was astonishing. The water was black with dirt. And I thought my floor was clean?!  I wasn't going to get this because it was more expensive than other hardwood floor cleaners and I thought the whole pet hair thing was just a gimmick to charge more. My dogs are both short hair and I don't have that much of a hair problem. Well this proved me wrong. There apparently is much more dog hair on my floors than I realized.  So easy to use (I didn't read directions...just filled it up and plugged it in) and incredibly easy to clean all the parts. Everything just snaps right on/off. The suction on this thing is NO JOKE. Somehow there is no pet hair all entangled and coating the rotating brush thing. I don't know how but all the hair gets sucked in the tank. Also, I don't remember reading this in the description but it comes with an extra rotating brush and an extra filter. So that was a pleasant surprise.  I am very glad I made this purchase. It feels like they are FINALLY putting real science and technology into cleaning products.  A++",2
kbhickman,5.0 out of 5 stars,I THOUGHT we were clean people...,the United States,19-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We take our shoes off in the house, don't have big, messy pets and have our house cleaned professionally every two weeks. I thought we were clean and tidy people. But we also have two kids, and one of them is starting to eat (and throw, drop, spit-up) solid foods, so there's that. I own (and love) a Dyson ball vacuum that has served us well for years, but I'm not going to vacuum up wet scrambled eggs, baby cereal, half-masticated pears. And it won't even touch foods that were once wet but have sat for a few hours and suddenly become one with the tile... cheerios, salmon from the night before, yogurt. Even by hand, getting those things off the floor can be a challenge. And I have better things to do with my time.Enter the Bissell Crosswave. I wanted something that was lightweight, easy to use and clean, and that could handle the gauntlet of kid-related messes. In short, I love it. It checks all my boxes and I especially love how Bissell thoughtfully designed a stand that allows you to both clean the brush and store the cleaned brushes. Just make sure that you clean out the dirty water bin EVERY SINGLE TIME you use it. Otherwise, you'll get an old water smell with the next use. Nothing a good cleaning with hot water and vinegar couldn't fix but I learned my lesson.  Buy this machine, you won't regret it!",One
CountryLane,4.0 out of 5 stars,Are you sure this is what you want?,the United States,15-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was tired of separate sweep/vacuum/mop tasks with my hardwood floor and decided to gamble on the good reviews for this combination unit that does it all. However, as with many other devices that combines functions, it comes with trade-offs. First, it's corded so if you're used to a cordless stick-vac, this is like remembering how to wrestle an anaconda. Second, it's surprisingly heavy and hard to maneuver - much closer to a full-size vacuum than a stick-vac. The swivel head design has a very limited range of motion. Third, the cleaning action is adequate, but not superb. The vacuum works well, but the mop struggles with small spots of caked dirt - though it does well with the general film of dust.Finally, the cleaning process is laughable. For your vacuum, you empty the bin and you're done. Once a month or so, you might clean the filter and the roller brush. For your mop, you pull the mop head cover off and throw it in the wash. For this unit, you first empty the dirty water tank and rinse it out along with its filter cartridge. Then you disassemble the head to pull out the brush and clean it. Now, the instructions say that you can simply put an inch of water in the storage tray and run the unit in place to self-clean. This might work after a single light cleaning, but you can expect to do the disassembly version of cleaning weekly. In spite of all that, it is incredibly convenient to make a single pass over the floor. The build quality also appears to be good, so I'd say it's a keeper.",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Drool fix, convenient, I don't procrastinate anymore",the United States,23-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"First off let me start by saying I took my sweet time replacing what I had been using with this keister saving apparatus. My dog must have some sort of gorilla glue in his drool. I have tried everything that I could think of, pet safe, to remove the mounds of drool spots from our floors. He was about to have his furry butt banished from all hardwood areas. This has made cleaning up the glue drool possible. I have never met anyone super excited to wash their floors, but up to this point the drool had me at an all time procrastinating high. I have say that I am pretty happy with this purchase and no I  was not someone who got this for free or made money off this review, this is real life glue drool I am talking about. Disgusting, slimy, fall on your face, your sock stays wet for 3 hours after if you happen to step in it glue drool. However I honestly would only give this a 4 star rating if it wasn't for the boost in stars for its' remarkable ability to clean up after my pup (worth 10 stars alone as far as I am concerned). It doesn't do well in all corners where a triangler mop would work best, and small spaces can make it hard to manipulate around things. It's kinda loud which is annoying and it doesn't steam. But honestly I don't have any other complaints. I  have tested it on our area rugs as well and it has brought a whole new meaning to fresh carpet smell. It's convenient, easy to use, light weight and I no longer feel ripping my hair out because of the leftover glue drool still residing on our floors. Just a side note it does take a few passes to get it all, I swear he drops an atomic bomb worth drool each time I open his cookie jar.  With that said, anyone else that has glue drool in their life, this is a must have.",One
hugotress,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is a family member now and deserves it's own bedroom. We love it!,the United States,29-Aug-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I'm a cat and dog groomer, cat foster, dog trainer and mom of a 4 year old who has many toddler/kid friends. THE SCENE: fur and hair everywhere, dried food, milk, drinks all over, markers, paint, nail polish, etc all regularly on my tile floors. BEFORE CROSSWAVE: Sweep floors, which led to hair and fur pretending to be confetti in my air. Vacuum the floor to see if I could sneak up on the hair and fur. Pre-soak and scrape up any gross spots. Vacuum up that. Mop once. Walk on floors, realize they're still sticky. Mop again. Finally finish after 2 hours total. Cry the next morning when the pets and kids have destroyed the floors. **Friend swears by Crosswave so I bought it** AFTER CROSSWAVE: You guys, I mopped my floors twice a week, I had various other floor vacs/sweepers/mops from another big brand. I ran this sexy machine over my floors for the first time and could see a color difference in where the CW had gone over even though I mopped the night before. I got my entire living areas done in 15 minutes. There's no pet hair left, no stains, etc. I love this thing so much that. I told my spouse if it came down to him or the CW then I'm sorry but I will never go back to how it was, the CW stays. I literally gained at least 4-6 hours a week by buying this. I can now find the time to clean my floors fully every day.",11
Jackie Wood,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hands free yuk removal!,the United States,2-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I've used this machine 3 times now just trying to get used to it. I started out being a little disappointed in that so little dirty water was actually sucked up BUT I remembered how it works with a commercial carpet cleaner and figured it was the same principal so I started spraying down each area to be cleaned with a watered down floor cleaner first (to loosen the dirt/grime) so then I just had to do one pass with the machine while holding the trigger and then a couple swipes just using the suction. It worked beautifully and I was thoroughly disgusted with how much dirt was on my floor!! .... but now it's gone. I love it. :),2
Brooke,1.0 out of 5 stars,Nightmare of a vacuum,the United States,7-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"There are no words for how much I hate this vacuum. To start, I’ve had it for about 7 months and despite countless efforts to get rid of the overwhelming plastic smell it puts off, it’s as strong as the day we got it. I could possibly overlook that smell if it actually cleaned the floor. With daily use, the vacuum rolls pet hair and dust into a ball and spits it back out. The mop leaves dirty streaks. The only reason to use this vacuum is if you have guests that you want to leave ASAP.",4
Toodle Poodle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't get if you have hair.,the United States,14-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Near as I can tell, the connection point from the motorized spinning point in the bead of the vacuum cleaner where it attaches to the brush roll easily catches and gathers all the long hair.  Anything over 4 inches can get wedged into the minute gaps and cause damage ceasing the rotation of the brush roll and thusly rendering the vacuum useless.  I'm waiting for Bissell to get back to me at this point, but so far it's all crickets.  I paid too much to clean my floors 1.5 times before it locked up and no longer spins.  Without a way to shield microparticles from infiltrating this vulnerable area - this thing is nothing but a giant paperweight waiting to happen.",3
joann cali,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best floor cleaning invention since sliced bread!,the United States,14-Oct-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the best thing since sliced bread. I live in southern Florida, where everybody’s houses have white tile floors. I have a 2000 square-foot home with white tiles on the whole first floor, I also have two parakeets, which led to throw their food and also Lose Feathers on a daily basis. Since I have an open concept home, the first step would always be sweeping or vacuuming the entire bottom floor. Then after that I would have to go around with the mop and wash the entire floor. So for 10 years all I did was go round and round with a mop and a broom. The Bissell cross wave has made my life so much easier. Now I can vacuum as well as wash my floors all in one shot. And since the suction picks up the water I don’t have to do my house in quadrants To wait for each section to dry before I could continue. But wait, there is more- the  best part os that it also cleans your rugs!!!!. What more could you ask for, except for someone else to do it for you! LOL I’ve only had it about six months but I give it as many stars as possible,",4
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life?,the United States,8-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I don't normally write reviews, but after the mixed reviews I read I felt like I needed to leave a review for this. I absolutely love this product.I have a friend that recommended the Bissell vacuum/mop. She has the cordless model, But I read it only holds a 30 minute charge so I knew that it would not clean my house on one charge.  We have 5 cats and 2 females with long hair, so I was very skeptical. I was torn on getting this model or the purple model that is specific for pets. After much research online I decided to go with the green one. I'm super happy I did. From my research,  The only difference is the hair strainer and the brush head. I dump the contents outside so I wasn't worried about the strainer.  I did order the pet brush and the pet cleaner,  And honestly I cannot tell a difference between the pet brush and cleaner and the cleaner and brush that comes with the green model.I am absolutely amazed at the dirt and hair this machine picks up!  We have hardwood floors  Throughout the house and it does an amazing job cleaning them. I have noticed that if the container is full and needs to be emptied the mop head will leave dirty water on the floor,  However after I dumped the contents out and re mop/vacuum over that spot, it sucks it up and cleans it just fine. My husband and myself have back troubles and sweeping alone kills our backs, however with this machine we are able to finally clean the house in one sitting without hurting our backs!I know several reviews said it was hard to clean but it isn't. Its super easy and takes as much time as it would to clean a mop and bucket!  I highly recommend this machine for every one! It saves you time by combining the sweeping and mopping, it's easy on the back and simple to clean, not to mention no more mopping with dirty water!",One
Clarence Golden,1.0 out of 5 stars,Caveat Emptor!,the United States,23-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Purchased item from Amazon. Arrived expeditiously, well packed. Assembly and prep for use, easy, unremarkable.That's when disappointment came. Unit does not clean/vacuum near as well as hype and videos depict. Tried on a hard (tiled) surface. Cleans somewhat and dries quickly, however, a simple dirty spot (not heel rubber or that type of mark...just a wet spot, dried with everyday soil traffic) took 3-4-5 passes to get up. This type of 'spot' comes up readily with one swipe of a mop. The unit might work well on a localized 'spot' as depicted in videos, but for wall to wall floor cleaning ....not so much! Also...had been using for about 5 minutes when a small bump (no ..not a crash or forced bang, just an incidental bump) on the baseboard, or table leg broke the vacuum seal and water ran onto the floor.This problem persisted. Clean-up after use (and for return) is quite tedious, and time consuming, because you have to set pieces, dismantled, to dry. Roller takes forever! Returned the item to Amazon, who graciously accepted the returnNote to Amazon...I wouldn't tout this item.",6
Lilbub,5.0 out of 5 stars,You will never know how dirty your floors actually are,the United States,24-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this for my 800 square foot home where I live with my husband, a toddler, and two indoor cats. Although we don't wear our shoes indoors and vacuum daily, the floors always felt dirty after I used my hardwood floor mop. After seeing an infomercial and reading several product reviews I decided to take the plunge and buy it. I was amazed at how dirty my floors really were the first time I used it! I now use it to vacuum daily, mop twice a week, and use my hardwood floor mop in between mops for a light clean. I've noticed that although the tank is always dark and gross after using it, the color has lightened, meaning my floors are cleaner with each use. When I first started using it, it did streak a little and I assumed that was from left over dirt. It no longer streaks since I've been cleaning with it at least twice a week. I also noticed it would make a strange sucking noise as though it wasn't getting enough airflow when I was nearly done the first few times and realized I needed to empty the dirty water tank about 3/4 of the way through to combat that problem. Other than that, it does a great job and my floors feel so clean after using that I don't even want to wear socks in the house!",6
MurFam12,5.0 out of 5 stars,I thought my floors were clean,the United States,28-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I asked for the bissell crosswave for Christmas and my husband came through. I just used it for the first time today and I'm both horrified by how gross my floors were without realizing it and satisfied by a job well done from this vacuum. I put the ""small area"" amount of solution in the clean water tank and did our two(small) bathrooms, as well as a hallway to start out with. All of these floors visibly looked clean, except one of the bathrooms had some of my stray hairs on the floor(postpartum hair loss stinks). I would normally just vacuum these up with my stick vacuum, but decided to try the bissell out. Attached are the pictures of the dirty water tank and the brush, as well as a hairball I collected. I'm so happy with this product. I loved how easy it was to clean the machine when I was done.  I can't wait until my baby is napping to do the rest of the house.",5
Ann Onymnus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Top Notch Machine, Gets Floors and Rugs Really Clean",the United States,14-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I used a floormate for years, and this is superior in many ways: Much lighter, longer cord, cleans better on most surfaces, gets dust and crumbs as well as smears and grime. The floor is actually perfectly clean after a fairly quick use. It isn't necessary, as some have said, to go repeatedly or very slowly over an area, unless it is very, very stained or greasey. The machine uses a roller, similar to the roller bar in a vacumn, but it is covered with a spongy microfiber fabric (for wood or laminate floors), or with spaced nylon bristles (for rugs), or with a combination of the two. (My machine came with the combo roller, and I purchased the others seperately.) I really, really like the bristle brush for rugs; my rugs are cleaner and brighter than after professional cleaning, and the bristles are GREAT and picking up dog hair. Because I have rugs on an oak floor, I will usually do the rugs first, change the roller, then do the floors. If your rugs are newer than mine, you would probably be happy with using only one or the other, as they all work well (but the microfiber does indeed polish the wood, and the bristles don't). The crosswave has 2 setyings, the only difference in them being that the rug setting deposits twice as much water. The hard floor setting uses very little water, and squeegees/vacumns up almost all of it, so one end of my floor is dry by the time I reach the other end.Can be used with plain water with very good results, if you are averse to chemicals, or with vinegar or any cleaner you like, and uses a lot less than when mopping with a bucket. Personally, I see better results from the cleaner thar came with than with Bona, but use your fave.One drawback, and only one: it gets stinky. I take it apart and clean it thoroughly after every use, but the next time I use it, it unavoidably smells like dirty water for the first few passes. The smell fades shortly, so I can live with it. On the plus side, the machine comes apart easily and is made to be easy to clean. Mine came with a cleaning tray as well, meant to be filled with clean water, and run through the machine to clean the inside. This has not stopped the smell, and I may try adding vinegar or baking soda during this process.All in all, I'd buy this again in a second. (I junked the old floormate, so I'd have to!) If it lasts at least a year, it will have been a great bargain.",7
Jeremy S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,If you're looking to suck the carpet up this will not do the trick,the United States,22-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My wife loves this thing for cleaning our tile floors.  She'll go through about every other week and use this bad boy as a mop/scrubber in one.  It seems to do well.  The water well is always dirty afterwards. However, it really lacks suction on our area rug.  We bought another vacuum for carpet.  In its defense though this one shouldn't be the best in suction. It accomplishes it purposes of providing cleaning spray like a swiffer and a scrub brush to break up most dirt/dried spots. But this is mostly effective on hardwood.  The spray activation button is totally inconveniently placed right in the middle of the handle.  I have accidentally sprayed cleaner more times than not.Pro: Good on hard floors, Lightweight, stylish, easy to assemble, comes with a small bottle of cleaner.Con: Not great suction.  The spray knob is RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the handle. Totally inconvenient.  I don't know if it was my wife or not...but the spinning portions that the brushes lock into are not that tight. One of mine burned up because it didn't have a strong enough bond.  Think of a Philips head screw bit spinning when you don't push hard enough.  Could have been user error, but I'm out a brush because it melted one end.Neither P or C: Cleaning it out sucks...but you're picking up dirt and other crap...so deal with the cleaning really. Disassembling it to clean is easy, but see CON above about brushes and how the seat.Overall: I wouldn't have spent the money on this thing if I had known how weak the suction would be on carpet.  I would have bought a cheaper wet/dry vacuum for my tile and another one for carpet (wet/dry or not).  NOT TERRIBLE on carpet, but I could have bought 2 vacuums for the price of this one.",2

Chris & Rebecca,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you like to clean three times, this is perfect!",the United States,6-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the worst Bissel product I have ever purchased. The suction is nonexistent and the water stays on the floor after several passes. Supposedly this can be used for area rugs, I say nay nay. My rug was soaked and I regretted waiting my morning with the machine. I cleaned my floor, then I had to hang up the rug to dry, then clean the machine. Total pain. To add injury to insult, I have to pay to send this thing back. Ugh.... I have two kids, a toddler and an infant. I do not have time this. I am sending this back and  buying a vacuum and a carpet shampooer. I knew this would not do the job of a carpet shampooer, but it should have been able to clean up the little spot of oatmeal.

Jamie C.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great….but I guess not bad for $199 on sale,the United States,27-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a great concept but it doesn’t work great.Pros:Easy to assembleCheapCons:You have to constantly hold down the spray in order to get the spinner to fully clean evenly.  Even when I was soaking it there were streaks where the spinner either wasn’t hitting the floor or didn’t have any cleaner in it.It’s weak. I had to go over a spilled coffee spot like 3x to get it fully clean. It’s as if the spinner doesn’t press against the floor enough. I think it’s placed too high in the vacuum itself making the spinner barely press into the floor, resulting in an overly gently clean.You have to go really slow in order for it to clean.It leaves streaks and no, it’s not because my floors are sooo dirty.  It leaves streaks of cleaner.Overall it annoyed me more than helped me so I’ll be returning it.",One
Jennifer Loring,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to Really Work - Glad I Bought It,the United States,31-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I'll confess, I was convinced I had to buy this after watching the infomercial. If for no other reason than to *feel* like I was getting my floors/rugs cleaner. We have hardwood with a few large area rugs and I was not enthused about sending them out to be cleaned - thought this would be good to try before doing anything else.This arrived a few days after I'd vacuumed with the Dyson Animal, so I unpacked it, set it up, and went to work. I did not used the included solution, but instead a diluted solution of Nature's Miracle (for cats) with Oxi, because CATS (plural). It doesn't foam up or suds up and doesn't leave a film, even undiluted, and I didn't want any residue of anything left on/in the rugs.Seemed to work great on the kitchen floor - was dry within moments, which is great - usually I have to do a bizarre leg workout of shuffling around with towels under my feet. Then I moved on to the largest rug that the cats love to play on. I won't share photos because someone reading this could be eating. It looked like it picked up MUD off the rug. Mud and residual cat hair that somehow the Dyson did not get, or my cats are just that good at their jobs of decorating the house in their fur. I stopped after that rug to clean it out - pretty easy to do, just takes a few minutes - then moved on to the other rugs in the house. Same thing - MUD. I cleaned it out after each rug, had to, because if there is a lot of dirt in your rugs, it will start tracking dirty water on the floor.I dare say, the rugs definitely looked cleaner and if nothing else, I felt better, even if it was just a surface-level clean. There's only so much time in life for cleaning. I haven't used the carpet brush yet - that might pick up more gunk, we'll see. It's just nice to have a unit that pulls out just about all the solution used so everything dries quickly. Using water alone might work well enough to help dislodge dirt & dust a regular vacuum doesn't get.BTW, used to use a Hoover Floormate long ago, and used it maybe twice to get the kitchen floor really clean. Went back to mopping. It wasn't nearly as easy to use and it was leaky. It's collecting dust in my basement. Bissel seems to be getting it right. We also have the little unit for cleaning upholstery and it's always worked well to clean up small food/pet stains. They make good stuff.",8
Robert Ritter,4.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced under warranty very quickly !,the United States,31-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The Crosswave worked very well until a quest tripped over the machine and somehow several parts got broken (cord holder,water jug lid,brush roller lights) .

For anyone considering this, there are many videos on YouTube showing real people using it and giving pros, cons, and tips.This machine is very heavy. I am in my 90's and some days, it's just too heavy for me. It has to be cleaned every time used. This is no quick fix for an accidental spill! In fact, the wet cleaning function of this vacuum is pretty wimpy for carpeting and not the best I've seen for tile or vinyl.I was hospitalized when this vacuum arrived and wasn't able to use it until the return/refund period was over.

MoSigler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still love my Crosswave!,the United States,9-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought my Bissell Crosswave back in 2017 to use on my laminate wood floors and two large area rugs. I also bought the area rug brush/roller because those rugs end up with a lot of dog hair. The brush roller is amazing in picking up the hair from the rug! (The basic roller also works well when the rugs aren’t extremely dirty.) You can see the before and after photos where there is a distinct difference. I will confess, I don’t use the machine as often as I should because I live by myself with my shedding dog. As a result, I sometimes have a clump of wet hair on the rug, but a few passes with the machine picks up the clumps. On the edges, between the rug and laminate, I’m most apt to see wet clumps on the laminate. If I’m only cleaning the rugs, I just take a paper towel to wipe off the edges. Otherwise, I clean the rugs first, fold over the rug edges so I can clean up the laminate under the rug edge as I am cleaning all of the laminate flooring.I agree that there are some streaks when I use it on the laminate. I always thought the streaks were because the brush wasn’t uniformly wet vs. dirty water being left on the floor. I just overlap my paths to make certain everything is cleaned.I would definitely buy this machine again! It’s wonderful to vacuum and mop at the same time. Each time I use it, it collects enough dog hair to make another dog. Yes, the dog hair gets all over the pieces inside the collection tank. I think that’s just the nature of dog hair.",One

Rita S,5.0 out of 5 stars,Omg!  I’m soooooooo glad I finally own this machine!!!!,the United States,14-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Good grief.  And I thought I was just ordering  this to cut down the workload.  But the dirt this pulled from my hardwood floors was humiliating.  I ran the vacuum  and mopped 2 days ago.....but today when the new Croaswave was delivered I had to try it.  Omg!  I’m glad no one was here to see what I dumped out of the crosswave.  I have dark hardwood floors....I refer to them as my floors from hell.  Most beautiful tiger oak wood with a spice stain.  But floors from Hell.  Impossible to keep clean with 2 dogs.....in a normal day I will sweep 3 times and mop every day.  I love my microfiber mop!  It does a great job.  Floors are always pretty.  But were they clean???  Perhaps not!  But before mopping, I had to sweep, vacuum amd many times run the swifter.  (My dogs are small but they shed like crazy and like to go out often!).  This Bissell does three jobs at one time and saves tons of time.  But honestly, I’m not sure where all that dirt came from!!!!The machine is rather loud and the cord is bulky....if it weren’t so good at cleaning, I’d whine about the noise.  But seeing the results of one session and I am hooked.  Cleans, mops and dries the floor at one time.  Of course, I hate cleaning the machine after using it, but maybe after using it regularly this will not be such a disgusting job.  Bottom line.....don’t hesitate to get one!",5
Volunteer Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy and would recommend,the United States,25-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I used to spend 3.5 - 4.5 hours vacuuming and mopping our floors. I’ve tried a number of mopping solutions that worked fine; however it was time consuming. So I thought I would try this Bissell to see if it would work.Yes it did.  Below are my likes/dislikes for the machine.Likes: - Time saving - vacuuming/mopping our tile floors took only about 2 - 3 hours. About a 40% reduction in time. Since it was the first time using I think I was going slowly so the time may reduce more.- Changing water. It used less raw water than traditional mopping with a bucket. I usually use 2 - 3 more gallons traditionally mopping. This used about a gallon for the whole floor. So that’s a benefit. Only note is that because the container is smaller than my bucket I still needed to change the water 3 times. Which was fine with me.- I had no problems with streaking on the floors.  (Our tile is notoriously “streaky” and has caused more than one person to quit cleaning our floors because they were frustrated with how difficult it was to avoid streaks.).  I had virtually no problems. My only note is to make sure the mop roller is really damp/wet. In other words, you will need to go over a spot a number of times until the roller is wet across the entire length. (It took me less than 5 minutes with keeping the sprayer on. Also keep your finger on the “trigger” the whole time while cleaning.) - Floors looked clean and the waste water was almost black when changing the water so it does clean the floors. - Vacuum suction is good. This machine picked up hair, crumbs, etc with no problems. Even did a pretty good job against the floor boards and corners. (Mopping corners and floorboards wasn’t quite as good.)- It did great with tougher stains on the floor. Just need to go over the spot a few times to get it up.- Fairly easy to clean when done.Areas or Ideas for improvement: - The Bissell worked about the same on the grout as traditional mopping.  We have uneven grout that can stain and the Bissell struggled with our more problematic grout. It didn’t do worse than standard mop. However with a standard mop I can really scrub the grout with the mop head or “magic” erase pad.  So I will continue to carry and use an erase pad to get the bad grout stains.- Mopping the 1 inch next to the wall or carpet was a bit more difficult as I usually mop/vac parallel to the wall. With the Bissell I have to go perpendicular to the wall to get close.- I used the recommended amount of cleaning solution which is more than my old method so it may end up costing a bit more for cleaning solution. Worth it to me.",
mbp,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not that great of a cleaning machine,the United States,14-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I gave this an overall 2 because I saw that the dirty water that obviously came off my rug. When I used it on my vinyl floor and tiles, it was horrible. I think I may have gotten a defective model because it would leave puddles and not suction up (see the photos I provided). My vinyl floors were the same except by the time I did my vinyl floor, it started to leak and leave bigger puddles and not suction it back up. I ended up doing twice the work and had to steam and mop up all the liquid it left - muddy puddles. Everyone gave this suck a great review I guess they got a good unit that actually worked. Unfortunately mine didn't. I think I will go back to the Hoover which did a phenomenal job on my rug have to go back to steaming my floors again.",4
J. Wiitanen,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it for the most part,the United States,30-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am writing this review after owning the Crosswave for a couple weeks. I have 100% ceramic tile floors, so I can't tell you how it works on hardwood or other types of tiles.Generally speaking, this thing works pretty good. I use it a lot, because as anyone with hard floors can tell you, dirt shows up really well on them. The before and after every time I've used it so far is very satisfying.A few things I can say after having read reviews and Q&As prior to buying and after using it:1) Do yourself a favor and at least sweep up the larger dust bunnies and various detritus before using the Crosswave. It says this isn't necessary, but it really is. I'd say it's 50/50 whether the Crosswave will pick these up, and another 50/50 that it won't just move it to another spot on the floor. It depends what it is of course. Some things get picked up by the brush but then ""painted"" onto the floor elsewhere.2) Some people complained about this leaving wheel marks. This should be obvious, but anything you drag across a wet floor will leave marks. You just have to learn to use it in a way where the front of the machine is the last thing to pass over a given spot, instead of the rear wheels. Not rocket surgery.3) Some people asked if this will clean grout, and I was curious myself. I recently purchased my house, and the light grey grout was black. I didn't think this would tackle that, but if it did, that would be awesome. I'd already spent hours scrubbing the grout, so anything that might help would be a bonus. I tested the Crosswave on a section I hadn't done yet, and... goose egg. So no, this won't scrub your greasy grimy grout clean. However, on sections where I'd scrubbed and sealed, the Crosswave was able to remove dirt that had gotten into that grout. So I think this will help *maintain* cleaned grout. My grout lines are inset roundabout 1/8"" from the tile surface. If yours are different, your mileage may vary.4) This is billed as being good for hard floors and rugs. I tested mine on a large area rug with a medium pile. I was not impressed. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say it was good. Plus, a little dirt from the brush stained a small spot on the rug. Now, the machine does come with two brushes. So in theory, I could've used one for the rug and one for the tile (I at least waited for the tile one to dry). But realistically, there's no way I'm changing brushes between floor types for a thing that's supposed to be ""multisurface"", and doesn't work great for my carpet anyway. Maybe you will. I just know myself good enough to know I'm not willing to fart around with it. Fortunately, I still have a vacuum from when I lived somewhere with carpet.Overall, I'd say this is a really nice electric mop. It basically does the job a vacuum does for carpeted floors, but on tile/hardwood. If you keep that comparison in mind, and don't think of it as the equivalent of a steam cleaner or shampooer, I think you won't be disappointed.",
Kim,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, but the filter needs time to dry between uses",the United States,25-Nov-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The first day I had this, we dropped a jar of salsa on the floor. I picked up the big glass pieces and cleaned it right up.  My hubby then said, now we need to get a soapy rag to wash the floor. NOPE!!! This only uses clean/soapy water on the floor. It's continuously rinsing out the roller.  Later that same day the baby had and ""accident"" (I thing it was on purpose). The Crosswave to the rescue again!. The family is having a hard time understanding that this is washing the floor and not just wiping up the mess.  Its too easy. It can't possibly be as simple as pulling the trigger. If you go over it a few times without pulling the trigger, the floor is basically dry by the time you're done.  Many reviews say it doesn't get to the wall, and they are correct. It doesn't wash all the way to the wall, but it DOES vacuum to the wall. I just purchased a little floor vacuum about a month ago for the dining room, but the cord on that was only 15'. Not long enough to reach the end of our kitchen table (it's big, we have 5 kids). I cook at home every day, multiple times per day. Oatmeal or other hot breakfast cereal on the floor, daily.  Lunch is couscous, rice or spaghetti and  all of it is a sticky nightmare to sweep up. I had a spin mop I absolutely loved, but the handle went bad. $50 later, I bought a new one, that eventually died. I found a way to purchase just the handle straight from the company, but it was defective.  They replaced it for free, but the new one was defective too. I was at a loss. 5 young kids and 2 dogs, I needed a mop, but I can't keep paying to replace them and we were constantly sending the mop heads through the wash.  The Crosswave needs to be cleaned out when you're done, but the brush roll is basically dry when you turn it off and it has it's own drying stand. The only drawback I see is needing a second filter in the vacuum part, since it needs to dry out for a day before using it again. I can't go a whole day without washing something up! I wish I would have found this years ago! The price is a bit high considering I can get a carpet shampooer for $120, but it is so much faster and more effective than a mop and bucket. I don't regret purchasing this, just wish I wouldn't have spent the money on the other small vacuum since this does the same thing and more.",4

A. D. Perlman,5.0 out of 5 stars,A+ product - why did it take me so long to get a wet/dry vacuum???,the United States,4-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I feel like a new person with this machine. This is the first wet/dry vacuum I have owned so I can’t compare it to others. I am only using this on hard tile floors (my whole apartment is porcelain tile). Pros: easy to get use, lightweight, easy clean up and empty/refill process. The floor solution smells great (personal thing so can’t guarantee you will like it). I also used some Clorox bleach added to the water which works fine too. Easy to disassemble the brush for rinsing between uses. The dirty water is separate from clean. 2 modes “rugs” and “floor” the difference is the amount of water. The brush is very soft with a spiral of bristles which is good for those with hard wood floors. Cons: now that I have this machine I am thinking I wish I got one with more brush options. I wanted to use this on my outdoor tile deck (needs more water and stronger scrubbing brush). However, for those who need a smaller appliance that gets the job done I don’t think you will have any complaints. The most satisfying part is the disgusting dirty water that is evidence of how gross the floor was before you purchased this tool. I give it an A+ for all around design, size, use, effectiveness, etc...Edit after 45 days of use: I can’t live without this thing! I added photos to show how effective this machine is. The hair is from adults and kids (no pets) and the dirt is from 2,000 square feet of tile floor - and we don’t wear shoes in the house apartment!!! This is about 2 days of dirt (it is so easy to use I typically do the floor every day). Having bought this during Coronavirus lock down, it gives me such piece of mind to know how clean the house is for me and my family. Technical item: I prefer the “pet hair” multi surface brush. I bought a replacement brush to test if it was better - but like the one that arrives with the product. I got a replacement filter after doing a 1,500 SF stone tile balcony. Someone else posted that it doesn’t suck up cereal. I have used it on Cheerios, granola, spaghetti, orange seeds, etc... I have not had any problems with anything yet. A+!!!",One
Gary Goodnow,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ingenious Design – Incredible Cleaning Machine,the United States,23-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The title pretty much sums up my opinion and experience with my recently purchased Bissell Crosswave 1785.  It’s rare for me to be so impressed with a household appliance, and in particular floor cleaners, which I’ve not had stellar experience with generally.And this one is advertised to do both hard floor surfaces and rugs, but not carpet (more on that later).  The Crosswave is exceptionally engineered with BOTH the cleaning and user in mind.  From the time I started opening the box until the device was assembled and I began using for cleaning my porcelain tile kitchen floor was 15 minutes.  It is very well thought out and designed.  Although it comes with detailed instructions, this thing is designed so they are really not needed.  Everything snaps into place including the roller and cover and clean water and waste tanks.  And it even comes with a storage bottom tray the Crosswave fits neatly onto and it even cleans itself up to a degree – after use, just pour clean water into the tray, turn on the machine and the rollers spin and vacuums the water into the tank.  Then all you do is remove both tanks, dump the dirty water into the toilet or somewhere, do a final rinse of the roller and store it.  It makes some noise, but nothing unexpected for a combo cleaner/vacuum.  And on that note, it is not a dry vacuum and I will never use it as one.  It is a cleaner that vacuums dirty water from the floor as it dispenses cleaning solution.  Another huge feature is the long 25’ power cord which was long enough for cleaning every room without plugging into another outlet.How well does it clean?  Incredibly.  Usually when something is advertised to be dual or multi-use, you can expect one but not both to be high quality but in the case of the Crosswave, it does an exceptional job on both hard floors and rugs.  I was expecting mediocre on the rugs, but nope, it cleans them exceptionally well and makes them look like new.  The instructions clearly state it is for area rugs and not carpet but I used it on both with great results.  It made my area rugs look like new and I only used the multi-use brush.  I’m going to purchase the rug brush to see if it works even better.  And I have white carpet in my home office with low pile that was fairly dirty so I first vacuumed with my vacuum cleaner then used the Crosswave and was really impressed.  It is not longer a dingy white, but back closer to its normal color.  There are two switch modes, hardwood and rugs and it dispenses about twice the liquid on the rug mode, but my rugs and carpet were bone dry in 8 hours or so.  I suggest dry vacuuming after dry to make the pile stand up better.  Since my tile floors were pretty dirty, I used the rug mode for them the first time and it seemed to work a bit better in cleaning the ground in messes.  The second time I used hard floor mode and it worked great.  All my tiles are porcelain with shallow grout and it even cleaned the grout very well.  That was another issue some complained about.  And I couldn’t believe how filthy the water was in the dirty water tank.  The first time thru on the kitchen and entrance floors, there was a lot of gritty substance in the tank which I imagine was salt/sand still from winter that got tracked in and I never got fully cleaned with my throw away pad steam cleaner, which I’ll never use again.There is a lot of review mentions about streaking.  I had none on any of the tile floors, so I’m not sure what is going on with that topic.  But I did make multiple sweeps over the area so perhaps that helps.  I can’t think of any cons/negatives except perhaps they highly recommend using the Bissell cleaning solutions which are a bit pricey.  I’m not on much of a budget, so I’ll do so since they work sooooo well.  But you can do the math – I used about 3 oz per 130 sq ft.  I used the 8 oz bottle that came with the Crosswave the first day, but that was for two rooms of tile, and a couple area rugs.  One last thing.  My hardwood floors are not sealed, so I did not use it on them so cannot discuss that type of flooring.This is one of the best purchases I’ve made in a long while.",
A. Mushrush,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great but tank pieces keep breaking.,the United States,7-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really want to give this 5 stars. I love it. It’s all in one floor care! I can clean my entire downstairs floors and rugs with one machine in no time. It’s glorious. BUT there’s a piece that keeps breaking!!! It’s incredibly frustrating. The clean water tank is poorly engineered. I’ve had two different pieces to the tank break three times total. The cap, which is the unlabeled pic, has broken in this manner twice. The air valve flap (see labeled pic) broke once. Water kept leaking out when refilling it and I pulled on the valve to try to stop the leak and it pulled apart and off. But it was leaking before I ever broke the black rubber valve. The cap seems to just wear out. Eventually the screw just pops out. I read the directions and don’t see how I could be doing anything wrong. Another reason I give three stars instead of 1 or 2 is that Bissell has had sufficient customer service. It doesn’t take long for responses or to talk to a real person. The problem is this seems to be a problem that will keep happening! And what a waste of plastic! At this rate, this vac will be adding tons of unrecycleable plastic to the landfill 💔 I would love a solution to this that would fix the issue for good.",4
Karisa Rumsey,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am SO HAPPY I bought this!!!,the United States,25-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"You “think” your house is clean because you clean it, right? Wrong. My floors were GROSS looking at the black, cloudy water extracted by this machine. A few points to help others decide that YES the cost is worth the benefit.1. My downstairs is all real hardwood and white tile. It cleans both easily and dries VERY quickly without any streaks or film (using the Bissell multi surface cleaner). It didn’t scratch my floors or leave puddles.2. It cleans the surface of the grout on the tiles. I spent several days cleaning my grout with Clorox clinging gel bleach and that technique works beautifully. Then I cleaned my textured tiles with this Crosswave and it removed all the dirt stuck in the creases and grooves of the tile that I couldn’t even get with a scrub brush. No lie. It dried super fast and I applied a sealer over it. Now my 15 year old kitchen floors look brand new.3. Put a mesh filter or something over your sink because there will be hair in the dirty water tank that you don’t want clogging the drains. I vacuum before using this to minimize the hair and larger things that could get caught in the spin brush and scratch up my floors.4. Cleaning it afterwards is SO EASY! You just pour it out. So much better than hand wringing out a filthy mop! Reading through a few other reviews people said that after they cleaned it, the next use it leaked on the floor and the suction wasn’t as good. They didn’t put the filter back in. I know because I did it too. Remember to put it completely back together before using it and posting a review. A few of them even returned it! That’s funny5. The initial purchase included a small bottle of cleaning solution plus replacements for the filter and the spin brush! I was happy about that because I wasn’t expecting it.6. I have not used the area rug feature yet. I think it’s meant more for if you spill something on it rather than as a rug deep cleaner. I’ll let you know.7. Using different floor cleaners… let’s talk about this. The multi surface cleaner did a great job cleaning but not polishing the floors. I don’t want to put anything with build up in the machine. I plan to use it just for the cleaning. It makes the mopping part so easy and effective that the extra small step of polishing isn’t worth ruining the machine. I think any floor CLEANER like Fabuloso, Mr Clean, Zep, whatever would be fine. Using something like Mop and Glo might gum up the works… then you’ve ruined it forever.",
Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have!!!,the United States,30-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The struggle is real keeping floors clean with tile, kids, and dogs. I have been looking for something that cut some time out of my when it came to cleaning floors.* it vacuums, mops, and dries the floor all at the same time* it's light weight* easy to put toghter- took me 2 mins* easy to handle* cleaner smells goodAs someone that reads reviews before I buy, the good and the bad, I'm very happy with my purchase. No more mop buckets, towels, tip toeing over weight floor, and vancums. I no longer have threaten people with hard labor and bodily injury for walking on my just cleaned wet floors.",13
Tiffany R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!!! Worth every penny!,the United States,12-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So I must say Bissell has definitely made a vacuum game changer. I was very skeptical even after several friends had them I'm always the one to get the one that doesn't work. This I have owned for a half hour and I did my entire downstairs. Granted it's not huge home, vacuuming and mopping separately would take me about an hour to an hour and a half. I will keep updating as the months go by but so far so good.The package arrived and it did say Bissell crosswave on it so if you're in an area where that's not a good idea make sure you ask them to Rebox it in an Amazon box which is an option. But in the Box it came secure already put together except for you need to add the handle and the bottle that holds solution and water.It did a really good job sucking up hard to soft debris and scrubbing my tile and wood floors. It's as loud as any normal vacuum would be and all of the debris goes into one tank which if you're concerned about what's in the tank you can either dump it down the toilet or outside. Side note we do not have a septic system and have recently had our pipes redone so I know there are no blockages or anything like that in our sewer line. Another thing the blower is on the side of the vacuum which is nice it doesn't chase the hairballs away as you're trying to suck them up. And to be honest the suction is so good that I actually saw hair balls rolling towards me as I was coming through the room. And speaking of going through the room Bissell listened to several reviews and gave us a longer cord! The cord I received was just a substantial as on any vacuum.This is life-changing to anyone with a busy life. Again I have just received this item so I will keep you guys posted a month out a few months out so on and so forth but so far this is amazing and I'm very excited to see how much cleaner my house can be!",4
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT GET THIS- ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ANIMALS,the United States,14-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this vacuum thinking this would be the most convenient tool for house cleaning- I have a small two floor 1200 sq ft townhome and Im only using it on one level since I have carpet upstairs. I have a dog and a cat, both low shedders, and I clean my house from top to bottom once a week so I keep a pretty maintained home.Now that the backstory is out of the way- I used this vacuum a total of 5 times before I absolutely gave up on it. The first two times I used it I thought eh, it does the job just as good as a regular vacuum and a Swiffer wet jet and it saves half the time and trash so maybe it's a keepe. By the third time I noticed the intense mold smell the second the vacuum kicked on. I figured it was my own fault for now cleaning out the cannister (which really didn't have much in it tbh) and not changing it the rolling pad for the mop. When changing everything I got a good luck down the airway and was shocked at much wet animal hair and mildew was coating the mechanisms. Like, I only used it twice- you'd think I sucked up a bear or something. The smell stayed for two more uses even with me changing everything up. Then I noticed it wasn't as effective suction wise, I could be rolling over the same spot for 5 minutes and not take anything up. So I had to dismantle it again and clean it all out. Now it's been a month and some change and I can't turn it on without wanting to to barf.The smell of mold coming from the vacuum is so intense that it's spreading to other surfaces. This vacuum has ruined two area rugs: the water that was coming out (although freshly made in the reservoir with the provided cleaning agent) comes out brown and discolored the area rugs and made them reek of mold.Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Waste of time, money, and two good rugs.",
Lyce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,19-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Love it!  This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  I'm very particular about keeping my floors clean and I've rejected a couple of other products because they just didn't get my floors clean enough.  I called Bissell before I found this product and this is the only one (at the time I called) that actually said safe for Bamboo floors.  I have all Bamboo floors and tile in the bathrooms; it works great on both.  I have a Roomba that I run all the time, so I don't use the vacuum portion of this product as my main vacuum, but it works great for dust bunnies or pet hair.Pro tip1: don't let this guy get any pieces of cat litter - it will take you forever to clean the 'chalky' awayPro tip2: take the brushes apart every couple times you clean (I know it's kind of gross), you'll be thankful you didPro tip3: don't let your significant other put the dirty tank in the dishwasher for 'sanitizing'",6
kld4d,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does NOT clean well.,the United States,10-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was really excited to try this. With two dogs and a large luxury vinyl plank floored living area, I was hoping this would make my life a little easier. I was sorely disappointed. Here are the major problems with the machine and all of its related cleaners and heads:*Does NOT clean well. I have tried several different heads, both from Bissell and other manufacturers, hoping they would help, but this machine does not apply good pressure to clean puppy prints off the floor. Example: A drop of milk had to be gone over and over and over and over and over and over before it even started to disappear. There is a large gap in the middle of the swipe area that doesn't put enough pressure on the floor to make a clean swipe. You can see from the picture in the natural light how the brush does not apply even pressure, and this was a $29 pet brush from Bissell, not an off-brand. The original brush it came with left a 2-inch dry gap in the middle of the swipe.*2-inch gap between where the brush sort-of cleans and the wall. No matter which direction you turn it, it does not get anywhere near the edges. (See picture.)*If you have shedding dogs, you'll need to vacuum or sweep excess hair before you use the Crosswave. Hair gets in the brush, and it just spreads wet hair particles all over the floor.*All cleaning solutions leave a film. I tried two different kinds from Bissell, the pet solution and the multi-surface; both left a film and terrible streaks.*Very difficult to clean and takes forever to dry. Any time saved by not having to dump and refill mop water is used cleaning the machine out.*After about 20 minutes of use, it starts to spit out droplets of water, so you have to either start over with a new brush or come behind and mop up the wet spots.*And Lord help you if the machine tips over when you reach the end of the too-short cord. Dirty water spills out all over the floor you just worked so hard to get slightly cleaner.Bottom line: Save your money. Get a mop and bucket like the one from O-Cedar. It does a much better job, and it doesn't require electricity. It also gets the edges. You're going to have to sweep/vacuum before using the Bissell, anyway. You might as well just use a mop that will actually clean the floor.",
EC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it so far,the United States,9-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just finished cleaning my floors for the first time with this machine and so far, I'm happy with it.  Bissell says this is for hardwood floors but I'm using it ""off label"" for pine floors which are softwood and not hardwood.  So I recognize this is going against Bissell recommendations.  Anyway, here is why it works for my wide pine floors (in my opinion):  When you press the ""squirt"" button to add cleaning fluid/water to the floor, only a little fluid comes out at a time, which is good.  That way, I'm not drenching the floor in water and I have total control over how much water/cleaner is put down while using the machine.  There is much less water than what ends up on the floor when I use a bucket and sponge mop, and that's good because not only does it dry super fast, but I'm not saturating the wood with water.  For those who are torn between buying a cordless version or this corded version:  I bought the one with cord because I've had such terrible luck with battery longevity (on other brands).  At the same time, while using this machine, the cord can get a tad aggravating as with ANY vacuum cleaning type of machine, and it's no worse than other vacuums regarding that.  The odd part is, the cord comes out the lower part of the machine rather than the upper part of the handle, but maybe as I use the machine over time, I'll find out why.  NOTE:  Don't be dumb like I was, and run the machine over an electrical cord lying on the floor.  This machine is quite strong and sucked the lamp cord up and wound it around the brush and I had to stop the machine and slowly pull the cord out from around the brush.  My bad.  This machine transitions beautifully from cleaning the wood floors to quickly vacuuming the area rugs for a quick once-over.  It does a good job but I would not want to subject the machine to daily dry vacuuming of rugs (as opposed to c;leaning with water) because I think it would be hard on the machine.  In addition, my little Shark Rocket is great for area rugs and is a dream to empty--so easy.  I would not want to go through the emptying process with this one for just dry vacuuming.  But the point is, if you are cleaning your floors, you can run it across the carpets for a quick vacuum during the process and it's nice for that.  Now, I don't mean to sound like a totally scroungy slacker, but you should have seen the amount of dirt this machine picked up when I was done.  I had filthy water and an inch of mud in the bottom of the dirty water tank.  (Forgive me, father, for I have pets!)  :)",One
KayGee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Meh. Good and not so good,the United States,12-Jun-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Okay so I DO like this. First off, gross. Lol. All of that dirty water would of just been mopped around and then dried on the floor. Ew. I also like that I could vacuum and mop at once which makes the hard work worth it. Before I’d have to sweep and then mop, so that was a definite bonus. I agree with other reviewers that it would leave streaks, so boo. Maybe I’ll try wiping the bottom every so often. It might just be a build up of dirty water underneath. Also, I wish there was a way to scrub or to dispense more water for an area that is more soiled. This did not clean up my dogs drool spots, so after using this for 45 min I had to get out my bona floor mop for those areas... it might also be the cleaner. I may switch out the bissel cleaner and try my bona hard wood cleaner to see if it helps. I wasn’t as blown away and I had hoped but it does do the job.",2
Josh Newsom,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not very good,the United States,14-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"For starters I would like to say, if this was 200$ cheaper and marketed to only be a floor sweeper this would be an amazing sweeper. However it’s not, this so called vacuum/mop combo is by far the worst purchase I’ve made. For the price tag of 250$ it was a huge let down to see how it worked, does a subpar job at best at mopping and to get a decent clean you have to repeatedly go over the same spots. All in all I would pass on this product.",4
ME,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply Doesn't Do Anything Right (or at all, really)",the United States,10-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This thing is absolutely the worst and I'm so upset I spent so much on a useless pile of crap. It's not that mine is broken, everything seems to function as intended, it's just very poorly designed. It doesn't pick up anything in vacuum mode, it just pushes everything around both on our area rug and the hardwood floors. The wet mode certainly gets the floor wet, but the brush doesn't scrub up anything. You have to go through with a regular mop once you're done using it, Therefore negating the whole purpose. And boy is it a pain in the rear to clean after you use it in wet mode. The little bit of dirt it does pick up gets all over and you have to disassemble the whole machine to clean it all out. It's much more of a hassle than actually mopping. I think the people giving this thing 5 star reviews must be those folks with immaculate houses who clean everything 50 times a day and have no kids. They only think it's working because there's no dirt to pick up.I wish I hadn't stupidly waited until after the return period had ended before trying to return this thing. We've been Bissell fans for years and have enjoyed every Bissell we've opened except this one. They really dropped the ball here.",
Gary Yates,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best floor scrubber that I have used,the United States,13-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have been using a Hoover hard hardwood floor scrubber for the past two years. I had to replace it twice. When it failed again, I didn't want to buy a third one. The Bissell seemed to have good reviews, so I purchased this Bissell for my tile floors. The first time that I used the Bissell, I was pleasantly surprised. It works so much better for cleaning than the Hoover. I found that the fast spinning roller takes out dirty spots much quicker than the Hoovers slow rotating brushes and cleans deeper and quicker. I anticipated that the spinning roller would get caked with dirt immediately. What in actuality happens is that the fluid being dispensed on to the roller during operation not only is very effective in picking up dirt but keeps the roller wet which then allows the vacuum to remove the dirt from the roller. After cleaning floors, to my surprise, the water in the dirty tank is very dirty, but the roller is still pretty clean.I also find the Bissell to feel much lighter and quieter than the Hoover in operation.In comparison to the Hoover, the Bissell floor cleaner is lighter, quieter, cleans better and faster. I am hoping that it will also last longer that the Hoover. I should also mention that it is very easy to clean up after use.",
Richard Shroyer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, but a b**** to clean",the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this floor cleaner primarily to clean a very large linoleum kitchen floor.  It did a very good job - much better than what I could do on my hands and knees with two buckets.  Very little streaking and did well at cleaning spots where food had been spilled.  I also cleaned a small runner, and it did a great job; hasn't looked that good since it was new!  Life was great until time to clean up the machine.  I followed the instructions to the letter, and it took about the same amount of time as cleaning the floor had taken.  I've used it once since for hardwood floors, cleanup was faster since I didn't have to keep referring to the manual, but then you still have to wait for 24 hours for it to dry before reassembling.The other issue is probably my fault; I decided to use it to dry vacuum a large carpeted area.  About halfway through the area, it appeared to be pushing up clouds of dust as I moved it along.  I thought it was because my old vac had left so much dust behind that the Bissell couldn't get it all up and I'd need to go over it again.  What I discovered after I opened the machine up to clean it was that the filter (and pretty much every other area of the inside) was choked with dust, and that's why it appeared to be pushing up dust; it couldn't suck anything more in.  I've never owned a bagless vac; maybe this is just how they work.  But cleaning up the inside of the machine after dry vacuuming made cleaning up after a wet vac seem like a piece of cake.  What a horrible mess!  I'm going to stick to the Bissell for hard floors and area rugs and keep my old Hoover WindTunnel for the carpets.",
KME,4.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful little machine,the United States,24-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"First off, I just wanted to say that if you want your floors to look professionally cleaned, you need to hire someone to do it.  However, this machine does a pretty good job on its own.  We have tile floors throughout the house that are meant to look like wood and the tile isn’t perfectly smooth. Because of this the floors looked a little streaky after using the machine.  But I can’t complain about the amount of dirt and hair this thing sucked up off the floor.  It’s nasty to think we walk around on these floors in our bare feet.  Check out the photos, the canister is from just one area of my house (and I even sweep daily and use either a steam mop or Bissell Spinwave at least once a week). A lot of products will just push around dirt on your floor but this one sucks it up.  We have three dogs, two kids and live in dusty Arizona with a backyard pool.  Needless to say it’s hard to keep the place clean.Pros: Works well, dries quickly, meant for both hard floors and area rugs. Mops and vacuums at the same time.Cons: Floors a little streaky if tile is uneven, machine is loud like a vacuum, uses a lot of cleaner and water.Overall I’m happy with this floor cleaner and use it when our floors need a deeper cleaning.  Would recommend.",
SWR,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works Well, but Not as Easy to Use as Advertised",the United States,22-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have three dogs (husky, Pomeranian, and medium hair, medium sized mix), one husband,  no children currently living at home, and ceramic tile floors with area rugs. Before buying this vacuum, I had to clean the floor and area rugs in three separate steps: dry swiffer hard floors, vacuum area rugs, and steam mop hard floors. I was looking for something which would help me streamline this process. The Bissell Crosswave does that, but it isn't as easy to use as advertised. I've seen multiple negative reviews about pet hair clogs. It's true. The machine will eventually clog and require a clean out if there is a great deal of hair on the floor. Our dogs are brushed several times each week and I do use a dry Swiffer on days when I don't run the Crosswave....so....perhaps we don't have quite as much dog hair on the floor as some. Additionally, if you have thick area rugs which would hold a large quantity of hair, it might build up. Most of my area rugs are Ruggables, which can be put into the washing machine. They are typically not as thick. The Crosswave works well on them if I do not use the 'rug' setting. All-in-all, I am happy with the way this machine works. I've had it for about one month and am pretty much past the learning curve period. Be prepared to spend about 45 minutes cleaning and drying this machine after using until you have learned how to take the thing apart and clean it without looking at the instructions. Thereafter, it will require about 15 minutes for each clean out. If you have a larger house than mine ( 2400 sf), hairier occupants, or children who track in lots of mess, you might have to do this several times. That could add to your work significantly. I would purchase this machine again.",
ColetteP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for tile floors,the United States,6-Nov-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Recently received my Bissell Crosswave Wet Dry Vacuum.  So far I have used it only once but I am extremely happy with my purchase.  A large amount of my flooring is tile.  I had been using a Swiffer Wet Jet daily, and my floor never seemed to come out clean; the Swiffer does not remove debris from the grout between the tiles.  The Bissell, however, cleans and removes crumbs, dirt, dog hair, etc. from the grout.  After having just mopped my floor with the Swiffer and then using the Bissell afterwards, the water in the Bissell tank was black.  The floor looked and felt clean.  The Bissell obviously removes loose particles while also cleaning the floor.  You can control the amount of water (with cleaner) that you spray onto the floor, so you can concentrate on certain areas without soaking the floor.Cleaning the Bissell afterwards takes a little time, as the tank and the roller needs to be removed an thoroughly cleaned and dry before the next use.I did not try it on carpets yet.Definitely a good purchase.....I highly recommend the Bissell Crosswave!",
Lori Austin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not Perfect but Pretty Close,the United States,10-Nov-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical due to so many negative reviews but let me start by saying that I have health problems and pushing a mop is next to impossible for me. This isn’t heavy, is easy to assemble and take apart to clean. I thought my floors were pretty clean but after seeing the filth in the canister, I saw I was dead wrong. I had a few spots that I had to go back over a couple of times, but it did get them up. I have Chicago brick floors, wood floors, carpet and some tile and I can honestly say, it was a heck of a lot easier than mopping and the fact that i don’t even have to sweep makes it even better. The negatives...I don’t think it would clean really dirty floors and definitely not the greatest on a thicker carpet. It drinks up the cleaning fluid pretty fast, especially on rugs. I found that I kept turning it off due to the switches being on top of the handle. Other than that, I’m pleased with the results and the ease of use.",2
C. Keibler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised,the United States,4-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have now used my Crosswave twice.  I have to say, this exceeds my expectations!  We live out in the country in an old farmhouse.  We have hardwood and vinyl laminate throughout the house.  LOTS of the outside gets tracked in on a regular basis.  And we have a housecat who sheds copiously in the warmer weather.  The main floor is about 900 as ft.  Up until now I've been managing the floors through a combination of sweeping, vacuumi,g and mopping.  The results are often less than stellar.  The first time I used the Crosswave I had to empty the dirty water container twice and add fresh water once.  It was gross!  Black water, lots of debris and lots of cat hair.  When I was done I was very happy with how clean and steak-free my floors were.  The suction was able to pick up even the cat kibbles.  I was able to clean the area rugs by all the entrances.  The second time I was able to clean on one clean water canister and with no emptying of the dirty water.  Much less debris!  All the cat hair vacuumed up and, again, no streaks.  I recommend this labor saving device which lives up to its own hype!  My only regret?  I didn't realize there is a cordless version available!",
Grace B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s alright. Read below.,the United States,4-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I read a ton of reviews before I bought this and it was very very mixed. I then reached out to some people I know that have it and they recommend it highly soooo I went ahead a got it. Here’s what I think... I t’s ok..JUST OK. Especially for the price. Now mind you I have only used it once....  but maybe my expectations were very high.  But when I used it on my kitchen tile floor I had to go over dirty spots over and over again just to get them clean. I even had to scrape spots with my finger just to get it up. It took awhile. I guess I was thinking it was more heavy duty cleaning for the price I paid. But it did eventually do the job. It’s more of a light quick mop / with vacuum.  I will say however it is super easy to use and the cleaning was a breeze.For reference I did use the multi surface cleaner that came with it. Perhaps I will try a better solution and see if that helps.,3
K. Burns,3.0 out of 5 stars,An expensive wet mop,the United States,10-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am a self-proclaimed cleaning product geek and when I first saw this product (it was probably the new cordless, self-cleaning model), I did my research and decided I had to have it. I chose the cheaper corded model thinking there would not be much difference. I have tile and hardwood floors throughout much of my house and also have cats and dogs. I have previously used a Little Green to clean up pet stains, but liked this because it sweeps and wet mops as well. After a few months of using it, I find it a nice (but expensive) alternative to a plain old wet mop. It does produce a nice streak-free floor.  As for pet stains on carpet, I have tried different solutions, and for some reason , it doesn’t seem to clean as well as the Little Green (brush difference?).  The biggest complaint I have has to do with cleaning it after use. Let me state for the record that I normally have no complaints with maintenance on my appliances. I have a Roomba and clean it after every use and even break it down further every few months or so for more detailed cleaning. However this device is a pain. Even if you use it for a quick clean-up, you must thoroughly clean every part of it, or it will stink.  It accumulates a lot of hair and dirt in hard to reach places, like between the brush intake and holding tank. Perhaps the newer cordless, self-cleaning model has solved some of these issues, but I would think twice before buying it again.",One
AlpineTXGroomer,5.0 out of 5 stars,So close to perfect!!,the United States,4-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love Bissell products. In 30 years I've purchased 3 carpet cleaners, each one better than the previous ,still using the ""powerlifter"" for the carpeted portions, when I'm doing ALL the carpets. Just used the Crosswave last night, on my semi-rough sheet vinyl and low pile area rugs.  Today a construction worker's dog (used my doggy door) and 'marked' my bed, which dripped significantly on the carpet. Blotted the carpet with the a vinegar/water mixture (I have a new puppy also).  Since last night's area rugs came clean I decided to try the Crosswave for spot cleaning. I confess I used Bissell's pet solution, not the multi-surface trial product. SOOO, WHY I LIKE IT!. Smart design (easy to assemble, disassemble to clean, DON'T HAVE TO VACUUM first, lightweight, maneuverable, long cord, LOVE the CLEANING TRAY! Gets the pet hair (I have both cats and dogs). So much easier to clean than powerlifter, because the hair isn't trapped on the brush/roller (see pic). The only small issue, which isn't Bissell's fault, is that the wonderful suction makes it tricky to use on small area rugs. Works on wide runners, and 3x5 or larger just fine. Expect to use a little muscle on rugs, if that's an issue, get a robot.",
Bree,5.0 out of 5 stars,A key tool in the arsenal,the United States,30-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,My sister recommended I acquire this for a vacation rental property I own. I do the cleaning on the turnovers and it’s quite time consuming to clean the floors.  We are in a beach town so sand is an issue.Sand. Difficult to sweep.  Difficult to vacuum with a little hand held unit and the sand will fly everywhere when using a vacuum with a beater brush.However.  Because this unit wets the beater brush it doesn’t spray the sand everywhere.It picks up a lot of hair.  It grabs a lot of dirt.  The floors are noticeably cleaner.  It’s a time saver by combining the vacuuming and mopping in one.So. I had another rental unit change over and the cleaners wanted to charge me some crazy amount of money to “clean”.  The previous tenant had lived in the unit for 6 years as a family with dogs.  The floor needed some attention.  Both hard and carpet.  I picked up a 2nd unit that day (same as this one) and it cleaned up the floors like a champ!  Brought that unit home with me.I hated mopping.  I never minded vacuuming but I would take the box of spiders on my head before I would mop. By putting the mop in the vacuum I’m a happy lady with cleaner floors.,
Elle Kay,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would love to love it but I can't!,the United States,26-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this in hopes of making my life easier. In theory, it's a great concept! Who wouldn't want to clean and wash their floors at the same time? It would be great to wash and dry your dishes or wash and dry your clothes at the same time too, but in reality we just aren't there yet. I does an okay job. It's fine for quick pick-ups when you don't have time to deep clean, but it doesn't get up close to baseboards and edges and if you have pets, there's a disgusting message of wet hair that you have to remove from the canister. I think there are some things Bissell can do to improve this:•  Make the cord at least 6-8 feet longer (My 1st level is about 950 square feet and I have to move it around to do the whole floor).•  Offer a removable hose with an attachment to vacuum along baseboards, edges, under furniture and stairs.•  Re-design the handle mobility so you can create a lower profile to clean under furniture and beds. Right now I can't get it low enough to get under anything.•  Ideally, the wet and dry canister chambers would be separate.C'mon Bissell, you can do it! I'm rooting for you. I want this to work for selfish reasons.All this being said, I paid about $200 for this on a special. I think it was a pretty fair price, but I wouldn't pay more than that in my opinion. Hope this review is helpful.",One
Jeff L,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this for my tumbled travertine kitchen floor!,the United States,9-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We had a tumbled travertine kitchen floor installed in 2015. Never again!  What a pain to keep clean. Cannot just mop it. Had to get down on my hands and knees not necessarily to wash it but to vacuum up the water from washing it. Otherwise, the dirt and dirty water just accumulated in the holes and crevices making the floor look filthy. I saw this machine. Read all the questions/answers and finally decided to take the leap. I figured if it did t work, I would just send it back. This baby is going nowhere!  I can now wash my kitchen floor while at the same time vacuuming up the dirty water all in one step. I was afraid this machine would not have enough sanction to get the water out of the holes and crevices, but no problem. What use to be a 4 hour job (I’m no spring chicken) now takes me about 30 minutes.",One
Edward Barnett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beats a mop and bucket hands down. Floor scrubbing with no more effort than vacuuming.,the United States,19-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I looked at this CrossWave floor cleaner for over a year before buying. It got good reviews, but was also pretty expensive, so I just kept using my mop and bucket. Then one day in April they had a special price of $30 less than normal, so I took the plunge and placed the order. Having now used the CrossWave, I wish I'd bought it a year earlier. The machine uses much less water and cleaning solution than a mop and bucket since it sprays on just a thin film then sucks it up. The floor doesn't get as wet as with a mop, and it drys fast. The dirty solution goes into a different tank, so the floor is always being cleaned with fresh cleaning solution, a big improvement over a mop and bucket. I used the CrossWave on what I thought was a pretty clean tile floor and the dirty water tank was black. The spinning brush does a great job of cleaning tile, including doing pretty well on the grout lines (much better than a mop). Sometimes machines like this make cleaning faster, but then burn up all the time savings by being hard to clean. I was glad to find that this machine is very quick and easy to clean. Bissell thought of a clever way to clean the inside tubes -- you just fill the included tray with fresh water then put the machine in it and turn it on. The CrossWave sucks up the clean water and it rinses the innards as it works its way to the holding tank. Clever. I'm always worried about scratching our tile, so I ordered the softer brush separately -- it doesn't have stiff scrubbing bristles mixed in. This is a great addition to the cleaning arsenal. Almost as easy as vacuuming, and a whole lot easier (and cleaner) than the old mop and bucket.",3
Humpmeimapilot,5.0 out of 5 stars,Muddy backyard? Muddy dogs? 90 days of rain and hardwood floors? Buy this!,the United States,30-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We live just south of Memphis, TN. It has been raining for, oh I dont know, 3 months or so. Our backyard is a disaster and full of mud. We have 2 dogs that go in and out several times an hour. We tried keeping up and wiping then off. That lasted a week. Then we started using a mop and a Bona wet sniffer mop. That lasted about 3 weeks.I saw a commercial for the model 1 up from this one and thought, oh my. I've used it 10x so far and it is wonderful. The floors are spotless and the hair and grass are gone too.If you are thinking of buying this product I will suggest 1 thing. Even though this wet/dry vacuum does well with pet hair and debris, save yourself some minor headaches cleaning the unit afterward by running a regular vacuum first. You absolutely do not have to, but cleaning out the brush and tank afterward is kinda gross. I like to just spray it out with a garden hose or sink. Dont rinse hair and whatnot down your kitchen sink unless you want a plumber bill.All-in-all this Bissell is a life changing experience with muddy dogs. Even if you didnt have the mud or dogs and you have a ton of hardwood or non carpet floors, this Bissell will cut clean time down significantly.",One
Nick F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy this.  I have a lot of hardwood floors,the United States,12-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've been searching for a product to help clean the floors in my home to replace an older hoover floor mate that I loved but hated at times.  I have a significant amount of oak hardwood floors.  Swiffer type of products do not work for the space and pushing mops that just move dirt around is not what I want.  I am extremely happy with this product.  I can clean the floors faster than before.  With a toddler, I've used this about 6 times now for the 1-2 months I've owned it.I like that the solution seems pumped and you can see it in the lit solution tubes, not gravity fed, guaranteeing consistent solution delivery.  Its small and light to maneuver  for tables and chairs. The ""dry"" mode seems good to spin the roller while not delivering solution.  Its leaves the floor minimally wet to dry but doesn't seem to allow moisture into the board joints.I like the tray to clean the brush and removing the roller to dry is very easy and quick to maintain.The only downside, it will not clean the less than 1 inch of space at the edges for baseboards.  I do find that difficult dried food is not easily removed -- so I carry a credit card to help scrape.",2
Abbott,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t recommend this because it is too hard to get in a new roller and then quits sucking water.,the United States,5-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"When I first got it, I loved it.  But it has a very shrill noise, so needed earmuffs.What I didn’t like:  it’s messy, kind of nasty to have to take it apart or work on clearing any plugs of dirt caught in it.  I would try to do it in my bath tub.  The real bad part was putting on a new roller.  The roller, of course, gets mildewed after a while.  I bought new filters and stocked up on rollers.  But after changing the roller the first time, it really never worked the same.  I’m fairly mechanically inclined, and my husband is, too.  We just could not get it to pick up water once we changed the roller.  So darned aggravating.  In the beginning, I would have given 4 stars at least.  Not now.",One
Maggie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing to brag about,the United States,7-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"For background, I previously purchased the Bissell Crosswave Cordless Max. That machine was great in that is separated the hair from the dirty water, it had a self cleaning option (which isn't that different than how you clean the Bissell Crosswave All In One), and the Cordless Max had a bluetooth connectivity option to track when you clean it, etc. The downfall of the Max was that when you picked it up after cleaning your floors, it would leave a puddle where it was. The All In One doesn't seem to do that.The Bissell Crosswave All In One got the job done. It sucked up hair, dirt, and even bigger pieces of dirt like mulch. The big differences between this and the Cordless Max are the hair catch tray and self cleaning. I, however, like the All In One's cleaning better because you can clean it in its tray as long as you'd please, whereas the Max self cleaning cycle is only about 15-30 seconds. In addition, the All In One is not cordless. I like that because I feel as though the suction and brush work harder when powered by an outlet versus a battery. That would also make a difference if you're cleaning a bigger house versus a small apartment like myself.The downside was that there is about an inch and a half on either side where it doesn't clean, meaning it won't get right up against the baseboards of your walls and clean flush against the wall.The All In One retailed for about $250, but I was able to purchase it for about $137 because I had a credit on my account from a previous return. Otherwise, I don't believe it's worth the $250. Yeah, it gets the job done, but I personally don't feel it's worth $250.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,the United States,2-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this product with the hopes I could replace some of all the other products I currently have to clean my floors. I was unimpressed with the steam option, my floors looked the same after I “steamed” them as they did before and dirt from shoes even stayed on the floor after I was done. The suction of the vacuum is clearly not very powerful. Furthermore, there are no attachments, so all creases at the walls were still littered with pet hair and dirt that this vacuum could not reach. Therefore I had to get out the broom and swiffer sweeper to complete the jobs on the hardwood.So then I tried it on my carpets in the living room, again, it had trouble picking up dirt from the rug. My daughter had remnants of Yard from a craft project that I wanted to vacuum up since they were super small and all over the rug. I had to go over the area multiple times to make this vacuum pick them up. They were smaller and lighter than a dime. So yet again, I had to get my regular vacuum out to complete the job.Also, the thing goes through solution very quickly, you will need more than the sample bottle if you have a large house to do one pass through. There is also no button to release the handle, you have to step on the bottom and push down on the handle to get it to release, which I feel like will cause the lock to break more easily in the future.Only positive of this machine was the light weigh to be able to carry it up and down the stairs and be able to actually wash the stair rugs. Still did not get in the creases and had to follow up with the vacuum attachment to complete the job.Overall, not impressed, I wanted to like this but just too many things that weren’t thought of or are poorly made. I will be returning, too expensive to not do what it advertises.",2
sally fb,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I would return if I could......OK as a Vacuum, Terrible as a Wet Mop.",the United States,16-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Bissell only allows returns for unused, new condition!

I felt guilty using ""one use mopping pads"" and figured I'd save some money and the planet.

HDN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well made and easy to use,the United States,29-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had a Spinwave first, and liked it, but  didn't want to have to clean up the dirt after it was scrubbed off the floor. The Crosswave does that quite well- it's a little shocking to see just how dirty your floor was by looking at the dirty water container. Bissell's designers did a really nice job of engineering parts so they lock together  with a snap (and you can't mess up); they have designed places for the cords,  they include a quick start list, understandable use directions, a tray to store the cleaner and dry the spinner, an extra filter, and the floor cleaner arrived in perfect condition, due to the impeccable custom fitted  and well thought out packing materials. Good thing, because some packer at Amazon packed a 64 OZ bottle of cleaner  in a bigger box  along with the Crosswave container box, with nothing to hold it from slamming around during shipping.This is a well designed and constructed machine. Very happy with it.",2
THOMAS FLENTIE,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dont throw away your mop,the United States,21-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes for this in the beginning but after several months I""m forced to stop lying to myself and admit this thing is kinda of terrible. As a vacuum it works great and it does an alright job of cleaning carpets but it fails when it comes too hardwood/tile. You will end up going over the same section 5-6 times and finally just use your fingernail to take to spot off. If your floor is free of foreign debris then this works great but if there is some small piece of food that has fallen and been stepped on it wont take it off. If your constantly spilling your cereal for some reason then yes it will pick that all up and leave it clean just make sure to immediately disassemble and rinse and dry the removable parts are they will become moldy and have spots all over them. The only reason this got 2 stars instead of 1 is that the vacuum works great and if you lived in a cramp studio i can see having this instead of a mop and vacuum. In conclusion i would just stick with the mop (studio permitting) and just deal with scrubbing it yourself instead of buying this noisy floor scrubber/vacuum/carpet cleaner that needs its own special fluid.",One
Jack D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for laminate Flooring,the United States,9-Nov-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the exact machine/performance I was looking for.  If you have or had laminate flooring, you know how disastrous standing water can be on the edges of the laminate panel edges; they delaminate.  I wanted a machine that would mechanically wash the floor with water or solution and then immediately vacuum up the water so it wouldn't have time to soak into the edges, soak in, and cause delamination.  This does exactly as I wanted!  It sprays a light spray, the brush scrubs the floor, and the vacuum removes almost all of the spray, just leaves a fine damp layer that quickly evaporates.  Done!  It will leave a bit of an ""edge"" or line on either side of the machine, but some overlapping when sucking the water/solution up mitigates the issue.  I've been using straight RO water from the RO drinking water system I have at the kitchen sink, which leaves virtually no streaks or ""edging"" when it evaporates.Machine disassembles and cleans up easy, or you can clean without disassembly with using the cleverly designed storage stand.Great contraption!  Fast, effective, works as advertised.  Highly recommended if you want to keep your laminate clean and minimize the risk of delamination at the edges.  Gitcha one!",3

I've seen reviews that said it left the floor wet or streaky but that is not the case with my experience, you hold the trigger to release liquid for a couple of passes over the floor then you go a couple passes without the trigger. If you want it to be even more dry, you just go over without pulling the trigger until you are content. My floor was decent vacuumed but we have indoor dogs and 4 kids and this thing sucked up so much hair and dirt it was crazy. It's so easy to use and clean that I will use it on a regular basis.

Ruth,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not strong enough to clean up after slobs.,the United States,28-Jun-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I like that it puts the cleaning solution down and sucks it back up so you are cleaning with clean solution and not smearing dirt around. However, we have a farm and the brush does not scrub well enough to get the grime off the floor. It takes forever and several passes to really get it clean. Maybe we are just slobs, but I need something for my hard surface floors that will scrub harder. I haven’t tried it in the oak floors yet.It is easy to disassemble and clean. Lots of parts to let dry, but simple enough. I like that you can change the brushes for different kinds of floors, but they aren’t very different from each other. It needs a firmer brush for the vinyl and tile floors. The tanks only cleaned half of my kitchen before needing to empty the dirty tank and refill the cleaning solution.  I must need a commercial model. Lol.",One

I have used swiffer mops, microfiber mops and regular cloth mops(shaggy dog looking), they seem to smear and relocate the dirt/hair. I sweep prior to vacuuming to reduce it from clogging but I shed worse then a dog in the summer's heat(due to pregnancy hormones). The cleaning agent has a mild fragrance unlike swiffer which seems overpowering and mask odor rather then clean. Swiffer also tends to leave a sticky residue on my floor as well as other cleaners like Fabuloso, I haven't noticed any film or stickiness whilst barefoot. This vacuum is light and durable. I knocked it over because I didn't allow it to ""click"" into standing position. I didn't notice any leaks from either tanks. The vacuum isn't as loud as other brands allowing my 5 month old to sleep through my cleaning, thankfully. It was a very easy transition from tile to rug with a slight lift. It cleaned my textured rug very well, although I had to go over it couple of times because it's at my front door where we take our shoes off. Super easy to assemble and clean all parts.

Kristen L.

It leaves my vinyl kitchen floor much wetter than the wood floors. I don’t know why.It’s easy to clean, but there is still a process and I haven’t figured out the best place to empty the dirty water, because it also has a gross collection of hair and small pieces of dust and other debris at times. We don’t have a slop sink. That would be the ideal place. The water and debris isn’t easily separated and it’s too liquidy for the trash can.

I’ve tried different cleaners, flooring systems, nothing worked on all surfaces and I constantly fought streaky hardwood. Someone recommended the Crosswave to me which I’d never heard of. After some research, I skeptically ordered. I wasn’t convinced the multi surface cleaner would actually work on my wood floor, but it does! I can go from surface to surface without changing cleaners or swapping household appliances. I was certain the vacuum wouldn’t hold up to my beloved Shark I’ve faithfully used for the past few years. It vacuums amazingly. I’m so happy with my purchase and use it daily, the kids and pets give me new reasons to constantly utilize my Crosswave. I do wish it had a hose though, probably the only negative I can say so far. WORDS OF WISDOM: dump the wet/dry canister after EVERY SINGLE USE. I showed my Mom how awesome it cleans (she is now purchasing her own) and got busy forgetting to dump the canister. Ugh. Just don’t do it.

I have 3 dogs and 4 kids, and live in SoCal, so the dust is unbelievable.I was very scheptical about it as I’ve tried other similar devices unsuccessfully. I was in for a good surprise. This actually works well, i got worried when I saw how small it is, but the vacuum part is very powerful and it sucks in the water perfect so you don’t end up with soaking wet floors with dirty water, because of the two tank parts. I did have to go slowly because my floors were very dirty as my other vacuum broke a couple of weeks ago, but still was able to vacuum the entire house in about half the time I would if I swipe, vacuum and mop. I hope it stays as good for a while.For rug areas didn’t feel as good, but i had the all surface brush, I ordered the one for carpets only and hope it will be better. Also I loved the cleaning fluid, my kitchen is tile and the only product that will clean it good has been dish soap, the Bissell liquid worked wonders and it wasn’t sticky after and very shiny.I definitely recommend this vacuum.",4

Gamecrazy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok but nothing to write home about,the United States,14-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It works, but how well it works against the competition I can't answer. I bought it as a power mop not for regular vacuuming. I have a Dyson which is pure awesome, so I will just rate the mop feature, other than to say the vacuum works ok. On that note though, my Dyson has actually sucked the paint off a cabinet, so enough said about that. Regardless of what others some say about this not leaving streaks, they are wrong or delusional. Brand new and cleaning the brush it left streaks, which means either it's not picking up all the dirt or or is residue from the water and solution. If the sun shines on the floor you will notice it. I've used it several times with the same results. I'm beginning to think a mop and bucket are probably just as good and a heck of a lot faster. Not one of the cheap Walmart special mops either, but the industrial ones like the janitorial sevices use. 5 stars for the cleaning solution though just for the smell.",
Clarks Fan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worthwhile Purchase,the United States,18-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had a Hoover Floormate for many years and totally loved it.  However I broke it -- my fault!  According to what I read on Amazon, they have had problems lately so a friend recommended the Crosswave.  The Floormate with stiff scrubbing brushes cleaned the floor slightly faster but that said, the Crosswave gets the floor dryer, faster.  I have 3 expert dirt tracking in dogs and this just works.  I may have to move it a little more slowly in some spots.  Yes, I get a cannister full of mud at the back door!  My floor comes out very clean and I am happy.  My floor dries more quickly than it used to with the old Floormate too.  The vacuum action of the Crosswave is slightly superior.  Lots of dog hair lives here you know.  I am very happy with this machine so far and never ever, ever, want to go back to the old mop and bucket!  The Crosswave is lighter weight than the old Floormate, easier to steer around the room and frankly I will probably use it more often than I did the Floormate just on ease of use alone.",
Debsmusings,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to clean machine. Problems are not well supported. Bissel customer service is poor.,the United States,30-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The machine worked off the bat as I had hoped but it doesn't suck up the fluid as well as it should. The machine is a pain to clean if you want it to really be cleaned. If you are okay leaving it constantly dirty you might not be bothered. I had a problem with the brush roller window being stuck so that I struggled to open it for cleaning. I called and called and they replaced the window part but it didn't fix the problem. I called again and again and emailed back and forth on this. Their support is infuriating. I am still waiting to get my problem address. Good concept. Terrible reality.,One
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Corrupt Reviews,the United States,1-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The company must have made their employees post reviews. Let me tell you. This vacuum does not work. It is impossible for it to work. The way it is made makes it literally impossible. The plastic tube that connects the vacuum to the bag is too small and curves too abruptly. This, paired with the suction being too low and the bits you’re vacuuming being moist since you are mopping at the same time, creates a build up right away. None of the contents actually make it to the bag. None. You get to vacuum for as much as that little tube can hold. Which is about five minutes. Then you have to open everything up and clean out the tube, which falls out everywhere all over the floor and gets all over the outside of the vacuum. DO NOT listen to these good reviews. They are 100% a lie. I had to throw my vacuum away after one use and waste all this money.",
Cindy P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Floor Cleaner,the United States,19-Aug-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If I could give the Bissell CrossWave 100 stars I would.....true story! My house is 75% tile and 25% carpet. I live on 10 acres in the Pacific NW and get every kind of weather. I have a contractor husband, 4 grandsons, a dog and cat. My floors are constantly covered in dirt and debris. I have tried different machines and mops over the years but the CrossWave is by far the winner.Here's why: Lightweight and easy to maneuver  Swivels and gets into smaller spaces and corners  Really easy to fill clean water tank  Also easy to clean dirty water tank  Cord is a good length  The dirty water tank doesn't have strange hidden areas that collect dirt and pet hair that you can't get to  and clean  The brush is a combo brush/mop design that works really well  Easy to dismantle and put back together for cleaning  Good water conservation  So Happy with this purchase!",2
Elizabeth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Does it's job well, but you'll spend time later cleaning the item itself",the United States,12-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I like this because it makes easy work of my wood floors, and I actually feel like I get them clean.Cleaning this tool itself, however, takes time and effort. I like that I can clean my floors and put this away when company comes, and then clean the brush and chambers later. For my needs, this balance makes this a great tool.The commercials on TV show this item picking up egg shells, cereal and big messes. Just so you know, that's not going to happen in real life. This is meant for cleaning every day crumbs and debris, not massive spills. You'll still need a good ol' fashion mop and broom for that.When my toilet overflowed, I was able to clean up the water super quickly by running this without any cleaning solution in the chamber. In that moment, this tool was a godsend and worth every penny.Pro tip: you cannot leave solution in the chamber because it will leak. If you don't use all of the liquid when you clean, pull the bottle off the machine and store it under the sink so you don't waste the solution.",3
April J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best investment ever!,the United States,31-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I did a lot of research before I purchased the crosswave. I have two naughty puppies that mark all over the house. They have been banished to the kitchen, and I'm too old and lazy to get on the floor and clean it. When I use a mop, it just spreads it all over the place. With the crosswave, I can scrub, clean and suck up the mess. The bristles even get into the grout lines and cleans that up too. I love the fact that it's a vaccuum as well. I just go over my kitchen floor and it picks up all the dog hair, dust and grass they bring in through the dog door. I take it apart after I use it and clean it out thoroughly. It's very easy to clean, and the hose that goes from the machine to the cup is very short, so if something were to get stuck, it's very easy to clear it out. I love how easy it is to use, and my 11 year old is a pro at it. The only thing I wish it did was get up against the wall better, however, if the only thing I have to do is take a rag and run it around the edge of the floor, I can't really complain.",2
neworleansnative73,5.0 out of 5 stars,ATTN Clean Freaks: this is a game changer,the United States,22-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I received this a few days ago after moving into a house with nothing but brick and hardwood floors. It was recently renovated and covered with construction dust and mess. I tried a combination of vacuuming, sweeping, wet and dry swiffering, hand washing and scrubbing, and steam mopping. It all seemed inadequate and in desperation, I ignored the negative reviews and bought the Crosswave. So far, I love it. It vacuums AND mops at the same time and fills the used water tank with nastiness. The floors feel clean under my feet. My only gripe is the laborious clean up afterwards, but it is absolutely worth it. The real test will be whether or not it will last. So many appliances and electronics break within a year. If I this happens, I will update my review.",
Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! It's excellent!!!,the United States,31-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My tiles were dirty and nothing was cleaning them. I thought I needed a professional- I was wrong!!! This did it in seconds!!! Wow!!! The solution plus the rotation head broke up the dirty immediately! My only complaint is that it's a little heavy, but not much! It works like a charm! After I use it, I wipe the floor with a paper towel and it's not dirty! It's always a little dirty after a regular mop! This is a product that does what it says!! I'm really, really shocked!",One
PixieVomit,2.0 out of 5 stars,NOT WORTH THE PRICE. Not hassle free!!,the United States,23-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So I had really high hopes for this vacuum. I have a 70lb rough collie who sheds like crazy in thick tufts that become like tumbleweeds in the house. I’ve never had a really nice vacuum and thought I’d treat myself and buy this. I tried it dry first haven’t tried the wet yet but I can already tell it’s the same bs I’ve had with other vacuum’s: all the hair just twists around the roller and not actually getting sucked up. It was so bad that in the first 5 minutes of use I could smell like a plastic or rubber type smell burning from the hair being caught around the roller. So no big deal, right? Removable roller! Nope! You remove the roller and now it doesn’t suck up ANYTHING! You’d think for this price and appraise online that at the very least it can do what my 20 dollar hand held vac does: pick up lightweight tufts of hair. Nope! Not even enough suction for that. I’m hoping I like it when using the mop option but my bar is set low now and I’m honestly upset. Another thing is that the dust chamber is INCREDIBLY small if you have multiple pets and even just medium sized floor space you will need to empty the chamber at least 2 or 3 times because it will not stay on if the chamber is full. Lastly, the vacuum is heavier than most which is strange because it’s fairly small, so moving around was difficult and it doesn’t make as smooth of turns as was advertised. So all in all not a great vacuum for long pet hair, which in my opinion means it is not pet friendly. Not efficient in the least, and I’m pretty disappointed with this purchase.Update: used it for mopping and at first I was happy with it. Then it shuts off after not even five minutes! It did this during the dry run as well, just shuts off after five minutes. IN WHAT WORLD is it “easy clean up” if I have to get on my hands and knees every five damn minutes to detangle this roller just so the stupid vacuum will work for another five minutes?? And add on the fact that it wasn’t SO bad to do this when it was dry but wet?!? TERRIBLE. Keeping my business with SHARK from now on since I’ve never had an issue with their products.",One
Susan Malfer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic!,the United States,18-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I read reviews about streaking, but then read a review from a professional on the Crosswave all in one and decided to get one. Well cleaned my house this morning and the Crosswave arrived this afternoon so as with all new toys decided to try it out. I'm MORTIFIED! I thought my house was clean until I used this. This Crosswave sucked up so much dirty water from wood floors and area rugs that I will most likely be using it for the next few days until I only get slightly grey water. I should also add that we have two large bred dogs that like coming in and out of the house numerous times a day. I was going to post a picture of the dirty water but it was too gross, also this was so easy to clean. If you have pets and/or children you will love how easy it is to get a clean house using the Crosswave All in One for area rugs and hardwood floors.",
lily,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came packed very well and easy to set up,the United States,18-Oct-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Came packed very well and easy to set up. Took only 5 minutes. I started cleaning my tile floors. I sucked up nearly all the water and the floor became dry in minutes. After drying the tile looked clean and the grout never looked better. Very impressive. I then turned it loose on my wool entry rug and wow what a job it did. I couldn't believe the dirt that lived in that rug. After the job, I found it easy to clean up and detail the parts. This took me about 10 minutes total. The only problem with the CrossWave was the inability to clean close to the edges. It leaves about and inch or two uncleaned. I can live with that and touch up by hand. It is not a fast mop machine. I have 2000 square feet of tile. I worked on my kitchen, dining room, and traffic areas, about 800 square feet. this took me around 20 minutes. I think, all things considered, this device does a  very good job if you don't try and rush. I don't normally give reviews on stuff but before buying I read a ton of the bad reviews but bit the bullet anyway. Take the leap, you won't be sorry.",4
Emily,4.0 out of 5 stars,Practice makes perfect,the United States,2-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I wanted a new floor cleaner because swiffer wet pads left my floors looking worse than they were originally. I used this for the first time and the initial use was okay, but after using it for a second time I really like this machine. I understand why people are saying it leaves streaks because it can look like it, however, it looks to be wheel marks.We have weird laminate wood floors in our rental and they have a film on them that always looks gross. After using this twice, I’ve been able to get the floors to actually look clean! Also, I do not recommend this for area rugs. It made my white Persian rug look darker than it did before I used it. Also not a fan for our area rug in the living room.Overall, after reading some best use tips in the user manual and online, I found that if you actually read the product manual, it helps you use the product better! For wood floors I find going over an area a few times with the solution flowing, and passing over that area a few times without solution gets the best clean/leaves little marks behind. Overall I wouldn’t rate this 5 stars because I don’t think it’s mind blowing but it definitely works.Also, taking it apart to clean is way simpler than I thought, and this feels like a high quality product.",
Wesley T. Brown,1.0 out of 5 stars,It doesn't live up to the hype.,the United States,8-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I got this vacuum so that I wouldn't have to vacuum THEN mop.  I have tile floors everywhere except 2 upstairs bedrooms in a 2500 sq. ft. home. I have 2 cats and a 90 lb. Rottweiler/German Shepherd mix. Where do I begin? This vacuum doesn't release the cleaning water mixture evenly...at all. It comes out streaky or it pours out. Everywhere you stop, slide, or move the vacuum after getting some cleaning mixture on the floor, it leaves a dirty streak or spot when it dries. It didn't matter how fast or slow I vacuumed, it left dirty streaks. Very frustrating. The cord is attached at the bottom of the vacuum so I'm constantly holding the cord and pulling it back in towards me to keep from running over it.  If used on a medium/heavy piled rug/carpet, it gets clogged up almost immediately. Useless. The only good thing I can say is it is easy to take apart and put back together.If I had seen this vacuum used in someone's home first, I would not have wasted my money on it.NO, I would NOT recommend this vacuum.",
Teach,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Convenient, light, great maneuverability, but tips",the United States,22-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I like this Bissell. But it does require a fair amount of emptying and you have to clean the roller after every use. The rollers only spin in “Rug” mode - and not too fast. The floor mode works more like a mop without being able to scrub hard.I like that it picks up dirt that you don’t have to vacuum up first. But it gets very messy with chunks of dirt, dog hair, etc mixed in the dirty water. Where does one dump that?I usually have to fill and empty at least twice for my kitchen floor.The roller comes out pretty easily for cleaning although it has gotten stuck.  The handle is tall enough for my 5’8” self. It is lightweight and easy to move. It has great maneuverability.Con:  it tips over easily! Make sure it clicks in place or the dirty water will spill out.",One

I am amazed at how much time and back ache this is going to cut out for me. It took me all of 20 minutes, start to finish to do my entire 1st floor home.As I said I have 3 dogs but the real one that causes me the most work is my malamute because she constantly sheds and she will blow her full coat 2 times a year, and oh the hair!

Sandra Fairbanks,3.0 out of 5 stars,Clean it out EVERY time,the United States,6-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE, FYI this is to be used like a rug scrubber, clean it each and every time, which is something I didn't do.  Second, The water tank and the hair all go into the same trash, so make sure you have a place to dump, VERY dirty, hairy, water. I UP'ed the rating, because when you clean it after each use it works pretty well.  I rated this one star because IF you use the wet and dry you need to clean when you are done.  I bought this for the eases of cleaning my new hardwood floors.  Well it does a good job, BUT the dirt and hair get stuck in the portion between, (neck), as you see in the pictures.  You need to stick something in there to clean it out, my fingers only reach so far, butter knifes don't bend, so it wasn't much help, but I finally did get it all cleaned.  I have a dog, so there is a lot of dog hair.  I didn't clean it out the last few times I used it.",2

I wiped up my tile and swifflered my laminate floors then I mixed up the solution and did it all over again using BISSELL Crosswave All in One Wet Dry Vac.  I couldn't believe how dirty the water was that came out of the waste reservoir !!I the washed my area rugs.  They came a little cleaner but this works best on the floor.  I also used it to vacuum the carpet in my bedrooms, without dispensing any cleaning solution.  That worked as well as my regular vacuum sweeper !!What impressed me most is that when I wiped the floors there were always smears and streaks there is no streaking when you use this.  It puts just enough cleaner down and it vacuums it up clean enough that there is nothing butshine left.  This is an amazing vac !",
GK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,the United States,22-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely hate mopping the floor and it takes a long time, many times residue stays on the floor, I tried all kinds of brands and products for mopping, this vacuum is the best so far.It’s comfortable and light. It’s a bit noisy but I can take it. It dries fast on the floor and it picks up small pieces and hair very well.What I didn’t like was cleaning it afterwards....the dirty water and hair get sucked in the same container. I don’t want to dump hair into the toilet because it will get clogged eventually. So I threw the wet hair ball in the trash and dumped the dirty water in the toilet. Then had to flush the rest of the  dirty sediment in the laundry sink.Another thing, I have a few rugs but one has very long 1.5 inch fibers and this vacuum can’t clean it. I will have to keep my regular vacuum for that.",
McMoe,4.0 out of 5 stars,Gunks up,the United States,2-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Bought to use in 10 by 20ft mud room with tile floor that my dog comes in after being out side.  Now I wipe his feet on porch and I broom sweep the mud room before using Bissel cross wave.  And it still gunks up bad.  There is a rubber  squeegee on the bottom that just gets covered /clogged with mud.  so after twenty or so passes with the cross wave that squeegee is overwhelmed and now you are just smearing mud water so when it drys the floor has a coating of dried mud.  Inside there is a tube that dirty water goes through to get to dirty water tank and that gunks with mud bad.  Since there is mud clogging up the tube’s walls then the hair starts sticking to the mud and blah. Also the roller area walls get covered in mud .  All this even after using self cleaning feature.  I have to take it all apart and rinse rinse rinse to clean.  I have used the cross wave on my marble kitchen floor and hardwood floors in other parts of house and it works good.  But if you have a coonhound and you have mud and that’s the only reason you are buying this then maybe not. But for general “ oh there is a drip of ice tea on floor” kind of mess this works good. And it sucks the water off great the floor drys  in a couple minutes. And the separate tanks for clean and dirty wonderful!,
AKan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans well but you must clean it well,the United States,26-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This really works well. I was very happy with the good job that it does suctioning and wet-mopping at the same time. My only complaint is that the machine takes a fair amount of clean up. Essentially, with every use, you have to dump the dirty water, run the machine through a cleaning cycle with new water, dis-assemble three parts, handwash each part and let them air dry. So the cleaning required for the machine kind of negates the ease it provides in cleaning floors. It's still a worthwhile investment, but be aware.",One
Yova Garces,3.0 out of 5 stars,Get what you pay for,the United States,3-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Super easy to install and super easy to maneuver. Like that it works great in hardword/laminate floors.Does not do a great job on actual tile. The tank fills fairly quickly so you will constantly have to change the water.The vacuume part also is just ok, it does pick up small dust particles and light stuff like dirt or feathers. Does not pick up large items like in the video where it supposedly picks up cheerios.I have no carpets beside throw rugs, do not recommend using it on those. It will get it wet because the roll the machine use to mop is wet when used. Although it has a vacuume option, I don't recommend it. All in all for the price it does the job. It takes longer to really clean because I go over the same spots at least 3 times.",
jose,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,20-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Crosswave has a good concept however, I think they missed their mark in order to charge over $200 for this product. I got this in order to make things easier for me as a stay at home mom of 4. First use wasn't impressed at all and I had SUPER HIGH HOPES. I had some sticky spots on my floor that the machine wouldnt remove which makes sense when you look at the ""brissels"". They look just like a paint brush roller. To soft to agitate something stuck. Another issue I had was that as soon as I went to clean my area rug (white and grey) the roller transfered all the dirt and grime from my floors onto my rug. It was a mess and I had to go over it with an actual steam cleaner. (The book does say to wash prior to washing area rugs) and it makes sense that it would  transfer to my WHITE rug however it just makes extra steps when I have to completely clean the machine before proceeding on the rug. Then when you are done you have about 3/4 parts to clean and put back before you put it away.  I'm gona give it another try. However ,im super disappointed that this didn't make things easier like I thought it would of for spending $200+.",One
Cindy Brock,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes, and it didn't work as well as I expected",the United States,2-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have used a Hoover Floormate for years.  I opted to try this because of the vacuum/wet cleaning option.Both my housekeeper and I tried it.  Here's what we found:* The vacuum is fine, but nothing like a regular vacuum.  It wouldn't pickup the small amount of dirt on my low-pile rug as they show in the TV commercial. So, don't use it for just that purpose.* It does clean (you can see the dirt in the water), and the solution is excellent.  It doesn't foam up, and doesn't leave a residue.* It DOES NOT suck up the water very well.  The whole point of buying something like this is so you don't leave dirty water on the floor.  This left a ton of water on the floor, and we had to use a Swifter to get it all cleaned up.I had to wait a while to try this as our housekeeper could not come for a few months because of COVID.  Had that not been the case, and we had tried it sooner, I would have returned it.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product.",
 Bell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum and mop combo,the United States,12-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,October 2021 I read the reviews and followed the manufacturer’s instructions and advice in the reviews. Today was my first use and I cleaned 1000 square feet.  To ensure a great cleaning experience stop a couple of times and completely rinse out the dirty water tank and lower housing where the brush head sits. I did swap out brush head when I got to physical dirt areas because it will make dirty streaks. The dirty streaks are from having dirty floors. If you have dirt on the floor do a separate vacuum first then a crosswave cleaning and swap brush heads. I would rather go over the floors a couple of times versus dragging around a broom then a dirty mop. My high traffic areas came out clean using this method. I disassembled the vacuum/mop head to rinse and dry out like the directions recommend. I will update my review after the holidays around January. I would not recommend vacuuming up spaghetti like in one of the crosswave pictures it would be a gummy mess. Use a paper towel and pick up chunky messes and then use the crosswave just like you would with a normal mop. Use common cleaning sense.,

Magnum Apex,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bissel Crosswave ADDS TIME AND FRUSTRATION to your cleaning. Stick to a sweeper, hand vacuum & mop.",the United States,29-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF: - You want to save time cleaning. - You want to clean better and easily. - You like having a clean environment. - You don't want to get messy.I was looking to save time from sweeping, vacuuming and mopping. I also wanted something that would deeply clean my floors, so once I searched online it seemed a vacuum/mopping combo machine would do the trick. I bought the BISSEL Crosswave due to reading several sites rating it at or near the top, and the price range being reasonable. I figure spending a few hundred dollars for something that would save me time cleaning AND improve the cleaning results would pay off in the long-term. Sadly, it did the complete opposite and I now question all these consumer review sites.THE GOOD:The vacuum works fine. It does its job. It sometimes pushes small debris in front of it instead of sucking it in, but eventually it sucks the dirt. It feels nice to use compared to cheaper vacuums. I wish it could suck debris on the floor that's close to the wall or in corners, or provide an attachment to do so, but this isn't an unexpected problem from other vacuums I've used. Still, for a few hundred dollars I expected more. Has a Hard Floor and Rug options. Rug seems to be more powerful.THE GOSH DARN UGLY:Oh boy. Where to begin.Once you hold the button to allow solution to dispense on the brush, you can begin using the vacuum and mopping functionality simultaneously, and this is where all the problems begin:1. MEDIOCRE MOPPING: Any slightly sticky thing on the floor is not going to get cleaned by the brush, even if you follow the booklet instructions to do several swipes. A cheap mop, or your own hand swiping with a paper towel and cleaner will do a better job of removing grime from the floor than your hundreds-dollar machine.2. IT LEAVES DIRTY WATER STREAKS: If you're in the middle of your vacuum/mopping combo adventure and let the vacuum stand for a second while you move furniture around or what have you, a POOL OF DIRTY WATER will form under the vacuum. This will dirty the floor and the bottom of the vacuum, so you have to swipe the bottom of the vacuum clean before moving it elsewhere lest you risk leaking more dirty water around.3. YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT AFTER EACH USE, AND IT'S A MESS TO CLEAN: This is by far the worst aspect of Bissel Crosswave and the reason I wonder if reviewers tested it or are just saying whatever gets them clicks on their review sites. This alone completely wipes out any time-saving advantage you thought you had buying this, and then ADDS time and annoyance galore for hundreds of dollars from your wallet! After each use, especially when using the solution to mop, you have to remove 5 different parts and clean EACH of them and LET THEM DRY FOR 24 HOURS.Cleaning the parts is a pain. The dirty water container has dirty water, sticky hair and fibers that you have to dig through with your hands to clean out. Merely running water through it isn't enough as a lot of the disgusting black sticky parts get stuck in the container, and running water on it means you are dumping all that gunk on a sink that will at best require you to also clean your sink of the nasty black hairs or at worst block your plumbing over time. So best option is to dig the gunk with your hands and dump it in a water-resistant trash bag. Again, amazed anyone who gets cash from writing product reviews recommends this with a straight face. Shame on you.The filter, container and brush lids also need to be cleaned. The container lid in particular has moving parts and crevices everywhere, so you'll be spending a bit of time cleaning that.And lastly, cleaning the brush. Thinking about this brush turns me into The Hulk (green monster man who is fueled by immense rage, grandma). The booklet tells you to dump warm water on a stand the vacuum can be placed on, and then turn on the vacuum and clean the brush that way. This, this just spills water everywhere, even when filling it under the indicated amount in the stand.The brush is the source of all the nasty streaks left on the floor, as it retains a lot of water. This means the stand-cleaning method won't do any good in cleaning it, so you have to manually clean it in the sink with warm water. As it retains water, it takes a long time to dry, longer than the 24hrs the booklet recommends to let all parts sit drying before reuse. Reuse the vacuum too early, and the wet brush gets your floor and carpet wet again.Don't want to clean the vacuum/mop after each mop use? Then get ready for your floors and rugs to be cleaned with a beautiful solution of black and brown dirty water on subsequent uses.This is at best an average, if hugely overpriced, vacuum, and a hilariously terrible floor cleaner that should be recalled. It does not save you time, but adds time and work after each use.Baffled anyone recommended Bissel Crosswave.",
Crystal Burns,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissel Crosswave All in one Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner shortens cleaning time.,the United States,29-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have health conditions that leave me weak and fatigued so was interested in the Crosswave Wet Dry Vac since it does both sweeping and mopping at the same time. It does a great job on my laminate floors! It pulled up the coffee and food stains in the kitchen, dust and pet hair from the rest of the house and left behind beautifully clean floors! It took less time to clean the floors with the Crosswave than if I’d swept then mopped which is really important to me. It was simple to take apart and clean afterward. I love that you can buy replacement roller brushes! Only downside is that it leaves about a 1” gap along all edges where the machine can’t reach. The suction is great. There were no heavy wet spots (important for laminate) and the solution that came with it dried quickly.",
Fred Kilby,3.0 out of 5 stars,Finally got it,the United States,14-Jun-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Okay, we finally got the unit. The first one was late by a week (seems to be the current running theme with Amazon) and when it arrived, the box was damaged and over half of it was missing. I think the driver had just pulled away when I was on Amazon asking for replacement. The first one took a week and a half to get here, the replacement was in 3 days. It arrived in an undamaged box and all the parts were in it.We took it for a spin and frankly impressed with the performance. It does a really good job on hardwood floors, cleans and doesn't leave any extra liquid on the floor. It easily transitioned to area rugs and again they felt dry immediately. Easy to clean too, just take few parts off and wipe the unit with a damp microfiber cloth.",One
L B,5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite toy!,the United States,17-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE the multi function of this machine! It will not replace my carpet cleaner but it is an outstanding option for day to day cleaning between deep cleaning. It could use a little more suction on carpets and to my disappointment it leaves a gap of nearly an inch to  the baseboards. Not even a rubber tool to try to capture hair and debris.Easy to empty the tank; I am not one of those people grossed out by the findings in the tank. I prefer that it is clean for each use. I just use water as I do not want the cleaning fluid build up on my carpets. A ""funky"" smell develops between use when I have used the wet floor option. I have mitigated it (for the most part) by adding a little essential oil drops to the water tank.",One
Connie,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had high Hopes for an easier way to keep our floors clean,the United States,17-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've been using an electric steam cleaner on our hardwood floors for years but I'm getting older and wanted something that would clean the floors with less effort so I bought the Bissell Crosswave.  I used it for the first time yesterday and it was incredibly loud, like a jet plane taking off.  None of the presentations I saw had noise issues -- so I continued cleaning only to have the motor surge even louder and puddles were forming on the floor.  I turned the machine on/off many times and had the same issues.  it's possible we were unlucky and got a defective machine.  In the meantime I had to use our steam cleaner to remove the residue the Crosswave left.",
Seattle Guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Medium-Duty Cleaner EVER!,the United States,18-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The Crosswave is so easy to use for small and medium-level jobs on tile, carpet and even on hardwood floors.  We bought this mainly to clean our kitchen and bathroom tile floors, but it has exceeded our expectations.  We've used it to clean up after pet disasters on carpet and also used it on engineered floor surfaces and new vinyl plank flooring, with a few excursions onto our living room oak plank flooring with great results.  The other thing is that it is easy to load with cleaning fluids and emptying the dirty water tank is super-simple.  Also, popping the scrubber brush is another simple process.  This product is carefully thought-out and designed with the end-user in mind.  A tremendous value for us!",
Consumer from OH,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded expectations,the United States,18-Oct-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a white linoleum kitchen floor and 2 cats. Moping the regular way never worked well since pushing a mop just made hair and dirt collect along the perimeter. So I had to pick the mop up, lay it down on edge of floor and pull the mop towards me. It killed my lower back. I also tried every kind of mop, settling on one that holds a terrycloth shell that you launder. I hated cleaning my floors, so I never did them as often as I should. Well that is over! I just used the Crosswave and it’s a breeze. Easy and light and cleaned the floor great! The only time you need a bit of muscle is for rugs. My floors are cleaner than with my old mop since clean solution is constantly being used. Also, the vacuum function saves me from having to vacuum first.  Only drawback is cleaning the unit when done. But, you’ll have that with any wet floor machine. Still way easier than mopping! Definitely a great item. Hope it lasts!",One
LarryB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great unit.,the United States,7-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This Bissell cleaner is more than I expected. We have both ceramic tile and laminate flooring in almost the entire house and I hate mops. They are always dirty and hard to clean. This unit was a breeze. The only complaint I could have is that it is very noisy. That is overridden by the suction. I did our kitchen ceramic floor the first time and the suction is so good that I was able to do the entire floor in my socks. Did not even get damp! If you are careful and follow the instructions on how to handle the unit, it picks up all the water and dirt and leaves the floor almost completely dry! Its brush even gets into the grout and cleans that as well. Does a beautiful job.I was a little concerned about using it on the laminate flooring because it is older and not completely waterproof. After doing the kitchen and seeing how it leaves the floor dry, I moved to the living room and was pleasantly surprised to get a really clean, no streak floor with no leftover water to worry about. It was a little shameful how much dirt I got in the reservoir when I was done! Now it only remains to see how long this unit will last. It seems to be pretty sturdy, so I anticipate a long time.",
Mystie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it when it works, but it never works for long",the United States,23-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Purchased first one, worked for 6 weeks, then I only received partial credit for the return. Re-ordered because figured it was a flawed machine, lasted one week then same issue with water not coming out.  Yes, did all the trouble shooting. AND screen fell off the tank lid of the 2nd one within days of receiving it.  Ordered TWO more tanks to see if that was the issue and still NO water.  Great machine when it works but it doesn’t work for long.  Very frustrating!",One
A. Sparks,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good...,the United States,20-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I chose the Bissell Crosswave for my kitchen floor because I already own a Bissell vacuum cleaner for my carpets and I love it. The Crosswave is pretty good. It got a lot of hair and the water was dirty when I emptied the reservoir. The only thing I didn't like was it didn't clean up tougher stains. There was a bit of red icing on my linoleum from a birthday party and it didn't clean it all up.I had to scrub it a bit with a wet wipe. That being said,  I think it's definitely better than one of those flat ""mops"" with the wet or dry pads that you attach to it (I don't want to mention the name but I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about).I do like that it's light-weight. I had trouble getting the main component out of the box but after that it was easy to put together.Bottom line - better than the flat ""mops"" but not for heavy duty cleaning. I'm keeping it.",
Wallygirl47,3.0 out of 5 stars,Limited use,the United States,8-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Okay so it does what they said will do. It mops and Vacuums at the same time, which is great. So I can mop and vacuum my hard floors at the same time. my life However the three things that I don't like is that everything has to be disassembled after each use, when you clean urine up the machine blows the urine smell all over and it doesn't clean area rugs with pet stains well. I would like the assembly to be easier to take apart rinse and put back together. Other than that I really like the product. I do not think it's great for cleaning pet stains out of area rugs.,I have an indoor outdoor area rug with a new urine stain that this machine cant seem to clean.  Although it will clean urine and other random stains on hard floors.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love/Hate the CrossWave,the United States,25-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a love/hate relationship with the CrossWave.  I have dark, smooth, laminate flooring throughout my house.  I also have three dogs.  Between my floors showing Every.Single.Thing and the dog hair, my floors always look dirty.I had been using Bona and microfiber but my floors were always streaky.  I saw an infomercial for the CrossWave, read the reviews, and decided to try it.Here is what I love: Yes, my floors are cleaner and less streaky.  I ordered the hardwood brush which works MUCH better than the multisurface brush that came standard.What I don't love: The CrossWave does best when going with the grain.  When I have to go against the grain, it doesn't seem to suction up the solution as well.  This isn't going to make the job any shorter.  I find that the slower I go,  the better it works.  This also helps pick up more solution.  It seems like I have to use a lot of solution to wet the center of the brush.  This means I have more solution sitting in the crevices (tongue and groove flooring).  To limit potential damage, I plan to use the CrossWave for deeper cleaning and continue traditional mopping most of the time.",3
John Curry,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good deep clean.,the United States,22-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’ve used this several times in my home.  Each time picking up more dirt than I ever thought I had. I have used it on hardwood, tile and a floor rug.  It works well on all 3.  We remodeled over the summer and laid new hardwood and tile. I had been using everything to clean the floors. From damp swifter type mops to bringing out the mop bucket and wringing our the mop. I have finally found something that works on all my floors.  It works great on puppy pee and picking up dog hair. See the pics for the amount of hair And other debris it picked up.  It did a really good deep clean.  It did leave streaks when I allowed too much water on the floor. I polished it up with a swifter type mop and polish afterwards.  Clean up was easy. Just rinsed it under the faucet. There were no hard to reach places.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s alright,the United States,8-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I thought it did the job, I did notice the streaks that everyone mentions, I don’t think it was a big deal.I ended up returning it because I personally can’t deal with cleaning out all the parts after each use. It takes me longer to do that then to just mop the house. I might have not given it a fair trial but it was over for me the minute I had to take out all the parts and clean them . I am pregnant and have a toddler so I definitely don’t have the time.",4
C. Charles,5.0 out of 5 stars,I waited a month to see and I'm very pleased with this bissel,the United States,14-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I waited a month to see and I'm very pleased with this bissel. I have a cake business and my floor gets trashed and this does a good job on it. Much better than the Shark mop thing. This actually cleans the floor. BUT everytime you use it, you must clean where the brush roller sits and up in the little crevices. Take the time to clean out the filter too. Will make a big difference.Update December 7, 2017. Still am very pleased with this machine. Does a great job with mopping. Sometimes if I'm busy with my cakes I'm using it 3 times a week. I cant stress enough that when you are done mopping, put the machine right up on you sink and take the roller out and run water through the hole to rinse everything out. Rinse the brush thoroughly and rinse the cup and filter. Replace the filter and roller if you notice the suction is slowing down. I had to go to the Bissel site to order another filter; Amazon didn't have them...same price. I still have to use my scrubbie on dried on crud...big deal. This is a mop not a cleaning floor machine like you use in a business. I use distilled water because our water is so hard and add a little white vinegar. When I ran out of the Bissel cleaner, I bought a neutral floor cleaner from Menards's. Work fine and will not wreck the machine. Take a gallon of water and add 1 ounce of cleaner and keep it for your use...",5
Patricia Pearl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have children? Read this!,the United States,3-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Ok, so I splurged for Mother's Day (Happy Mother's Day to me 😬) and I have a 1 and 3 year old and let me just say that sometimes things get.... Messy. I got this because my children can be... Unhelpful when it comes to keeping the tile floors clean after meal time. I have a dog, but she is hypoallergenic so doesn't really shed, so I can't really speak on the hair portion of the review (although I have pulled my own hair out of the dirty water reservoir a couple of times).I LOVE this product. Ramen noodles on the floor? Try sweeping that up! Just clumps and sticks to the broom. Mop it up? Ok, squish it and it just spreads it's disgusting wet noodle self all over the floor. But with this thing? No worries! Turn that sucker on and it comes right up, no sticking, no nothing. Not just for ramen noodles though, apparently my entryway is absolutely disgusting every single time I use this thing. Super impressed and happy that I have an easier way to pick up after my monsters. I even wish there was a handheld version--- I'd use it on the table!Bottom line? Is it expensive? Yes, I wouldn't normally justify spending that much money. Is it worth it? Absolutely, 300%, yes, do it, you won't regret it. It even comes with an extra filter and brush. Guess I'm a Bissell mom now.",One
Phoenix,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Put My Floormate to Shame - Update, Still a Huge Fan After All This Time",the United States,25-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"I have a 2,600 sq ft house. Almost every single room is ceramic tile. The only room that doesn't have tile is the master bedroom and one of the master bedroom closets. Needless to say, cleaning the floors is one heck of a chore. I've used a Hoover Floormate since moving here and I thought that had been a lifesaver. Until this came.The foyer area has very high traffic. Six kids and pets and visitors... Needless to say that part of the house gets a LOT of traffic. My husband had just washed the floor of the foyer yesterday with the Floormate. Then today he used this to see what the difference would be. He stopped partway in to cleaning it to show me what was happening. I was horrified. That's great news for this miracle of a floor cleaner but BAD news for what I thought had been clean floors. You can see what he showed me in the attached picture.As you can see from the picture, the Floormate left behind a LOT of dirt and debris. And my kids walk on these floors barefoot! I was so upset that what we had thought were clean floors were actually filthy. This machine literally blows the Floormate out of the water.Not only does it do the job and do it well, but it's very easy to use. It's a lot lighter than the Floormate and does a much better job and is easier to maneuver. It's a definite must for anyone who has a lot of square footage with solid surface floors.We haven't had it long so I can't comment on its durability but if issues do arise I'll update my review at that time.Update: We recently moved to a larger house (we actually outgrew the other one after I took in two of a family member’s twin babies to foster and took guardianship of one of my teenage daughter’s friends and had another full-time household help member move in). So after more than a year of cleaning a 2,600 sq ft home every single day and a few months of cleaning a much larger house every single day (sometimes areas of both homes were done once a day) our beloved crosswave developed a short somewhere. We immediately knew there was no other machine for us and did a one click order to buy another one. Those two days of not having one were torture. Who’d have thought? It made me appreciate this appliance even more. While it costs more than the Floormate it still does a much better job (our floors are now white marble throughout the entire home so we need a good machine that will keep them spotless and the Crosswave is working wonders. Our first model lasted over a year. I want to say a year and a half? To me, even if I have to replace this every year, it’s well worth the price. Especially now that we have a number of very expensive area rugs that I need to clean regularly and the crosswave can tackle that task too. So all this time later and even though our first model broke we are still huge fans and we replaced our broken model with the same exact model. That is how much we love it. Plus I have to think if it didn’t have to handle SO much square feet and high traffic it’d have lasted at least twice as long as it did. For now I am falling in love with our replacement purchase all over again.","1,388"

Wash AND vacuum at same time.  Easy to set up and to use! Easy to clean.  Also works on small rugs snd mats with ‘tight’ knap. Is also very light.  You can use their cleaner chemicals or mix your own OR even a combination- for example, add a little vinegar, etc.  The ONLY improvement would be the cordless option.",One
TBowser,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,23-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Highly satisfied with my purchase! Prior to buying this we were using a basic broom and swiffer dry/wet. Cleaning floors was a 3 or 4 step process and we went through so many swiffer pads and still my floors never felt ""clean"" This has made cleaning my ceramic tile floors a breeze! It assembled within a few seconds... just pop on the handle until it clicks.  The water tank is nicely labeled for small and large areas which is nice. It's labeled to tell you both water and solution fill lines... So simple even a kid or husband could figure it out 😂 There's a button for hard floors and area rugs, those buttons initiate the roller and vacuum suction. There's a trigger on the handle to initiate spraying the solution to mop. So vacuum first, then go back over to mop. My entire kitchen was done in 5 min. It dries quickly. I went into our bathroom to dump and rinse the dirty water collection chamber after and the floor was totally dry by the time I finished. The only downfall i see is that like a vacuum this cannot get right next to the baseboards and has no attachments that could even do the job. So you'll be forced to still do the edges manually, I just took a swiffer wet pad and ran it along my baseboards. (I have included a picture of this area prior to cleaning with my swiffer so you can see the difference of before and after) For basic day to day cleaning and up keep this is def going to make my life so much easier!",2

I took it to my local vacuum shop to see if he could fix it, and the only advice he said was to throw away and get another one.He also mentioned that machines that have a vacuum and wet jet combined aren’t meant to last. It’s better to get a vacuum and a mop separate.When I did have it, I absolutely loved it!! It picked up a lot of dirt and gunk off my hardwood floor and carpet.

Whitney Clegg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for son with sensory problems.,the United States,21-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My son has feet sensory problems. I searched for months for the perfect vacuum for our home. One that I could use multiple times a day on my living room and dining room floors. I have both hard wood and a large area rug. My son's days are horrible if the floors aren't clean. I needed something better than the 3 mop/vacuum/Swiffer system I had going. This vacuum has changed my son's life. His days are so much better. This not only picks up the crumbs his brother leaves behind but cleans up the film of mud my mop left behind. Our feet are no longer dirty and our rug is no longer messy.With that being said, this is NOT a quick cleaning machine!!!  If you don't have the time to go over the wet floors with the vacuum to suck up the water then you're not going to be happy with this vacuum. When you receive the vacuum it comes with a pamplet full of tips and tricks. If you follow them and don't expect this vacuum to be Mary Poppins magical, then you will love it! It does take time to clean but it is well worth it. It saves me hours of cleaning, back ache, and my son has a better life because of it.I see a lot of reviews on here about how horrible this vacuum is because it leaves streaks. Use it correctly and it won't leave streaks. Replace the filter and brush regularly. Clean the hose that goes from the brush compartment to the dirty water tank. Use warm/hot water in the formula bottle. Treat it properly and it will be the best wet/dry vacuum you've ever used.",One
Patricia O'Neal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans so well it's worth the time to take it apart and put it together,the United States,25-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have five pets and three children ranging in ages from 8 months to 15 and this is the cleanest our floor has ever been.I will be honest and say my pugs are bad, they pee inside if the weather is inclement and both the dogs and the cats shed so of course it's hard to deodorize my house or have it feel really clean.This thing does the trick!! We have tile in the main areas and bathrooms and carpet in the bedrooms. The crosswave says to it does area rugs not carpet but truthfully I have used it on the bedroom carpets with no issues and the carpets look FAB! I do a wet pass and a dry pass and they are pretty much dry afterwards (this works on the tile as well).There are only two downsides to this product and they really aren't downsides.One is that you must make sure all extraneous bits like Legos etc are picked up which can be tricky with kids but this is my rule with all vacuums.Two is that you have to take this thing all apart and clean it and let the bits dry EVERY time you use it (which also means putting it back together next time), which can be time consuming.",2
Diane Laliberte,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you think your floors are clean, think again!",the United States,14-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Let me just start out by saying that within 2 hours of delivery, I was back on Amazon looking to order a second one for my boyfriend's house - I liked it that much.  No buckets, no dirty, heavy mops, no dreading washing your floors.  Just fill the clean water bottle and hit the button - it's  that easy.  I had just mopped my floors with a wring mop and bucket.  I then went over it with the CrossWave using a water and vinegar solution and the dirty water container was unbelievably dirty - and I had just finished mopping!  Apparently all I had done was slosh dirty water around with the mop.  With the CrossWave, the water used is always clean water.  I was concerned with over-wetting my hardwoods, but that doesn't happen.  The water/cleaning solution is sprayed on top of the rolling brush, not onto the floor then sucked up, so over-wetting does not happen.

But it worked great.The tank will give you an option of small or large area. I naturally went with the large and ended up filling it three times to clean the floors in my house.The cleaning solution that is provided with the Crosswave is good for (2) large fills. So I would recommend you purchase an additional cleaning solution bottle.I followed the directions and cleaned the Bissel as directed and it worked out great.I have (2) nit-picks.. - First, it is made in China - Second the handle could use some cushion in the grip. The hard plastic is not the most comfortable.If I could give it 4.5 stars I would..Will update down the road on long term performance.",
alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to maneuver, decent vacuum power and mopping, excellent in being quick and easy",the United States,1-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"it’s not the strongest vacuum, or the strongest mop, but i think if you sweep before you use it and you use it every couple weeks, then it is perfect to maintain the cleanliness of your house in a much easier process. i have 2 cats whom i never groom, and this vacuum handled the post-sweep residual cat hair perfectly. honestly, when i used it, my floors had been shamefully filthy (it had been a very very long time since i had mopped) and they ended up looking clean. maybe not ""lick-the-floor"" clean, but i think acceptable ""i'll-still-eat-this-cheetoh-i-dropped"" clean, and i definitely think if i cleaned more regularly then it would obviously be... cleaner.i found the vacuum very easy to maneuver - it’s light weight and has good a good swivel action. the handle has one button for vacuum and one button for vacuum+mopping.i've seen some reviewers mention that it left grimy streaks, and i have to say that i am surprised because my floors were honestly super gross and it didnt leave any obvious streaks. my floor looked cleaner than it had in a tragically long time. my previous cleaning process had been quite involved (possibly part of why i avoided it), which was: sweep, vacuum, (optionally scrub with a scrub brush), sponge-mop, followed by wet swiffer (not swiffer wet jet, just the wet swiffer wipes as opposed to the dry ones). maybe its just because sponge mops suck, but i found that this process left a surprising amount of streaks on the floor (how could so many steps leave streaks?) . this vacuum has really reduced my cleaning routine and made cleaning more accessible and less unappealing to me.i got it because it was an amazon flash sale and it came with one bottle of cleaning solution. you can use any solution with it, you don't need to use their branded solution. i already had a dyson vacuum which i found cumbersome and have since given away.oh, the only drawback (and this might be super obvious) is that you do have to empty the used solution when you finish using it. since it mops and vacuums, obviously it sucks up the dirty mop water as you go, and that goes into a chamber in the machine. if you dont empty it right away it obviously gets like super moldy and gross, so you should empty it as soon as youre done and not forget about it like i did.",
Timothy L Kelley,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,the United States,12-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If you have hardwoods or laminate, don’t buy this- get a steam mop instead. My new house has “luxury” vinyl planks and unfortunately you can’t use a steam mop on them so I bought this instead. It takes 10 times as long to clean a floor with this, going slowly over areas, trying to not use too much water or you get dirty tire marks or streaks or blobs of dirty water. If you get too close to white quarter round, have a paper towel ready to wipe up dirty streaks. After mopping my 600 sqft downstairs my floors still seem dirty. Only positive I have for it is it did a nice job on area rugs but you have to make sure the brush is ultra clean and dry before you tackle them. It’s easier and quicker and your floors come out cleaner to wet jet, save your money.",
Amanda G,2.0 out of 5 stars,Streaks!,the United States,21-Nov-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I got this product in yesterday. Woke up SUPER early today to clean the floors because I was so excited. It was doing great. Scooping up the dog hair and washing the floors right after... Well... Once the floors started to dry, I saw nothing but white streaks and it made the floors look dirtier... So i cleaned the tank and the brush and compartment and went over floors again and even went slower to hopefully suck up more of the water... Once again, the floors were streaky after drying... I was so disappointed. So I boxed it back up and its waiting for UPS. I don't want to spend $250 to have to clean the floors twice with still bad results. Not worth the money. :/ And I'm a religious Bissell customer.",3
Guinevere,5.0 out of 5 stars,This Bissell CrossWave machine has changed my life!!,the United States,13-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I can’t find ONE thing I don’t like about this handy well built floor and carpet cleaner.  It’s sturdy, easy to assemble and handle, and strong enough to pick up all dirt and hair on both floors and low pile carpets. (It also vacuums without using the spray feature.) When using the spray solution feature it works like a mini steam cleaner, dispensing a water solution, vacuuming up the dirty water and storing it in the bottom tank. Emptying the tank and cleaning the machine is quick and easy. It does a FANTASTIC job on cleaning tile and grout, hardwood and all hard floors.  No more mopping or getting down on your hands and knees  to clean tile grout!  Best household cleaning machine!!",One
A. M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves the floors clean to the touch,the United States,25-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Since you can't buy any more Scooba floor mopping robots anymore (at least not new), and ours is on its last legs (erm, wheels?) I wanted a floor washer that uses the same principle of cleaning: Spray with cleaning solution, agitate, then squeegee up into a separate tank. I'm kind of amazed how few devices of this type are on the market.Dragging a mop across the floor seems to me like it's mostly going to spread the dirt evenly, and maybe pick up half of it. This thing leaves the floors clean to the touch. You can also see how much dirt it lifts from the floor because the water in the waste water tank is gray.It's a bit loud, but not unbearably so. Easy to clean, empty and fill the tanks, and do all other maintenance. The little tray stand is a nice touch for when I'm parking the still-damp machine in the corner. It also has neat little pegs to hold the brush up to dry when you take it out.My fave part: I don't have to vacuum before mopping, it does both in one go. Def. a plus for when you don't count floor washing as one of your hobbies.",2
Wendy De Rycke,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best money I ever spent.,the United States,26-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,What a helper!  Mastiff dog hair everywhere which I have been battling since I in with my son and grandkids.  The rugs returned to their natural colors not muted from hair the vac did not pick up.  The tile floors no longer leave your feet dirty replacing my old method of a Mr. clean sponge and my foot.  I use to hate the tiles until I got all the dirt off of them and discovered the accents were not black but a medium shade of brown against the cream.,One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans Great But Hard to Clean Out,the United States,5-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have an in-home preschool with 10 children, plus I also have a dog and a cat.  Let me tell you, this thing is a LIFE SAVER!THE PROS:  It's very easy to use and it really does vacuum and mop at the same time!  I love running it after lunch in the preschool as it picks up chunky things such as food that has fallen on the floor and little scraps of paper from our art projects.  It's also great at picking up pet hair.THE CONS:  The only real ""con"" to me is that it is pretty gross to clean.  This would probably be an easier job, however, if I would follow the manufacturer's recommendation of cleaning it EVERY time I use it.  I use mine every day and clean it probably once a week.  The other con is that since it uses water (to mop), anything ""chunky"" gets mixed in with the water.  And where do you pour that nasty water?  I had been pouring mine down my garbage disposal until I found a nail that it had picked up.  So it's challenging to pour the liquid out but also find a place for the pet hair and chunky things.IMPROVEMENT IDEA:  If this thing could somehow have a strainer in it so that it could strain the chunks from the water, it might be perfect!",2
Ember,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware scam!,the United States,3-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Way too expensive to work like trash! I own the bissel green machine spot cleaner for years and it has held up and works amazing 10 plus years later. This mop/vacuum leaves streaks throughout my tile flooring and wood floors! It's horrible! Barely picks up anything! When I tried to return amazon wouldn't let, within the return window as well. The listing just magically dissapeared for a month! Even others who purchased had the same problem! and kept giving me this number to call for parts through the amazon website, not like a regular purchase where you just click and return the item, wouldn't allow me to. Then the return window closes and all of a sudden I get an email on how the vacuum is and the listing is back up magically! Do not get scammed like many others have!The filters are already growing mold, even being cleaned thoroughly and after every use and dried correctly. I feel like these are possibly old or returned machines as one of the filters came open and was dusty! Even the listing was taken down for a short period of time, and I couldn't find it on amazon, just came up as dogs, and here we are the product is back up out of no where! Buyer beware!",
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saves Time!,the United States,4-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just used the Crosswave for the first time the other day. I had read the reviews on it and was hoping it lived up to its reputation. I was pleasantly surprised at how it worked. I went from hard flooring (laminate and linoleum) to carpet (area) with no problems. You have to switch the settings, but that is just the flick of a button. It did a good job, dried quickly, and was easy to use. I filled the clean water tank up to the ""large area"" line and it cleaned our bathroom, living room, dining room and kitchen. (Our house is only 1144 sf). Cleanup of the machine was easy, as was some disassembly required to do so. Reassembly was easy too. What I really like: not having to go over the flooring twice, first to sweep, then to mop. The machine did a great job. Easy clean up, assembly and disassembly. No drawbacks that I have encountered so far. I did purchase the corded model because so many battery appliances lose their charge not long after purchase. And getting a new battery is nearly as costly as buying a new machine. I'll take the corded variety any time!",
amanda,1.0 out of 5 stars,Find something else unless you have the time for this,the United States,20-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I dislike this vacuum more than I have any others. You have to clean it out every day and then wait 24 hours for everything to dry. I decided to try not cleaning it out because I had a million things to do. Came back a couple of days later and it smelled awful it was disgusting and all I’d done is vacuum up some dirt and leaves there shouldn’t have been any liquid but there clearly was cause everything was muddy and awful. Also waiting 24 hours for everything to dry is ridiculous. I have three kids. They don’t take 24 hours off and make zero messes in that time.  I may be inclined to get over that part if it actually did it’s job rather than making a bigger job to do. It pushes things around and out of the way so you cleave your chase the debris you’re trying to vacuum up. I used the leaves in the video because they show up the best and show what it’s actually doing. Definitely going to find something else.,One
Savanna ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Is this witchcraft?!,the United States,24-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So...I am not one to usually rave about mainstream products, but....I just have to share.Those that know me know that I see myself as a clean person. I keep my house tidy, sweep and mop every other day, and make sure it smells good for unsuspecting visitors. That being said.......bruh!!!!!!I didn't realize that my family was secretly living in squalor! I am disgustingly amazed by how gross my floors truly were! I mean check out the pics!If you have been on the fence about getting one of the Bissell Crosswave Wet Vacs, please just do yourself a favor and splurge on this magical machine. I am truly in awe! Worth every last penny! I did my kitchen, dining room, and living room floors with one bottle of water and solution. I dumped after every room just to see how gross 🤢And just in case you're wondering, I did do an after test. I sprayed the same cleaning solution straight into the floor where I'd mopped, and using a fresh paper towel scrubbed. As you can see. Clean paper towel, not a spec of muck! Buy. This. Vacuum.

ShannonD,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans very well!,the United States,1-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Product as described and it arrived on time. I used this for the first time today. I was shocked at the amount of dirt I had been missing before. The dirty water tank was disgusting after cleaning my floors, but this was easily dumped and rinsed out. It took me 2 refills and 2 dirty tank dumps to clean my laundry room, dining room, kitchen, hallway, and living room. I have a cat and a dog, I was surprised that no pet hair was caught on the brush. The cleaning solution smells nice. I didn’t notice any streaks as mentioned in other reviews. I give this product 5 stars and recommend to others. I’ll update after a few months.",
K. Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Are my floors actually clean?,the United States,4-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Our cleaning routine is pretty thorough. We don’t wear shoes in the house. 1 dog, no kids. Overall our home is well maintained and surfaces are cleaned regularly.The unit “cleans” but don’t expect spotless results on the 1st pass, or 2nd, or 3rd, or 4th? I anticipated  water in the waste tank to be nearly clear after going over the floor 2 or 3 times. I plan to use it more often to see if clear waste water is achievable but as of now, in terms of cleanliness, it doesn’t seem much different than a wet mop.The system overall is very convenient. It saves on time and effort typically required to mop or scrub floors. No changing of buckets of water. Cleanup is simple. The components fit together well and assemble and disassemble easily.",
Kayla Powell ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great but not for glossy floor’s,the United States,5-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Ok so I’ve never been completely satisfied in any floor product! But this is amazing! Before I go gushing about it I’ll give you the con. The other reviews are right it does streak. So if you have glossy floors it’s not for you. However I have vinyl plank floors that are textured and this is perfect for that! It picked up anything and everything even stuff my shark vacuum wouldn’t pick up off carpet. If your wanting a very clean thorough mop job do it with a hand mop but besides that this thing was amazing! I’m super happy with it!Update: less then a month the piece that covers the brush broke. Then the container that holds dirty water started leaking all back in the floors!!! It was great for less then a month now worthless!,One
GGRussell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for vinyl or laminate flooring,the United States,2-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really like this floor cleaner, but it has a few flaws.  Doesn't seem to get even fluid on floor to get up tough stains.  The liquid actually squirts on the roller.  Seems like the liquid is just spun out and sucked up before hitting the floor.  More like a design flaw IMO.  Granted it still cleans the floor, but not as thoroughly as expected.  Still a keeper. Much easier than using mop and bucket!",One

Kris B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,A lot of cleanup of item after use,the United States,15-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Are use this item on my linoleum kitchen floor, and hardwood eating area. I liked this product because when I was finished the floors actually felt clean underneath my bare feet. I have been unable to clean the floors in my normal way, which is on my hands and knees, and therefore there was a lot of stuff on my floors when I used it the first time. It absolutely sucked everything up that was on the floor, and clean the area at the same time  The cleaning formula has a mild fragrance. But if you follow the instructions as for the cleaning of the product afterwords, it is a lot to do. It took about 15 minutes to clean everything that I had to detach, and the brush. I don’t imagine you would have to do this every time, which I probably won’t. But if you want to do it the way they suggest, be prepared to invest a lot of time in cleaning the machine afterwards.  I would’ve given this product a five star review, but the cleaning up afterwards makes it a four star.",One
Didi B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why didn't I buy this sooner!,the United States,5-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a huge tiled kitchen and always dreaded having to pull out the mops to clean it. It always streaked and it had to be cleaned in a particular direction. With 2 small dogs and lots of foot traffic my kitchen floor was always a mess. NOT ANYMORE! I look forward to pulling out the Bissell and having a sparkling floor every day. It's so easy, just like vacuuming and you see the results in the waste container, which motivates me clean even more.It's good for area rugs and small clean ups on rugs. Not a rug cleaner in my opinion, not even for dog accidents but it does a good enough job to draw up the surface dirt and on the carpets and give it a little extra tlc.Just as good on hardwood floors as it is on the tile.",

For those of you trying to decide between the corded and cordless model, this little guy has a super long cord. I'm sure that being cordless is super convenient but I like the fact that I can plug it in and go and don't have to worry about whether or not my vacuum is charged.I do wish it would work just a vacuum as well for when that is all that is needed.Emptying out the dirty water container is gross. The dirty water and vacuumed stuff are combined making it a soggy, gross mess to clean out.It would be 5 stars if there was a better way to handle that, I give it 4.25 🌟",

The suction was so strong and did a great job vacuming AND mopping the floors. However 3 months after owning it, the suction is no longer that strong. It feels like water is just leaking out. There is a puddle of water/dirt on the floor, at the exact spot where I turn it off. When I use it, it seems like the mop is just gliding over an excessive thick layer of water that it dispenses. Like it was no longer is rolling on the floor via the wheels, but seems like it just losing control and gliding all over the floor.

heather Lovell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice vacuum, not so good mop",the United States,27-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this. I researched all the vacuum/mop combos on the market and settled on this one.  Unfortunately it's only so so.  I vacuums easily and well.  But the mop portion is not good.  Doesn't do a good job, if there are any sticky spots or anything of the like it does not scrub it off. I have to go over it with my Bona mop to get a good clean floor which defeats the purpose.  Kind of regret buying this.  It is the pits to clean and its loud too. Save your money, buy a broom and a Bona mop system that will do a better job.",One

NOT ANYMORE! Believe me! It cleans messes sooo goood ! I always add hot water  and slowly vacuum the floor. You will not believe the gunk it pulls! My floor is ceramic textured tiles and i hate how the dirt sits in all the groves. Thats the only reason why i vacuum in two rounds. First round spray the soap solution and second to just clean and let the tiles shine bright. For the carpets its pretty hard to maneuver. You need to put in some elbow grease . But overall very helpful.",
RodneySB,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wife wasn't impressed and even wanted to return.,the United States,21-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Wife used it a few times, for the price paid she doesn't feel the value is there. Here is why.Its very slow going to use this.  She can vacuum and mop faster than doing the floor with this device alone.  It takes repeated passes to first vacuum and then mop so its very slow going. She has long hair and this doesn't do a great job with that either. She is still using it hoping it grows on her I guess but mostly disappointed. Likely will end up in our RV.  She did look into returning it but waited to long. It does a good job just doesn't make it any faster and she feels like she physically works hard using this device than stand alone vacuum and a swifter mop.",
Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,a great invention,the United States,1-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This will change the way you think about cleaning your floors.  So much better than a mop.  I used to like to mop, i have all the fancy mops.  But reusing dirty water was not smart.  This takes clean soapy water, delivers it to the brush to clean the floor then vacuums the dirty water up into a second tank.  Brilliant.  I love the fact that you can vacuum and mop at the same time.  My prior device, a Hoover, you had to vacuum the floor before using the machine.  This is a fantastic improvement in floor cleaning.  Negatives:--loud--you have to take it apart after every use to clean and dry it",

Anyways, I got it and loved it. It sucks up well. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because everytime i use it it smells horribly. I cant figure out why, its completely cleaned out, using the right cleaner and measurements. Only thing ive found to help is I have to use fresh water everytime, not a huge deal but wastes alot of product if i dont guess right",4

darren moreno,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does as advertised!,the United States,10-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have had this product for over a year now, and hear are my thoughts on anyone wanting to purchase one. This product does what it says and very well might I add. It is great for hardwood floors. It cleans thoroughly. Vacuums just as good as most vacuums and mops as well. It distributes clean water to the floor and sucks all the dirt and dirty water into a separate canister so the dirty water never touches your floor again. It actually saves you a lot of time doing floors. Though the time it saves you in cleaning floors. You spend a lot of time cleaning the actual unit after you are done cleaning the floors. First off you have to clean the canister where all the dirt and dirt water went into and sometimes if you have a lot of dirt and junk that won’t easily come out of the container that requires you to stick your hand in there and remove the gunk and junk by hand. The roller also needs a cleaning as well and most of the time if you have dirty floors it will require you to use more than water to clean the roller. I have always had to use soap to clean it. Also I noticed this unit isn’t great for hair. My wife literally sheds more hair than a Golden Retriever so I usually find myself untangling or cutting off hair off the roller more than I would like to. The filter works great, but definitely replace when its time to otherwise the smell from having it sit in there too long is terrible. All in all I do like this product and use it quite frequently. This product is quite great but know to keep it running great you will need to clean and service it often.",2

The rollers are 1.5 inches from the edge of the head and do not clean anywhere near the baseboards.  The power cord is attached to the bottom of the unit and is  ALWAYS in the way while you work.  You are constantly bending down to grab the darn cord to get it out of the way.  Cleaning the unit afterward is another chore that I don't need.

Hoosier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,1-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Have only used twice so far, but I'm very pleased and impressed! It really works well and delivers a very clean floor. (Ceramic tile in my house) Getting started and clean up afterward for me is still slow but will improve with further use...I still need to refer to the owners manual. Two very small negative comments. One, the swivel head isn't very flexible for getting into tight spaces and two, after use it takes a full 24 hours for the parts (tanks, brush head etc) to dry out. However, the ease of actual use and sparkling result far outweigh these small negative aspects.  I highly recommend this product!",
Bryan Gilman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t hesitate, just buy it!!",the United States,4-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am actually upset I didn’t discover this product sooner!!! I LOVE IT!! I used it for the first time today in one of my carpeted living rooms and this was the final results. We don’t even wear shoes in the house! This vacuum is so awesome. Plus it is quite lightweight which makes cleaning a lot more tempting and easier!! I have purchased a steam mop from Bissell 2 years ago and that mop is so heavy, I actually dread steaming my floors. So the fact that this vacuum is lightweight, that’s a huge plus in my book. Overall, it cleans really well. My carpets dried in no time, in less than 30 mins. I used 3/4 water, 1/4 vinegar & 20 drops of essential oils. I’m happy I got this, now I won’t dread cleaning the floors. All in one is brilliant. Makes cleaning that much easier.

Martin Kollman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite Christmas Present for My Wife,the United States,1-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My wife hates to admit this to her friends, but this was her favorite Christmas present.  While I used to do the floors, since she hated doing them, this has changed things in our house.  In one easy to use motion it sucks, dampens, cleans and dries the floor with a super clean and walk on a minute later surface.  Load up the tank with solution and water to make it ready is about all you have to do.  The big tank setting will do our kitchen, dinning room, hallway and entry with no problems.We do a light vacuum or sweep first to get rid of the big stuff, but if you floor isn't that bad, you wouldn't have too.  We have kids, dog, neighbor kids, and winter crud, so our floors are usually that bad.  It will handle anything, but just gets dirty faster and more hair is why we might get the big stuff.  We can do everything from pulling it out to sucking  to cleaned up in about 30 minutes, so it makes it quick and easy.  Biggest thing is the floors are pretty much dry after you move the vacuum over them.  No tracking, waiting, or foot prints everywhere.  Cleaning is easy with sink rinse and let it air out a bit to dry.  5 minutes to cleanup and set to dry.I give credit to my sister, as she is a professional clean freak and this is her baby with about 1,000 sft of floor that has to be cleaned.  She LOVES this and that is why we now have one.  Great buy!",
T. Carlson,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT RECOMMEND!!  Im going back to my 10 year old HOOVER again!!!,the United States,7-Aug-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I thought this was going to be great for cleaning my vinyl plank flooring. It seemed to work pretty well—for about a month. First the suction began to fail and it didn’t pick up as much water. I had to mop up the extra.  Then the cleaner bottle began leaking. I had to buy a replacement. Then the machine stopped squirting out the liquid.  You can’t clean a floor with a dry brush. Husband tried to fix it and could find no  problems. It just quit working. $240 bucks and only lasted 2 months!!!UPDATE:  Customer service was great. They replaced my machine with a brand new one. Guess what?  Used it about 6 times and the same thing happened. This time I can see the problem—the water/cleaner holes are so small they apparently get clogged. I can see the liquid to the point where it comes out, but it doesn’t come out. Tried to clean WITH A STRAIGHT PIN.  The holes are so small a pin point won’t even fit in them. Another POS for the landfill. Keep resorting to my 10 year old Hoover which has lost a little suction but still works better than the Bissell Crosswave!!",
LexisMommie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing the  symphony is so much better.,the United States,30-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I must say I had high hopes for the cross wave. I had a Bissell symphony pet edition for over a year and absolutely loved it! It broke because I tried a diy cleaner in it of Pinterest and the essential oils broke it. So I was going to buy another and people were telling me about the cross wave and how great it was and it looked it like was better cleaning power, but I was wrong. For being almost 50 dollars more then I paid for the  symphony it doesn’t live up. It leaves dirty streaks on the floor you have to go over and over and over to get rid of even if you do a very go sweeping first. It is hard to clean and if you don’t clean it every use (like take apart the whole thing and clean every piece.) it stinks horribly. It doesn’t really scrub stuff up even with letting the brush sit there and going over the spot over and over again.",3
HANNAH,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could use a few improvements,the United States,22-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"1.) It does not get close to the baseboards, which is a little disappointing since this is where a lot of debris accumulates. 2.) On tile floors, it doesn't really clean the grout very well. 3.) It doesn't hold much water, so it's a little annoying to have to keep constantly refilling the cleaning solution and dumping the dirty water if you're covering a lot of square footage. 4.) It can be tedious cleaning all of the little parts after each use before storing. Would not recommend pulling it out for quick messes you could clean up with a rag. 5.) Human hair does wrap around the brush roll like a traditional vacuum. Cut and remove to keep it performing optimally.Otherwise, it's a nice little machine to have on hand if you have a fairly large amount of hard surface flooring in your home. Definitely will save you time during routine cleaning.",
Nick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!!,the United States,9-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This Vacuum is amazing! Like a previous reviewer said “I don’t get all of these bad reviews”. If you don’t take care of the vacuum and or clean it the way it’s supposed to be cleaned, it’s not going to work the way you want. If you take care of it, this is an amazing time saver/tool. No issues with this vacuum. We have two dogs and it gets all of the hair while mopping the floors. Saves me a ton of time.

KAEAM,4.0 out of 5 stars,A great vacuum and alright mop,the United States,10-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I started off with the Hoover Spin Scrub and thought it did a great job at mopping but a terrible job as a vacuum so I returned it and bought this.  While it’s not the best of both words it sure is a lot better at being a vacuum than the spin scrub.  The mop isn’t bad honestly and really the only complaint I have is that it will smear dirt/mud around when the roller gets too dirty.  Clean it off and your back to normal but it takes a bit of time to do that.  The best bet so far is to dry vacuum the area with this thing before you mop vs both at once if it’s too dirty.  A bit speedy but does the trick for me and makes it a lot easier.,4
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,had high hopes,the United States,7-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to love this wet dry vac, and I can say that I was happy with it's performance on carpet. It had good suction and when you used the wet feature it really worked well. However, on hardwood floors if you tried to use the wet vac feature it left horrible streaks, leaving the floors dirtier than before. I read some reviews mentioning this but I didn't believe it. Well after using it 3 times it is pointless. My floors are a mess from it and I have to go over them with my real mop. Lastly, it was kind of annoying when using both the wet and dry features that there was about an inch on both sides that you couldn't get. So when you go against a wall you would have to use the front of the vac to get against the wall and not go in a long line like most vacuums.",
heather,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk,the United States,8-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I am so mad at how bad this works and how much it cost. I can’t use it without taking it apart every time.

Angie Rodgers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing!,the United States,17-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This saved my wood floor at my old house and is working amazing on the tiles in my new home.I was using a pad spray mop thingie with Bona solition on my wood floors and after a while I noticed that toe prints and paw prints were showing up! You could easily track the migration patterns,And it kept getting worse.There was a film buildup and it looked so bad, I stopped having company over.I tried different products and then saw the add for cross wave on tv.I used the bissell cleaner solution that came with it. It took the film off and it never came back!This machine has great suction power and does not leave streaks (if it does leave dirt streaks it means that you need to rinse of the roller brush)I love to walk on my floors after I use the Crosswave!It’s unbelievable how dirty floors get! After each use, make sure you dump the dirty water bin and rinse the filter under the sink, if you don’t, the next time you use it will be stinky.Suction works so well it makes the drying time very fast.My floors have never looked or felt cleaner!Totally recommend!",

The upkeep on it is horrible and it doesn’t work as well as it says it does. I’ve tried deep cleaning it, get new brush rolls and filters, but nothing works. The suction is awful, it just blows things around half the time, when using the wet feature on floors it leaves streaks and is uneven, it doesn’t get up hard spots on hard wood or carpet; all around I wasted the money on this when I could’ve just bought a good regular vacuum and a nice mop.

Not happy, very overpriced product, rude customer service, so so far I’m holding onto a machine with its cord cut, and that was the only thing to clean my floors, just get something else this company is awful and won’t be purchasing from them ever again.

Well Read Human,3.0 out of 5 stars,It works fine,the United States,6-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I liked the cleaner/vacuum but it was heavy for me and the water/cleaner mix ran out pretty quick.  It does clean the floors well but you do have to stop and clean the brush well and clean out the dirty water and put new cleaner/water back in. If you don't stop and clean it you will get streaks on the floor. I used it and cleaned with it and my floors looked great, it was just a lot of effort to take apart and clean the roller and get new water/cleaner in it after each room.  I would have kept it but too much to stop and clean when I can grab my swiffer with reusable pads.  If there was a way to hook to your sink so that the dirty water went down the sink drain and the clean water refilled into the machine with a long cord then it might be for me. I am sure a lot of people love this machine.  I am constantly busy don't have time to spend half a day pulling it apart just to mop floors. This would be good for parents with younger children that spill stuff.  I would recommend to others especially if detailing your home for guests etc.I sent mine back for a refund they were decent about it.",
M. Barbetta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get this item,the United States,2-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this because I HATE mopping my floors and Swiffer just seems to move the dirt around.I would use a new swiffer pad on an area I just cleaned and the new pad would get just as dirty, and it didn't matter how many times I changed the pad.Anyway, I was astonished at how dirty the dirty water tank got after cleaning [a newly swiffered floor] with this product.As an engineer, I am delighted at how well engineered and constructed this thing is.It is well made, but lightweight, and easy to push around for a while.It is ergonomic, and also easy to disassemble and put back together again.Also, there is an ""easy clean"" feature you can use that doesn't require taking the roller or filter out.All-in-all, it is a fine product, easy to use, and easy to clean, and does a fantastic job.",
Oldfarmer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tile and harwood floors are a snap,the United States,16-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Please do not think this product is a dry vacuum. It disperses cleaning solution and the vacuum sucks that back up. The brush does the work, getting up the dirt with the aid of the solution. If you keep a clean home, this machine will be a major aid in keeping it so. Some reviewers fault this product for symptoms that suggest an overly dirty home, such as streaky floor, a result of excessive dirt on the floor, which this machine can remove with successive uses. I am very pleased with this purchase and how it performs. My tile has never been so clean!",
Lauren,2.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe I expected too much?,the United States,16-Mar-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I assumed that this would be excellent for my tile floors. I have two types of tile- one is stone and is slightly textured, one is basic ceramic and is smooth. I thought this would make deep cleaning the tile and grout a breeze. While it did pick up a lot of dirt that I couldn’t see, and the water in the dirty water tank was visibly dirty after it was sucked back up, I was disappointed in the performance. I had to hold the button to make the “steam” come out for a long time to saturate the area and run the Bissell over it several ways several times to get it to clean a visible spot. I put “steam” in quotation marks because it really isn’t steam. It’s a mist and it is not warm unless you put hot water in the clean water tank. My house also didn’t smell like I had just deep cleaned the floors. I wish I had bought this at a local store so I could take it back. I won’t be returning it because I hate shipping things, but I definitely regret spending $300+ on this item.",5
R.L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would snuggle mine if nobody was watching,the United States,6-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a shoe free household and the water comes up opaque grey every time. I used to “mop” on my hands and knees and rinse the rag between sections, because traditional mopping smears the dirty water around the floor rather than removing the filth like elbow grease does. This machine sucks the dirty water off the floor and out of the cleaning brush as you go.While I don’t think this saves time, because I do several passes and let the brush really scrub the floor... it definitely saves you physical effort, it’s as easy as a thorough vacuuming. And it cleans WELL.  Dare I say better than hands and knees cleaning section by section.As for cleaning the appliance after use, it doesn’t bother me. I find the process pretty quick, it takes me about 6 minutes to clean and rinse and put away.",3

SarahP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,the United States,5-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Where has this been all my life?!  My house is 2300 sq feet and mostly all wood floors. I live in the country (lots of dirt and mud), I have three kids, two dogs and a husband who refuse to wipe their feet before they come in my house. I have really pretty dark hardwood floors...or they were really pretty when first installed. I really deep clean my floors only when company comes over because it’s a lot of work and takes forever!  I used to sweep twice and mop with two different mops to get my floors looking fresh and clean. Well let me tell you! I’ll never pick up a mop or sweep again!! This little miracle vacuum/mop is the greatest thing I’ve purchased in a really really long time. It did an amazing job of picking up the dust, dirt, crumbs, and everything else on my floor all while leaving it looking refreshed and new!  I was pretty skeptical about something that could pick up all debris and mop at the same time.  This works!! This is going to save me hours of time and energy!  This is great for cleaning all my floors at once or spot cleaning. I have a feeling that this will be used daily.  It is lightweight, very simple to use and does a phenomenal job. I didn’t want to spend the money on this, but I am so glad I did. My wood floors look new after just a few minutes. I used it in my bathroom as well, and it’s light tile in there. Everything shows up on that tile, the crosswave did an amazing job on my tile as well.Don’t hesitate to make this purchase. You won’t regret it.",4
Tricia C. Walters,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST cleaning machine I ever bought. Now horrified my apartment floors were THIS dirty.,the United States,9-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Good grief. I had no idea my floors were THIS dirty until I tried my Bissell CrossWave Floor and Carpet Cleaner for the first time. Normally it takes me about 1.5 hours to 2 hours to clean my 2-bedroom apartment (which is mostly tiled flooring) - including vacuuming and then washing floors. I did both in under 35 minutes. My apartment is large so I had to refill the water tank at back twice and I used the liquid cleaner included in package (little bottle lasts two fill-ups). I'm posting a photo because I felt quite ill after seeing how dirty the water was. Before I was using the Bissell twin tank steamer, but obviously it's got nothing on this big green cleaning super machine. LOL. My new nickname for it. I must admit though I did a once over on the large rug in my living room. I have two cats and one has long hair. She sheds something fierce so a lot of this was her hair which is really gross. I might have to vacuum first next time to pick up the bulk of her fur before using my machine. But honestly this machine exceeded my expectations. The fact that I managed to clean and vacuum the apartment in just over half an hour is astounding to me. Thanks Bissell.",One

My floors are super clean and I threw out really gross dirty water.  The clean water lasts over a larger area than I thought it would.  I'll have to fool around with it to see why it just looks like very little water is used.  So it's a good machine and does what it says.  It sucks up my small rugs, so I'm not sure I can do them.  The biggest bummers are that there's not a lot of reach for under furniture-the machine doesn't fold flat enough.  And it doesn't do corners.  I'm sure none of them do .  I would recommend buying one.",10

The dirty tank was disgusting when I dumped it and I keep my floors pretty clean!Pros- easy to use! Took a multi step process and put it in one. Cleaned my floors very well. It is super easy to keep clean.Cons(hate to say cons because they weren’t that bad)A couple times it did not suck up a larger piece of something (such as a piece of dog food) but I went over it again and it did. I can see how people may say it left streaks but after it dried it looked fine. I could see one spot after it dried but nothing that looks terrible (I have grey flooring)Hope it lasts forever.

G. Bolts,1.0 out of 5 stars,So unbelievably loud loud loud,the United States,28-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this after doing tons of research on what I needed for a house with all tile floors and was beyond excited about it.  I am disappointed to realize that Bissell must have given away thousands of this machine for free in order to build up the good reviews. It cleans but not spectacularly so for a floor that wasn’t very dirty to begin with. What nobody will tell you is that in a house of all hard floors, this machine is so obnoxiously and unbelievably loud. With all hard floors the echo can be heard from every room. If you thought you were going to run it while the baby naps or the kids are sleeping, FORGET IT. If your dog is terrified of vacuums, don’t buy this. It is SO loud. Just loud with many layers to it. However, this is probably the right machine for you if you have very quickly dirtied carpets, wear shoes in the house, have multiple dogs running in and out. It can definitely keep your house clean. If you are a new mom just looking to get the milk off the floor after each meal, I personally am much happier with a $99 steam mop that I CAN run without waking the dead. This was the wrong machine for my needs but I can appreciate that it is meant for people with extremely dirty floors.",One

Even though we have a robot vacuum that runs 2 times a day, I usually have to vacuum before I mop and still get stuck with dog hair in the corners creating a nasty mess. This machine is AMAZING. I don't mind holding down the mop button, it is in a very natural location on the handle. It does exactly what it says it is supposed to! I absolutely love  how the tank holds enough water to only need to refill once to do all the bedrooms and the main house.  I am very pleased and the only thing I would change would be a retractable cord holder or make it battery operated.",

I used mine every single day and was in LOVE, but it died after only 4 months of constant use. When I contacted Bissell, they referred me to a repair shop, when they should really be offering a new product or refund, because this machine (now) is notorious for issues.

But it doesn't have very intense suction, and I spend more time unclogging and cleaning it then I do on the floors.  I am super disappointed and frustrated with it, honestly  I hate to leave crappy reviews, but this one is for a $300 machine.  I don't just have $300 lying around and it really made me sad to realize this thing wasn't up to par.  It gets dirty very quickly and it begins to smear dirty water around instead of cleaning the floor properly.  I then have to stop, clean it really well, rinse the roller, wring out any excess water, and then start again.  The dogs' hair keeps it from sucking anything up so quickly, I have to, again, stop and find a way to pull all the dog hair and dirt out of the tiny suction tube, and then start again.  Sometimes, it is pretty ok, but I truly expected more.  Cleaning my floors is more of a chore than it was to begin with.  Really sad about it.  I really wanted this lil' machine to work better than my broom and mop.",

The problem with both of mine is the brush does not want to spin and it is wearing away the plastic on the left creating a burning smell. I replace the brushes often.

The broom part is so short that it makes the mopping process take so much longer. If the head was wider it would be much more efficient. The sides of the mop pick up really well but the very front has a gap of where it cleans. So when I go up against a wall I can’t go straight up to it, I have to go along it with the sides otherwise it doesn’t get up along the wall; there is a gap where nothing was cleaned.

However, it is convenient and if you have time and run it slowly then it will do a decent job cleaning up. I wish the suction power is a bit stronger. The spray does malfunction at times and leaves a streak of detergent on the floor. If the suction was stronger then it would be a better product. It also isn’t able to hit the edges and corners either so you have to go back and wipe down the edges and corner by hand.

This is why I chose to have extra filter and brush on hand because we have 3 dogs and 7 cats and live in a wooded area, so I need to use it every day, sometimes twice a day.  I love that I can vacuum and clean at the same time.  This is a huge timesaver for me and I really love using it.  My Floors get very dirty.  They should have used my floors for their testing they would really see how great it works.  I almost want to get another one for the upper floor of house to just keep up there.

I was worried that the Bissell CrossWave rotating scrubbers vs the spin brushes would not clean as well, but that has not been the case.  I only have laminate flooring, so I can not compare if there is a difference on tile but I can tell you I am very pleased with the cleaning of my floors.  The thing I like the most about the Bissell vs Hoover is that the Bissell does a much better job at drying the floors and not leaving a dirty puddle after turning the machine off.  I have used it on an area rug as well, and I could have never done that with my Hoover FloorMate.  I also think the Bissell is much easier to clean out after each use and I no longer think of it as a hassle (compared to the Hoover).  I highly recommend the Bissell CrossWave.",

THANK YOU!Also,when returning i am going to have to bend the handle to fit it in the box.this handle should have a release button for repacking, in my humble opinion.",One
Brianna,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great for like 3 times... dud.,the United States,5-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This vacuum worked great the first 3 times or so. Now it just doesn’t suction or pick up the water. I’ve taken it apart. Cleaned everything. I did have a small clog but it’s still just not working. Maybe I got a dud but it’s an expensive one.,2
Gary H,3.0 out of 5 stars,Check for a serial number and don’t let Amazon pass the buck to Bissell; they are useless.,the United States,14-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The product was great until the soap solution bottle cap came off and stuck in the machine. I worked for 2 hours trying to get it out without making the problem worse. Called Amazon; they referred me to Bissell for help. They were rude and claimed it was owner neglect; I eat silica drying packets as well. When they asked for a serial number it was missing. I have a feeling I bought a refurbished unit and paid for new. After 20 minutes of lousy Muzak they said call Amazon to resolve it. All of this 10 days after the machine arrived. Amazon replaced with a different machine; it has a serial #. It cleans very well; ear plugs required.,One
Lady of the LAN,1.0 out of 5 stars,oof.,the United States,22-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Well, the first time I used it on a spot on the carpet. The second time I used it on a rug and it barely cleaned anything and left a dirty soaking wet rug for me to deal with. It's also very difficult to push and pull this cleaner and there is not a floor height adjustment setting that I could find anywhere. Thankfully I also have a SpotBot so I used the hose attachment on that to suck up as much water and cleaning solution as I could. I've only ever purchased Bissell floor cleaning products, but I think this purchase was my last.",
Courtney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!!! The suction is crazy Amazing!!,the United States,21-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It’s a bit heavy and clunky if you’re picking it up, but it’s SO worth it. The suction on this thing is AMAZING. My dog decided to pee on the floor while I was mopping so I sucked it up and I could see the pee just vaporizing and being sucked in. So much better than the One Power from Hoover. Wish I got this one first! Comes with 2 brushes, 2 filters. There is mesh or something as like an extra filter in spots so only water can get through. Picks up hair tremendously. My floors are spotless! I have 5 animals and this does the job!!!",
Brian Sullivan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Jack of all trades, master of none.",the United States,15-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Kinda disappointed with this purchase.Its kinda light and portable... but not as portable as some of the cordless liion battery vacuums.Its got some power.. but not as much power as more beefy vacuums.Has water setup to clean hard floors.. but not good as like actually mopping.Has water setup you can use on rugs/carpets.. but not nearly as good as a carpet shampooer.So it kinda does it all.. but everything it does its kinda meh at everything it does..,One
Cherry Blossoms Spa,1.0 out of 5 stars,Regret my purchase,the United States,19-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is easy to assemble. It’s light weight an$ easy to handle. The finger pull for the cleaning fluid is easy to accidentally pull when you only want to vacuum. It wouldn’t be a big deal but every time you use it, you need to clean the roller and the dirty water collector. It’s a huge mess. I wanted to be able to vacuum daily to pick up in dog hair from my area rug. It pushes 5he hair around rather than picking it up. And my biggest frustration is when vacuuming, when you pull it towards you, it dumps all the dirt on the floor. I end up sweeping after I vacuum. I’m going to look into returning it but that’s a hassle too.",One
JARTX,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Vacuum is ok, but ""mop"" feature is not.",the United States,4-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was hoping to shorten vacuum/mop time for my tile floors with this. As others have pointed out, the edge cleaning isn't very good and it actually takes me more time to use this than my regular stick vacuum then mop. My floors are darkish and the streaks are terrible, plus it spits out dirty water sometimes. This was a total letdown. Back to the vacuum then mop combo. One good thing is the vacuum works ok, so I can donate it to someone needing a vacuum cleaner. I wouldn't recommend trying to get a clean floor with this.",
Melissa ONeil,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the aggravation,the United States,19-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Used maybe 4-5 times and it worked well on both area rugs and laminate flooring.  I cleaned fully in between uses... all of a sudden would not turn on. Apparently it was/is a common issue with this product. Tried all suggestions from Bissel and internet searches (short of taking motor apart). In the end Bissel wanted me to return to them (on me) or certified repair (closest is over an hour away) for them to troubleshoot and/or repair (although as long as it was a defect it would be free of charge)... put enough time/money into this was not paying for shipping back to them. Not worth the time and effort... swifter wet is cheaper and I don’t need to worry about power running out (unless I count my own lol),2
Chef,5.0 out of 5 stars,This machine is perfect!!,the United States,27-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The perfection lies in; ease of use, spectacular results and so little cleanup. I was searching for a floor cleaner that did not  spread dirty water around, and let it collect in grout lines (eventually staining it). The Crosswave sprays clean water, suctions dirty water back into the machine(dirty water tank)! Voila! Ive been maintaining floors for 50 years! This Crosswave is King!! I love NOT having to charge/run out of power. The compact lightweight design really tops it off as perfect!",
Haney Family,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for 3 little kids,the United States,18-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"With three kids 4 and under, my floors are always a mess. I was tired of getting on my hands and knees every day to scrape up old banana chunks and stuff. This tool (vacuum? Mop? Mopcuum?) changed it all.

Rachel Schutz,1.0 out of 5 stars,HORRIBLE,the United States,28-Oct-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This machine was a huge waste of money! I only used it about 4-5 times before it became unusable.I purchased this because I really liked that I could vacuum and ""mop"" using the wet/dry feature at the same time. The problem is, when you think about it, by using the wet feature and adding water, you're adding water to dust which makes a mess inside your system. My main complaint is its impossible to  dry the inside of the machine as well as the roller head so when you use it, it makes your whole house smell like WET FEET as the parts are wet from prior use. I purchased a replacement roller head thinking that would solve the problem, still stunk when fired up. Now, its not even picking up dirt, just blowing it around. HORRIBLE PURCHASE.I called Bissell to return under the one year warranty- they just passed the buck back to Amazon. I'll likely throw it in the trash. HUGE WASTE of money and now I have to fill a landfill with Bissell's junk. STAY AWAY from this piece of crap.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The very best floor cleaner,the United States,18-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the first product I have ever reviewed so you know it's top notch.  I have a Golden Retriever in Florida who goes in and out her dog door multiple times a day.  Lots of sand and dirt, lots of dog hair.  the first time I used my Crosswave I decided to put it to the test.  I pre-cleaned my hardwood floors, mats, area rugs and tile floor in kitchen as I usually do.  They looked clean.  Then using multi-floor cleaner I used my new crosswave over the floors I had just finished cleaning.  I couldn't believe the black discard water, the hair and sand that the roller picked up. It was like I hadn't cleaned at all.  I finally have found the answer to a clean house.  TIP:  Read the directions throughly before you start and when you put water in the roller pan at end to clean the roller, keep adding water, let the machine really clean that roller well.  Also have a small plastic tub to store all the parts you have rinsed so they can stay together and properly dry in your closet. Easy and well worth the process.  Beautiful floors, no more grit.",
Aravis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working properly,the United States,21-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My Bissel Crosswave worked great for about a month.  Then I hurt my back and it sat for about 2 months.  When I started using it again, it smelled like burning plastic and didn't clean as well as it had in the past.  I gave it a thorough cleaning, not just the easy way shown in the preview video, and tried it again.  Same thing.  I have tried it several times since and wish I had gotten the extended warranty, because it is unusable.",2
HWB,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MACHINE!!!!,the United States,3-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I didn’t know it was possible to fall in love with an appliance, yet, here I am completely enthralled with my CrossWave!  We have a breezeway between our house and garage that has thermal finished granite on it.  It gets a lot of wear and dirt tracked around.  I hate cleaning it so much, I generally only mop it once a year . . . And it takes 4-5 hours to do a good job.  I’ve tried the wet vac the last couple of times I did it and got frustrated with the water left in the grout.  Last year, I didn’t clean it, so this Spring it was an incredible mess!  I ordered the CrossWave with high hopes of clean floors and easy work . . . . AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!  Today I used it on interior granite tile and also my hardwood floors.  The results were beautiful. I did purchase the Bissell Wood Floor cleaner, but I made granite tile cleaner, filling hot water to first line, regular rubbing alcohol to 2nd line, a few drops of Dawn dishwashing liquid and essential oil.  Results on polished granite tile were wonderful! - The Woman of the House",One
Donna Cook,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does pretty good,the United States,28-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I like this vacuum mop.  It does pretty good.  It’s fun to use.  I decided to get the corded one because I figured the battery life on the other one wouldn’t last long enough for my liking.  The cord is no problem at all.  It’s pretty long.  The only two things I’m not crazy about is it doesn’t get up to the edges of the wall very well, and I don’t like cleaning it afterwards.  It’s not that big of a deal.  Doesn’t take long and isn’t hard to do.  I just don’t like doing it.  You don’t have to sweep first but I would recommend it to keep the cleaning process not as icky after you’re finished.  I would recommend.  It does what it’s supposed to do.",One
Coils&Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible machine! Not for carpet!,the United States,12-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Horrible. I purchased this product for mainly my carpets and it does a horrible job picking up even the smallest particles. I have to use so much arm strength and energy just to have to go back and pick up the remaining trash (which is always a lot) by hand. Why use a vacuum cleaner if I have to go behind it and clean up! I haven’t used it on my hardwoods but I have way more carpet in my house than hardwood. Total waste of money. I wish I would have returned it. I realized how bad it was the very first time I used it but thought I would try it a few more times and now it’s too late to try. I just got done using it and it reminded how much I hate this thing. For the amount of money spent I thought I would get a quality product!,One
Karrie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing in all regards,the United States,16-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I initially used product on brick flooring, thought I ruined the roller after one use.Ordered new roller and filter, used on hand-scraped hardwood. Had to redo entire room because of streaks and dog slobber spots still on floor. My Shark Steam mop does the job in 1/4 of the time and floors shine afterwards.Additionally, this product leaves about a 1” gap from any edge, and cannot get under furniture- I have a 14” bed frame that I had to redo with my Shark steam mop.Trying to change roller is awkward, machine is hard to clean and forget about it if there is any pet hair on the ground - filter clogs very quickly.Roller cover corner broke off 3rd time I removed for cleaning.Do not recommend.

Aulanda Sutherland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it!,the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Oh I'm so pleased with this purchase! It replaced my microfiber mop and swiffer vaccum. I was very skeptical of its usefulness but I'm so glad that I got this. It vacuumed up the hair and mopped, so I didn't have to over the floor twice. The suction is nice. It was to strong to use on my light weight throw rug at the back door.  I will say that the clearance of the vaccum is too high to get under some of my furniture, so I'll have to sweep some areas then use this vac/ mop. It's easy to take a prt any clean after using it. Basically, worth the purchase so far.",
Kyle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Revolutionary. No exaggeration.,the United States,30-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is legit the best vacuum I’ve ever used. I saw a commercial for it and strategically told my husband about it just in time for Christmas and y’all: IT DOES EVERYTHING IT SAYS IT’S GONNA DO. Vacuums and mops hard floors AND rugs. Cut my floor-cleaning time in half which, in a 3500 square-foot house full of puppy hair and messy eaters, is not insignificant. So really it’s like I got gifted extra hours. It maneuvers well— fits under the fridge door and everything— and is easy to clean. Like if I can figure this sh*t out, it’s definitely user-friendly. So if you’re considering getting one, you can stop now and just buy the thing.",One
Claire,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Too much work to maintain, makes a high pitched noise and doesn't clean very well",the United States,29-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"A big problem with this is that because it accomplishes too tasks, it vacuums plus mops, it gets all sort of grit in the water, leaving you to wonder what to do with all that crap. You can't just dump it in the yard or in the trash, but I really do wonder what dumping that dirty water in the pipes could do to your plumbing. It's very odd. Let alone having to clean the darn thing every time you use it. And it doesn't scrub well, and the edges of it don't work well. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it!",4
MM,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning!,the United States,22-Jun-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"After watching some YouTube videos and seeing how well it performed there I decided to break loose of a buck and by this crosswave. As soon as I got it unboxed I filled the water and solution tank and went to it. It worked fantastically! Just like advertised. It  vacuums very well and as far as the wet cleaning, I couldn't be happier with its performance. The only drawback that I could find was the machine is heavy. My house is only 1200 square feet and all of the floors are either tile or laminate. After cleaning the entire floored surface in my house I have to admit that even though I'm a pretty strong guy my arm was tired. That's a very small price to pay for the amazing job that this machine does. I do think that it's probably a little overpriced at close to $250 but if it last 10 years I would consider it a great Buy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Nice job Bissell!",One
Elizabeth Carne,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine losses suction, and can't be fixed.",the United States,4-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"BUYERS BEWARE I absolutely loved my cross wave, in the beginning. After 6 months the suction stopped picking up the solution it put down, let alone picking up anything else. I replaced the filter, the brush and cleaned everything after each use. I can feel the suction, but apparently it isn't strong enough to pick up anything else. After spending $250, it's going to the dump. The reviews I've read and the research I've done, all say the same thing. This product has serious design flaws. I raved about my cross wave in the beginning, but after a short time the machine is worthless. Very disappointed.",3
monica williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaner than sweeping and mopping. I have children and pets. Works Great!,the United States,11-Sep-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have been using this model for 2 years now. I have always had a great experience with bissell products. I bought this because of having limited mobility plus sweeping and mopping exhausts me very easily. I also have 3 children dogs and cats. I needed something efficient and effective. There is a considerable difference to my floors when I use this compared with mopping. It really gets all the hair dirt up. I would highly recommend it. Yes it is yucky to clean but not so bad when you realize that yuck is no longer on your floor. A couple of important tips for anyone using this. Buy the replacement filters and rollers. Change as needed. ALWAYS clean and empty this after use and before storing. Otherwise the next time you use it, you will have yucky floors (just like mopping with a dirty mop). The floor cleaner for this is great.  I am getting a new one but mostly to upgrade. This has made my life so much easier.",

Upon the first use of this machine (my new best friend), the water looked like gray chocolate milk, which I strained prior to dumping down the drain.  There was almost an ENTIRE CUPFUL of sludge, sand, hair, and debris in the strainer!  This thing must've sucked stuff up from between the tiny cracks.  Were there some streaks? Yes, but I would expect this until I go over it a couple times and maintain it. Even if there are a couple of streaks, this thing, obviously, deep cleans.",One

Sesame,5.0 out of 5 stars,Believe the hype!,the United States,26-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It is very satisfying to clean with this vacuum. It may be a turn-off that the parts of the vacuum must be cleaned after each use, but it does serve as evidence of all that has been removed during the cleaning and it's pretty impressive. I wish the bin for cleaning solution was larger so I could get more mileage out of each use but that is a small issue. I am equally satisfied with cleaning quality and results on hardwood versus rug versus tile. I recommend without hesitation!",
Noone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"FINALLY,!!",the United States,20-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have purchased every machine there is, I swear.  I had given up finding something that would clean our horrible pergo and area rug floors quickly and easily.  Life is too short to spend it cleaning the floor!  We also have lots of those awesome two level waterhog area rugs that are impossible to clean even with our monster vacuum.  This machine WORKS!  Filthy, filthy water comes out.  Scary.  If you have lots of dog hair, you might want to do a quick vacuum of the rugs (especially the waterhogs) and the corners - dog owners know what i mean.  You don't have to, but you will empty the water a lot less.  My 90 year old aunt can run it.  Buying more rollers so we can clean them easier.  Wish i could give 10 stars.  I HATE ALL CLEANING.

JustJudy,5.0 out of 5 stars,What I was looking for,the United States,29-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We have tile floors throughout our home.

Despite being a 2 person and 2 small dog home it's surprising how dirty the water is. Overall I am pleased with this appliance. **I bought the pet brushes to use so the hair from our chihuahua gets picked up without having to buy the more expensive Bissell pet model. Recommend,
R. Oxhorn,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning the machine is a chore,the United States,19-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a great machine for quick cleanup’s. I love the way I can get rid of smudges, paw prints and water spots. It does leave your floor squeaky clean. But, this machine gets very dirty. The holding tank needs more than just a rinse out. You need to use a sponge to wipe the residue off the insides of the tank. The tray below the roller brush gets very muddy. And the roller brush itself really needs to be soaped up and hosed down.  Be prepared to clean this machine often because neglecting it will actually make it smelly.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and great for life with small children!,the United States,18-Oct-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely abhor sweeping and mopping. It's my least favorite household chore. But with the crosswave it's really easy. It's easy to assemble, clean, and quickly picks up messes. If you have lots of spills of sticky things, light tile,  or hardwood floors I would suggest this. My one pet peeve about it is that sometimes the spicket where the water comes out gets clogged with dirt and when that happens the entire machine doesn't work. I had to call the customer service (which was really helpful) just to troubleshoot and figure out that the water not coming out was due to a clog in this small part. Overall I love this and am so glad it's easy for me and my 6 year old to clean with.",2
Zpatel08,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money!,the United States,8-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Purchased this less than a month ago and I absolutely love it! The mop is a little loud but so is a regular vacuum cleaner,  so its ok. But the suction power is awesome. We still haven't started our cleaning service back up yet since covid shut down. So with everyone home, my floors needed a good scrubbing and this mop definitely did thr trick. Not only thr floors got clean, the solution didn't leave my floors sticky after drying. An additional plus for me is the fact that every comes apart so you can clean it out. The packaging also came with an extra scrubbing brush, and filter. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.",
Glo S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it.,the United States,12-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is definitely a quality machine.  Whether it's worth the trouble of assembling, disassembling and cleaning the removable parts is a question of how much time you have, what you're using it for, etc.  I use it sometimes for my hard kitchen and bathroom floors but it doesn't replace an old-fashioned mop for getting into corners, along baseboards, etc.  However, I do use it regularly to ""spot-clean"" my very light carpeting and throw rugs.  Much easier than getting down on hands and knees to use a spray spot-cleaner, so I do it more often--my carpets look much nicer.  It actually pulls more cat hair and other debris out of my carpet than my regular upright vacuum does--but it means you have wet debris in the rollers and bin, which is a bit messy to clean out.Overall, this is a somewhat pricey investment considering it does not, for me, completely replace my regular mop or vacuum.  But I do use it often enough, and it seems sturdy enough, that I'm sure the cost will be worth it in the long run.  And my rugs do look very nice!",One
Rosemary',4.0 out of 5 stars,Great on floors,the United States,27-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This really saves you one step on hard surface.. it vacuums and washes in one step.  I use on it vinyl and tile and it works great.  I tried on carpet.. not so great.  You do have to take it apart to clean it.. but it's a lot easier than washing floors on your hands and knees.  I am always amazed at how dirty the water it that it sucks up!  I ordered the refill cleaner from Bissell because there was a coupon with the machine, but could not apply the coupon online.  I called and they sent my cleaner out right away at a 50% discount.  Thanks Bissell!  PS... love what you do for the dogs, too!",
M B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is pretty awesome.,the United States,18-Mar-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The cons: it’s a bit loud. Takes a few passes to get dried liquid marks.The pros: cleans tile well, including wide grout lines. Leaves little enough water that its safe for wood floors. Did a good job on my 10mm pile length area rug when one of my dogs had an accident of substantial liquid volume. The rug brush didn’t fuzz up the twists and it cleaned well enough that there was no urine smell front or back of the rug after it was done. I did make many passes and put some extra water down to be safe but it worked better than I expected.Overall this thing has been great. I sweep or vacuum every other day because I’ve got dogs and toddlers but I do not bother to sweep immediately before using this. It really does pick up a lot of debris. I still have to get into the corners and ended with the vacuum or broom because it doesn’t do as well right at the edges but it does fit under a lot of things.",
Leo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Takes Some Time,the United States,24-Sep-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We have a lot of tile in the kitchen, halls and bathrooms.  It is a light colored textured tile.  Over the years, my wife's mopping would not remove the ground-in dirt.  So, I decided to take the cleaning challenge.  My first thought was that a good stiff bristle brush with a strong cleaner was required and I would have to get down on my knees like the old days and apply a lot of elbow grease.  Before taking that action, I decided to try a machine and settled on the CrossWave.  I've had the X-Wave for several weeks.  Every weekend I go over the floor.  After three or four weeks I am seeing good results.  I knew that one treatment was hoping for two much and figured multiple cleanings would be required.  I am satisfied with the floor at this point but I'll keep at it weekly and I'm sure the X-Wave will continue to work on the ground-in dirt.  The product meets my expectations.",2
zim,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and Works Well (so far),the United States,30-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"A few years ago I replaced all my carpets with hardwood and tile. I had a heavy duty Bissell vacuum cleaner that I had to lug downstairs to do the basement and then after vaccuming, get the mop to do upstairs & downstairs. I read the mixed reviews on Amazon, but I decided to give it a shot. My only regret is that 4 days after I purchased the Crosswave, the price went down $30 & Amazon wouldn't give me a rebate. I had to return & re-order which is ridiculous. Ok, back to the review. I have to say, after using the Crosswave 3 times, I am very impressed. My floors don't even look dirty before I use it, but the amount of dirt that winds up in the dirty water container amazes me. The Crosswave is much lighter than a regular vacuum cleaner. The cord is pretty long so I don't have to keep switching outlets when I go room to room. I have only used the Crosswave 3 times, so I can't review the longevity of this product, but it seems to be well made. My hardwood floors are definitely cleaner after using the Crosswave. i have tried the Multi Surface & the Wood cleaner on the hardwood floors. I am not sure if there is much of a difference. It is cleaner, but you won't get the same shine as you do with Murphy's, Pledge, or Mop n Glow. Then again, I don't mind because the floor looks clean no streaks, and if I want the shine, I can go over with any of those products & I really don't need to keep washing the mop out. I am not sure if you can mix any of those products in with the fresh water tank though. You would void the warranty, but I think the machine would probably still work. I am sure the cash cow for Bissell is selling the cleaning products. This is a must: You have to take the Crosswave apart after using it and rinse off all the parts & let them dry. And make sure to use a paper towel to wipe down the base. No scrubbing, just rinse, wipe, and let dry. (I use a drop of Dawn on the filter when I clean it- to prevent it from smelling).  If you're planning to use this more than once a day, I suggest buying  an extra roller and extra filter as it takes the better part of a day for the roller and filter to dry.",

She has been looking at new vacuums but she’s the kind of person who won’t spend over about $75 for anything for herself (and yes she considers cleaning supplies to be “for herself”) so I knew there was no way she would buy it but that it would be something she loved. As soon as she opened it, she was completely and totally in love with it. The next day she woke up extra early and did the entire house. She kept sending me pictures while I was at work about how well it did. We live on a farm and I have a teenage brother and my step dad who never take their shoes off when they come inside of the house so of course, they tend to track mud in everywhere.The majority of our house is made up of wood, then the kitchen and bathrooms have tile and finally the bedrooms have carpet. The most noticeable difference was actually the carpet, because this little tiny thing actually got out most of the mud stains that my mom never thought she could even almost get out.She loves the fact that now to do the wood and tile floors, this vacuum makes it a one step process. Used to, we would sweep, then vacuum, and then mop, and now all she had to do is fill up the vacuum with the solution and do what she normally would with a regular vacuum. It has very much simplified our Sunday’s.",One
Viktor76,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not best,the United States,24-Nov-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It's been a reliable vacuum until recently when part who drives the brush broke. Thankfully I have an insurance that'll cover it. Other than that, it's a good vacuum but not the best you can get. Hopefully, BISSEL improved the follow up-model. The plastic parts are very fragile and break easily when hitting furniture. The brush's a pain to clean. But besides that, it's a helpful tool when you have pets (with issues).",2
mecs,1.0 out of 5 stars,made rug worse,the United States,18-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a horrible machine. And after shampooing my rug about eight times, it looks worse than before I started. The rug is a cream background oriental style rug. It was pretty dirty with dust and muddiness, but now it has wide black stripes that won’t  go away. Regrettably, it’s too late to return this. But I’ll never buy another Bissel product. Now I need to replace the rug completely. I wish I had just sent it out to be cleaned professionally instead of wasting my money on this junk. Or at leasr that I had been aware that I needed to return it before a specific date.",
Tricia in the Trees,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good cleaner,the United States,29-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We retired to the foot of the Blue Mountains and are surrounded by Douglas fir trees which not only provide wonderful shade and wild life habitat but also shed little amber colored sticky tips that track in everywhere.  The wood for the stove manages to deposit pitch; dirt really likes pitch!  Selecting a light colored floor may have been a little optimistic and I’m cleaning the vinyl floor every other day.Nothing replaces hands and knees’ scrubbing but it is getting harder to get up and down so I tried a cleaner and after running a vacuum first and then going over the floor once to scrub and once to pick up the water; time consuming and hard to see where you’ve been.  I ordered a Cross Wave and tried it the first time; it does do a decent job of cleaning.  The second time I tried a little pre-treatment with a spray bottle of the cleaning mix on the spots and that improved the performance.  I did find using hearing protection advisable.The third time I pre-treated a lot and now we are on to something!  I can swamp the kitchen and clean it right up!,
Susan Blankenship,5.0 out of 5 stars,Barefoot Test.,the United States,4-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This has been a great investment. It cleans the floor as good as a broom and mops great as well. The floor passes the barefoot test. They feel clean after I have used the crosswave. I have a dog and it does great cleaning up her hair. The crosswave is light weight and easy to use. I wish I would have found out about these sooner.,2
Kristin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,7-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really liked it when I first got it but if my floors get even slightly dirty, it all collects on the bottom of the Bissell and it’s like I’m rubbing mud all over my floor. Also, I’ve cleaned it thoroughly numerous times and for some reason when I use it now, it smells like mildew really bad. I’ve replaced the roller, the filter, I even cleaned the entire inside of it with bleach and it still has that smell when I turn it on. I don’t even use it anymore.",2
Cyndie G.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too expensive to use and misses lots of areas,the United States,9-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a great idea, however for me it was a waste of hard earned money. It doesn’t get corners or sides. The only cleaner allowed is $20 per bottle. If you do not go slow you make a mess. The brush cover is so hard to pull off I have to have my son do it because I do not have the strength. Coffee drips on my tile and it takes 3-4 passes to get it cleaned up. I have used it 6 times and I’m putting in a yard sale.  Wish I had my money back this was a waste. A mop and bucket work better. The bissell having  a vacuum and cleaner is the perfect solution but this machine is not the answer",3
ealovitt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best floor cleaner I've ever had, but...",the United States,24-Sep-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Seriously, those Swiffer ads really bug me, because there's no vacuum to pick up dirt.  I swiffered my floors, then used this Bissell CrossWave, and sucked up a full container of really dirty water, not to mention wads of cat hair.  I've been cleaning my floors with it for four months now, and I can state that the Crosswave is easy to use and really, really cleans my floors.  There are only two minor problems I'd like to mention:(1)  If you really want to clean the Crosswave after using it, I've found the best way to do it is take the Crosswave outside, empty the dirty water container, then hose down all of the parts involved in picking up the grime, including the little tube that runs from the brush assembly to the dirty water container.  I'm not sure how I'm going to clean my Crosswave in the winter.  I'll probably use the basement sink.(2) The roller brush wears out rather quickly (see customer image.  The brush on the left has been used about five times).  Be sure to purchase a spare brush.",
Amanda D,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST THING IVE EVER PURCHASED!,the United States,19-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I swear this is the best thing I have in my home right now. With 5 children and 4 animals our floors always have heavy traffic but this right here, lord. It's a blessing! I have never been so okay with my children eating in their highchair and throwing food around on the floor because the days of picking up the mushed up food before mopping is over! It picks up everything yall! Now you do have to take it apart to clean it after every use BUT it's so easy, my 14 year old can do it! I will say buying the extra brushes and filters for this comes in handy when you need to use it alot in one day in different rooms. You don't have to wait for drying, you can just change out the brush and filter and be good to go. But it!!!",
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,7-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was unsure about this product and waited a long time to spend the $. I must say it has done nothing but impress me! We have almost all laminate flooring and grandkids under 6 yrs old. This is so helpful in that it does sweep and mop at the same time. Keep in mind that you will need to sweep up anything large or potentially damaging to your machine as it is a “wet vac”, but I must say I LOVE the fact that I do not have to break out the broom when there has been a spill I just grab my Bissell. I was unsure on the carpet feature but have used it once and it worked well. I do not like that you have to take it apart to clean it, but that’s a small price to pay for all of the benefits!",
Queen,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG Just buy it & thank me later,the United States,10-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So the only issue I had was the suction power is “little” lacking but dude you are sweeping and mopping at the SAME time so what do you expect?This is an amazing lightweight little mechanical genius plus you are saving homeless animals!!! I am so in love and I love how much crap it got off of my living room floor, kitchen tile, dining room tile, room floor, and bathroom tile. Yay!!!!! Easy clean up too!!! Just read directions and put on some hip hop. Even dance with your pets. So much fun cleaning now!!!!",
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap quality...doesn't last!,the United States,16-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My cousin bought one about 3 years ago and is very happy with hers, so I bought one because of her recommendation and its advertised versatility to be used on both hard floors and carpets. After some minor assembly I tried it on our kitchen tiles. It did a great job. Two days later I tried to use it on a carpet, and it was not working properly. The cleaner turned on but would not turn off. Also, the cleaning fluid would no longer dispense. After going through all the trouble shooting recommendations from both the manual and a call with Bissell, I returned it for replacement. The replacement acted the exact same way…worked as advertised the first use then exhibited the same two issues a day later. Thankfully Amazon issued a complete refund. Obviously, Bissell is having a quality issue with the newer models so avoid purchasing this product as you will only be disappointed!",One
Frustrated Lady,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm in Love!,the United States,14-Mar-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is great for cleaning floors.  I have a large area to clean.  Kitchen and hearth room both all open concept.  My husband brings grime into the house via the garage off of the kitchen.  It is a never ending battle to keep up with the cleaning. I also have birds to clean up after, and this machine will be a great help when cleaning in their room.  I am always looking for easy ways to keep on top of things. This machine gets top rating in my book, however I have to say that this machine is pretty noisy.  I can live with the noise, if it gets me good results.  I can always use earplugs when vacuuming. The floor dries quickly and the machine is easy to clean.  You just have to read the books on how to put it together, and how to operate this machine. (Not difficult either). I would highly recommend this machine to anyone, who wants a clean floor without all the work.  THANKS BISSELL!  Good job.",
Kayla Sutton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Throw out whatever mop you are using and buy this one!,the United States,27-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love my Bissell Crosswave. I have 3 cats and a dog. My dog is part Husky and Lab. He sheds very often. This mop and vaccum is great for cleaning up all dirt, litter, and hair thats left behind on my hard floors. I love my crosswave and can always trust my family is walking on clean floors. All Bissell solution smells great and leaves a fresh scent behind. Machine is extremely easy to clean up. I clean it every time I use it. Most parts go in my dishwasher on a cycle by its own, and I toss the scrub roll into the washing machine. Definitely recommend.",
Shaleen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Clogs eaily,the United States,3-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love that you can vacuum carpet and hardwood and mop with this! The first time I used it, it worked amazing but after that it seems to get clogged every time I use it, so it's not picking stuff up as good. You do have to clean it out after each use but the place it gets clogged is almost impossible to get to. I'd recommend sweeping up big stuff first to avoid clogs. Hair also gets stuck around the brush part, but it's removable and comes with an extra one so you have time to clean the dirty one and let it dry overnight!",
Kim O,5.0 out of 5 stars,He is more powerful than he looks.,the United States,13-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,He is a cute and light little guy.He is a little loud but gets the job done. Easy peasy to use. The top of the handle has a button for hard wood floor and one for carpet. Press one of them and it vacuums. Press the trigger and it dispenses the liquid. Let go of the trigger and it vacuums the liquid. It’s so easy to use!!  Every piece that is able to be disassembled pops in and out with ease. A very convenient piece is the top cover to the head. It pulls right off and the roller can be lifted out for easy cleanup. Let’s not forget he cleans 🧼 himself with water or soap in the tray and u vacuum it up. Definitely recommend!!,
Gooseylloosey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Has issues but I love it,the United States,11-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The machine cannot be repaired, they do not have parts for this so you are on your own if you need to repair it.I bought mine over 2 yrs ago. Back and forth with customer service, finally sent them pictures of the problem. They can send you a replacement crosswave of their choice, I received a blue crosswave which was not what I wanted so sent that back, and they did send me a new crosswave the green color machine. It does a great job on cleaning my floors, I can see and smell the freshness. It does throw out some dirty spots but I have learn to go over it and it picks it up. That’s my only complaint. It still cleans so much better and so light weight, which is great for my back. I love the machine. I have gotten faster in cleaning the machine. If you want something to last a long time you have to clean it. The machine only cleans the brush not suppose to clean the whole machine it isn’t like an oven cleaning that you still have to clean after it’s done too.It is still going after 2 years. I have a wet jet swifter for maintenance. But this machine just does a great job in making my floors shine and smell good. Every machine out there isn’t perfect, all have issues. But I get around it and makes me happy.",11
Amy M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mopping apparently doesn’t clean your floors at all!,the United States,29-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My floors are finally clean! The amount of dirt I have gotten off my floors is mind blowing. And this was after I had just cleaned them a few days earlier!Pay attention to the instructions, and know that if the machine turns off on its own, it’s time to empty and clean out the dirty water receptacle. Unplug the machine, and make sure you get any gunk out from the “float” that may cause it to stick. Also, if you do use this on something REALLY dirty, do the self cleaning steps often, to remove dirt and debris from the roller brush. You have two brushes, so you can change them out to finish cleaning if you need to.",One

I'm a single mom of 3 so I do ALOT of multi-tasking and I have hardwood floors throughout my home so I'm constantly cleaning my floors, I love how they put sweeping and moping and put it together so it took half the time to do my floors.

JWP,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product and much better than Hoover equivalent,the United States,27-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Would recommend this product.  We initially bought an expensive Hoover system that failed after the 2nd use.  Only got a run around from Hoover when we tried to get a replacement.  Will not EVER buy a Hoover product again.This floor cleaner works great and we have had no issues with extensive use.  Works on tile and hardwood floors.Highly recommend.,One
Rachel M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hardwood floors!,the United States,26-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If your floors are as gross as ours (two dogs and a muddy yard), you will definitely appreciate this vacuum.  I’ve so far used it once to clean an area rug and once to clean our hardwood floors.  I’m happy with the results on both.  It didn’t give our a rug the same deep clean that a carpet cleaner would, but there was definitely an improvement.  Worked wonderfully on the hardwood floors, however you should expect to clean out the vacuum roller a couple of times if you have a large area and lots of dog hair.  I saw other reviews that complained about streaks; I had a bit of streaking as the roller got dirty, but once I cleaned the roller and went back over the area they were gone.  A bit more work than I originally anticipated when purchasing this, but it’s still way less of a hassle than using a bucket and mop and is way more effective (as evidenced by the dirty water tank)",One
M. D. Wallace,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a great floor cleaner,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"A coworker recommended this for floor cleaning, so I thought I'd give it a try. I've used a Swiffer wet jet on my kitchen floor, as well as a Shark steam cleaner. This got the floor cleaner with less effort. Way less. It cleaned stuff I had forgotten were not part of the floor pattern. I love this thing. I have not tried it on rugs yet, so I have no idea how well it does them, but that's not what I got it for, so I don't really care how well it works on rugs. This thing rocks!",
Deborah McDiarmig,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING MACHINE,the United States,4-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this in an effort to make cleaning my tile floors simple and quick.  Those heave bulky machines are too much for me to push around and the old fashion mops were a chore to use.  This machine is amazing and i LOVE IT!!it is light weight, easy to use, easy to clean, and wet mops and picks up animal hair great.  I have 2 dogs that shed pretty badly and a long hair cat so i usually do a quick vacuum of my tile floor with my regular sweeper to get the bulk of it than go through and wet mop the tile floors and it not only cleans them amazing it picks up the rest of the hair with ease.  After use the cleaning is a breeze it comes apart easily.  there are no hidden areas that you cannot clean out.  I would recommend this as the best overall wet/dry vacuum that i have ever used (and i have purchased all of them with disappointment).  my whole entire house is tiling so i have a lot of areas to mop.i now mop the floors 2-3 times a week it is so easy.

I immediately assembled the unit and put the cat in the bathroom to give it a try.  I was so pleasantly surprised by how well this cleaned and vacuumed.  There were a couple of places where it looked “streaky” but I just washed back over those.  I knew my hardwood floors were really dirty and my previous method of brooms, vacuums and wet Swiffers wasn’t getting the job done.The unit was also easy to clean after use and stores neatly in my little laundry room, taking up hardly any space at all (it fits behind my drying rack in previously unused space).The durability over time will be my only question, but I am very pleased thus far.",One

Husband vacuums and I follow with the Crosswave.  It cleans our vinyl floors beautifully.  Picks up the fine dirt the vacuum missed.  It's easy to take apart and clean.  I highly recommend it.Update:  Still lovin this!  To clean it after use, I put it in the shower and use the hand shower to rinse each piece.  Let them dry for a few minutes and store all pieces on a plastic winter boot tray.  Far better than using the plastic tray it comes with.  That went in the recycle bin.",8
Cody Colliver,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed!,the United States,22-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have only had this vacuum for a few days and have used it 3 times. I am in LOVE. There are only 2 down sides that I have seen. The cord is pretty short, but I think it is worth the money saved on the cordless model. Also, it will leave streaks on some floors. Our downstairs has luxury vinyl, and there is no streaking. However, upstairs we have a high quality laminate and the wheels leave streaks. It’s barely noticeable if you vacuum with with the planks in stead of across them. The streaks don’t bother me as I know that my floor is much cleaner than ever before... see the photo for proof!",
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for white/light tile,the United States,29-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I had a different Bissell model that worked great for about 6 months then the motor seized.

Not for white tile. Returning ASAP,2
Susie Creamcheese,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell Crosswave,the United States,7-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just wanted to start by saying, I really like this machine. I fell in love with it when I saw the TV commercial, and then on Black Friday I knew I had to get it at $179.  It does a great job cleaning the floors and the rug (though you have to purchase the rug cleaning parts separate) but the one thing to keep in mind is that this is a high maintenance toy. First you clean the floor, ok, great. But then you clean the filter, then you clean the brush, then you clean the thing again by filling the tray with water and running the thing, then you clean the tray that you USED to clean the thing. It's a lot of cleaning to keep a vacuum like this clean. You'll want to clean it out. There will be tons of crud built up if you don't. All in all though, I think it's a great invention, and investment.",One
Tugdual LeBohec,1.0 out of 5 stars,Works well on clean floors only,the United States,23-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"When I received this vacuum cleaner, my home was clean and I thought it was a great unit. Then after a week or so I wanted to clean again and I observed that: suction rapidly collapses has the filter gets clogged with dust. When the filter is ok the conduit going to the dirt container gets clogged. The unit comes with a ""self cleaning tray"" while in fact it is a de-clogging device which I need to use several times each time I clean my small home. If the tray is clean initially then it is dirty after each time I use it and so I need to rince it before using it again. The most amusing part is the little cloud of dust I see in front of the head of the vacuum cleaner: it blows the dust up instead of sucking it up.  Additionally, the unit is quite complicated and difficult to clean. When I am not sure my floors are dirty, this vacuum makes it obvious by smearing the dirt around in long dark streaks. I am completely puzzled by the positive reviews which made me buy this unit.",
Anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still great,the United States,20-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My family has used this exact floor cleaner for years. I bought this one for myself after moving out, and I still think it's one of the best investments I could ever get for a home, no matter how big or small or how much carpet and hardwood there is. The dual cleaning modes on this lets you easily switch from hardwood to carpet. All the parts are easy enough to remove and clean as well.There are times when the suction fails to fully pick up dust that ""gets wet"" from the cleaner, but it congregates together into a clump that perfectionists like me can just easily run the cleaner over it again to try to suck it up, or just pick it up myself.Another minor problem is when hair gets stuck in the wheels that are meant to hold the brush. It's easy enough to remove tangled hair from the brush itself, but not so much for the turning portion that holds the brushroll. Eventually the wheel will stop turning because the tangled hair jams it. This problem may be subverted if you wait for the machine to dry and then remove the hair caught in the wheels very carefully and slowly. The important thing is to try to clear the debris every time so the wheels don't stop working.Other than the small details, this is still a great cleaner to have. Definitely better than breaking your back using a swifer to clean your floors. And the machine does a better job anyway.",
Amanda,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price tag,the United States,3-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have looked at many hard floor cleaners over the last year, read tons of reviews, and finally got sick of mopping my floors and bit the bullet and purchased the Bissell Crosswave. I am so glad that I did! I thought my floors were clean, minus the entry points, and it proved me very wrong. Review pics are from the dirtiest part of my house, the front entry. Floors are very clean, my only complaint is that the roller is too far back, so you end up with an inch of unclean surface along walls, pictured, which isn’t too horrible to clean up afterwards so I won’t dwell on it.",
Nemack,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the $$$,the United States,22-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Horrible engineering. Does not go under furniture. I  had to sweep prior to using under beds, night stands, chairs, sofas, etc. It does not pick up dirt it simply blows it around. It does NOT work on plush carpet or area rugs. We used the clean feature on an area rug with dog & cat hair. It cleaned the rug but the hair stuck to the roller. When went to wash the luxury vinyl around the rug the vacuum deposited all the dirty hair on the floor. I’m returning this and going back to my old, heavy Rainbow.",One
Maria Flores,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 in 1 cleaner,the United States,25-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Works well, not as loud as a standard vacuum. Tried it on tile and wood floor. Cleans some of the grout. And the wood floor I feel it leaves it looking shiny. When I would mop regular and you step on it after it dried it still left foot marks. Does not do this with the cross wave. Only thing I will say is I wish the dirty tank was bigger as it fills pretty fast and needs to be emptied. Purchased the brush for area rugs. I have a shaggy carpet and I felt if I didn’t keep it moving it would get stuck. My husband loves it and said it was a good investment.",
M. Verna,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke first time out,the United States,24-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This WAS working ok at first - definitely needs several passes and doesn’t get edges by about an inch - but that WAS ok-ish until it broke. Again this was the first use. It began dumping water and soap all over the floor after a loud clicking noise that changed the pitch of the machine considerably. I didn’t even get one full use out of it :(,2
Jeff Flowers,1.0 out of 5 stars,listen to bad reviews,the United States,12-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This was horrible. I believed all the great reviews and took a chance. The cap that closes the water/soap container was stuck in the unit. Water spilled everywhere. I managed to get the cap out but the machine wouldn't even vacuum up the clean water on my floor.  I tried it all over and nothing seemed to happen. I was not trying to clean up a mess but just mop the floor. It did nothing! I tried it on the carpet to see but it did not do anything there either. It smelled like mildew even though it looked new.  Stick to hand mopping, grueling as it is and get your carpets cleaned professionally",
G. Mac,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,the United States,10-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This thing is awesome!  I though I was a clean person.

My house is mostly hardwood and tile flooring. It is such a hassle to clean this monster house without hiring a maid.. I just cant bring myself to do it. So I have several robot vacuums and every cleaning device known to man (rainbow, kirby, etc). This mop is awesome and makes the job quick. The only thing I didnt like is it is kind of streaky on my wood floors. That could be a matter of changing solution. I know in my house I had to change put the dirty water and add more solution 3 times just to clean the first floor but that may not be an issue to those with less square footage.",One
Jacquelyn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk after 2 months,the United States,11-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I bought this for my friend for a Christmas present in her new home which she moved into in May she unpacked her Bissell was thrilled for two months was fanatical about keeping it clean doing everything correctly as per user instructions until it didn’t work anymore engine blew up motor won’t run slowly stopped suctioning floors and leaving muddy streaks everywhere it goes you may like it at the beginning but not worth the price as it stops working and is not repairable,
Laura O'Dell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Made Easier,the United States,19-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Great machine! Been using almost one month and no regrets. Previously used a bissel steam mop, and when it stopped working I switched to this mop. It makes cleaning the house so much easier, due to not having to vacuum first, then mop. The clean up is a slight hassle, but I still wouldn't trade it for anything else. If you rinse everything as soon as your done, it's quick. Maybe future upgrade to the self cleaning one, but really it's not that bad! You do have to pay for the solution, but a big jug should last quite some time as only a little is used. Others have complained of noise, but I don't find it alarming or anything. No louder than running a vacuum before having to mop. Will update as more time passes, but currently a great investment!",
Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works so well, I’m mortified lol 😂",the United States,21-Oct-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Granted, I’ve only used it twice but I was horrified at how much per hair it pulled up and out of my area rugs. I vacuum regularly, but this cleaner does the job of a mop, scrubber, and a vacuum on all floor surfaces. So happy with the disgusting amount of dirt/hair it picks up. Now I’m ashamed because I like to think that I’m an OCD-level clean person :0)Update: Yes, you’ll have wet globs of dirty hair in your cleaner, that’s its job. But if you rinse your cleaner in the tub, cleanup is a breeze. I recommend a hair trap or paper towels to catch hair and debris during rinsing. I don’t feel I use a lot of cleaning fluid given the amount of area I need to clean. It does the job well. LOVE this cleaner!",One
Paulina Herrmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean all parts after each use and let dry,the United States,7-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This product is AMAZING! I am a person that has always been obsessed with clean floors. I have used just about ever mop and vacuum made. I love this one because it encompasses both in one and it leaves my floors cleaner than other things.1. It sucks up the water and dirt together so you are not just swishing around dirt but actually cleaning it up.2. I use warm water and a bit of vinegar and this product works great for that.3. Make sure you take all parts that have water off after use and clean them and let them dry. I have seen things about rust on here and I am sure that’s why they rusted. It would also be like cleaning with a dirty mop if you don’t do this as the parts would be dirty for the next use if you don’t take them off and clean.4. I have seen comments that it was not sucking anything up. That is probably because they let the dirty water compartment fill up and there is no more room for more water. The tool will make a very loud sucking noise when the dirty water tank is full. You have to empty it and then it starts working again.Amazing tool!,
SandiV2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,the United States,18-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I received this a few days ago and tried it yesterday.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I like using it!  It vacuums great and the cleaning is pretty good too.  I thought my hard floors were pretty clean, but I got 2 tanks of really dirty water!!  The cleaning solution that I ordered with it left my rooms smelling really clean and nice.  Clean up of the unit takes a few minutes, but will be worth it.  I cleaned out a lot of dog hair and other debris that would clog the nozzle eventually.  Can't wait to try on my area rugs.",
Carolina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cut my cleaning time in half!,the United States,8-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This saves me lots of time! I will say if something is really stuck on the floor you’ll have to go over it a few times and use a paper towel to scrape it up. It also will not pick up pieces of cereal or larger things like that. It does pick up hair though, really well. It is a little time consuming to clean it after I use it but still saves me time because all my floors are laminate and sweeping then mopping was a horrible all day job. I will also say I have five kids and two cats the dirt and hair is real around here and this product didn’t disappoint me.",One
PC,4.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is pretty awesome. I hate mopping so this makes it ...,the United States,1-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This thing is pretty awesome. I hate mopping so this makes it less painful to keep my tile and hardwood floors clean. The only reason I deducted a star is because it won't scrub you floors like you could manually and cleaning the product is a bit of a pain. You should clean it after every use, unlike a vacuum. Plus you can't just dump it out in the sink cause there'll be hair, fuzz, and whatever else you don't want going down your drain. I find myself having to pick these things out before rinsing the container and filter out. Btw, you also have to rinse clean the rotating brush. It takes a good 5 mins to do all this. Overall, still worth it and an awesome product.",One
ELYSE,1.0 out of 5 stars,Would be fine for spills or quick clean ups,the United States,2-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Definitely not for big or tough jobs.  Would be fine for spills or quick clean ups. the tanks aren't big enough.  you have to take the brush out and clean it after each use and its not easily cleaned.  Takes too long for large areas and not tough enough for heavy traffic areas.  Not worth the money,10
DW of US,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Reliable,the United States,18-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I enjoy the bissell for what is does. My problem is that I have had two and they both started having power problems. I dont know why, but without warning when I started the machines they would run for a few seconds and just stop. I get no explanation on how to repair it. I took the first one to a vacuum service center that bissell listed and bissell sent me a new machine.  Now with the second one they had me to cut the cord and send proof of purchase , and they said they will send me the same model. My issue is why do you keep sending me the same defective model? Send me a machine that will not stop working out of the blue. I paid for the machine so why should I have to suffer through all these defects.  Bissell is very aware of the problem. They should recall the model 1785A.",One
Ryan Wayson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sucks that it doesn't suck like it should,the United States,1-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Covid kicks in, right? So I'm stuck working from home; wife is a nurse so she's still going to work. Since I'm home all day I picked up the house cleaning duties. No big deal...understandable. I'm Googling like crazy to find a 2 in 1 machine to make my life a little easier. I come across this Crosswave and think to myself, that's what I'm looking for! A vacuum and mop all in one. Checked out some reviews here on Amazon and on the YouTube. High ratings. Next best thing since pockets in pants. SOLD! Hook me up, Mr or Mrs Bissell! My right hand man got delivered to the house. Pulled that joker out of the box...I felt like the old man from Christmas Story when he pulled out the leg lamp. Ladies and gentlemen, I was ecstatic! I put it together (super easy), plugged that humdinger in and went to town with the vacuum portion. Hardwood floor, area carpets...that green and white monster ate up dirt like it hadn't been fed since it was made. I thought, ""Heck yeah! I got something here!"". Did the cleanup on it...dumped the catch thingy, rinsed out the filter and put 'er to bed. Couple days later, same thing, all good. I'm grinning ear to ear, got it sitting next to me on the front porch and telling everyone that walks by how great of a machine this thing is. Mop day comes. Now I'm thinking, if this bad mamajamma did so good on the vacuum trial, the mop trial is going to be as monumental if not...monolithic. I was right. Sprayed down some cleaning solution and it sucked it up with no issues. Couple, few vacuum/mop sessions go by and I notice some dirty water getting left behind when I'm ""mopping"". I clean the ""Green Machine"" out after every session, maybe I didn't clean it out very good that last time. I hit that thing like a proctologist looking for a pay raise. Nothing substantial came out but it did work a little better. Next mop session, a week later, the ""Green Machine"" was just puking dirty water everywhere after the first 5 minutes. Alrighty then. Stopped what I was doing and cleaned it all out again. Plugged it back in and reattempted to do that mop thing. Nope. Still tossing out dirty water. I looked at my dog and said, ""Hey girl, I think this thing is a piece of crap"". She looked back at me with those black Golden Retriever eyes as if to say, ""Yeah, dude. I agree. You did the best you could. Accept that you bought a piece of crap and toss this thing in the trash, Champ"". I reverted back to the Dyson V7 Motorhead, mop and bucket.",

Amanda Thomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Because you shouldn't have to wear shoes in your own home...,the United States,2-Oct-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Powerful cleaning. I've owned the heavier Hoover product, and comparatively, the CrossWave wins hands down. Lighter weight machine, easy to maneuver, easy to fill, easy to dump & rinse the dirty water tank. The design of this product is so much better than what we were using! Pet hair (5 dogs + 1 cat), dust bunnies, shoe traffic... the wet vacuum efficiently combines the work of 2 machines into one simple step, while taming the dust contamination that is otherwise produced by regular broom sweeping and dry-vacuuming. Less expensive than the cost of a regular cleaning service, and it's so easy, even the grumpy teens are happy to pitch in for a chance to use the ""mop machine"". Your bare feet will love the feel of clean floors beneath them. Would recommend without hesitation.",4
Renee C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Crosswave is great if you buy in store so you can return,the United States,30-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I’ve had a Bissell Crosswave previously I bought at Target and it worked great. I gave it to my daughter when it was about 1.5 years old when she got a new apartment and ordered a new one from Amazon.  The return window was open until March. At the end of June it has stopped working. It says it’s charged but won’t last forever more than about 30 seconds and the sled cleaning cycle seems to be shorted out as well.  I’ve tried different outlets and the charging light indicates it is charged bit it doesn’t have more than 30 seconds of use time.,
Mae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissel vs Hoover,the United States,15-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Say goodbye to your Hoover floormate that will soon breakdown if it hasn’t already! The bissel cleans VERY well and the suction is much better, in fact be careful because it will suck up pennies and everything else in it’s path!!!  But that doesn’t slow it down at all. My floors look lovely and I don’t anticipate it dying based on other reviews I’ve seen. I’ve lost three floormates in 2 years. Why didn’t I switch sooner???!!!! This might be more expensive up front but considering it should last much much longer it’s a money saver in the long run and cleans better including dried on crud that my Hoover with scrubbers couldn’t make a dent in!",One
S,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth Every Penny,the United States,2-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The CrossWave is everything that I wanted it to be.  Cleans my luxury vinyl planking perfectly without excreting too much water onto the floor.  Easy to fill the fresh water tank, and easy to remove and empty the dirty water tank.  Suction is unbeatable.  I vacuumed a short shag area rug with my Shark Upright before using the Crosswave to clean it.  The Crosswave pulled an additional small handful of dog hair out of the rug even after it had been vacuumed.  For hard floors, there's no need to vacuum before cleaning with the Crosswave, as long as you don't have HUGE accumulations of pet hair.  Be sure to clean pet hair from all of the bottom parts after removing your brushroll to maintain the excellent suction.  Highly recommend the CrossWave.",
Erika L,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a Good Product,the United States,31-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was excited about this - sweeping and mopping in one machine - but it’s a myth. This thing is terrible. First, ergonomically, it’s hard to steer and use (too bottom heavy and not enough control from the top) also the cord comes out of the bottom rather than the top, so you have to keep bending over to pick it up when you move spaces. The biggest problem is it doesn’t work well on animal hair AT ALL. Just spits it out the back instead so you have to walk around collecting all of those bits after just sweeping. Most disappointing is that the mopping and sweeping debris fill into the same chamber, so if you do use it for both - hoo-ee - that clean out is not fun with gunky matter. There should be two separate chambers and disposal units. I’ll go back to using separate sweeping/mopping and wait for the unicorn that finally figures out how to do this right. So long $300+ (*sigh*)",One
Julie Ann Allender,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy,the United States,22-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I can wash the floors in half the time and they come out perfectly clean. This machine is not worth the money. The floors are gritty after washing them. I even tried using a swiffer after washing them. They were still gritty. I drove to the repair place since I figured it wasn't working and was told after 2 weeks it was working fine. I guess fine is pushing dirt so the floors end up dirtier than I started. While it was at warrantee place I had to go back to my hand mop and the floors were wonderfully clean again. This time I tried again. Going over them 2-3 times which took twice as long as doing them by hand. Not worth the money.,
Jeffrey M Freeman,5.0 out of 5 stars,This unit does it all,the United States,12-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We didn't need a carpet cleaner with all the gadgets that come along with the other units.

We don't have a dirty house, but we like to keep it clean.  This guy vacuums and cleans your carpets, and for us, wide pine wood floors like a champ!  We are so happy with this cleaner - I'm glad I found it as it does our area carpets, including breaded rugs too!  OH, and it comes with a caddy for the unit and the brushes!  It's also very each to clean each part of the unit.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a powerful unit and not all the useless frills of those other expense units.",One
businesswoman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would definitely buy again,the United States,12-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,So pleased with this machine. It works great on our vinyl plank floors. Doesn’t leave streaks and I’m amazed at the dirt it pulls up with each use. The only con would be that the electric cord could be longer. It just doesn’t reach far enough and you have to unplug and go to a new outlet thus walking over your clean floor.  The carpet cleaner side is good for small spills and puppy accidents but not suitable as a deep cleaner.,

LIFE CHANGING - the absolutely cleanest my floors have ever been and so easy.,the United States,20-Jun-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My daughter told me about getting a cross-wave and raved about it.  She knows I'm a psycho about clean floors and swore I wouldn't regret it.  I've had several Bissell carpet shampooers over the years, this gave me hope.  I seriously could not believe the difference.  I live in a 600 sq foot apartment and have a vaccuum, a carpet shampooer, a steam mop, and 3 different Swiffer products.  Now I have the crosswave and I was amazed.  Can't even describe it but when I stepped on my just cleaned bathroom floor, I was stunned.  The absolutely cleanest floor I'd ever stepped on.  I see the commercials all the time.  Was never even tempted.  I'm telling you BISSELL - do a new one.  LIFE CHANGING.",

Jamie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth Every Penny!,the United States,27-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"All I have to say is WOW! I went from spending 1-2hrs washing my floors to just 20mins! I have a dog 2 boys and a messy husband. So my floors take a beating. My tile isn’t the smooth kind where you can run a mop over it for a quick clean. Because of the natural pits, I have to use a tile brush to get in the grooves, then go over it with a mop. It would take forever! Then, because the floor took forever to dry, when I had to empty the dirty water, it would leave footprints. I really HATED washing my floors.This machine is a game changer. The perfect combo of stiff bristles mixed with the soft brush, got into those grooves for a perfectly cleaned floor.  Once I went over it with the suction, the floor was dried almost instantly. Not once did I have to use my tile brush and NO FOOTPRINTS when refilling or emptying.PROS:Easy to use. No complicated parts or pieces. Just insert the handle, fill up the water tank and go! Great for the older generation who get frustrated with complicated buttons and directions.The solution lasted awhile. I have a big kitchen, so I did have to refill once. (But I only used about a 1/4 of it).Long cord, so no worries about having to stop to unplug.Brushes are easy to take out and switch.Great suction, dries floors almost immediately.CONS:The “floor” and “carpet” buttons are right next to each other, so it’s easy to hit the wrong button. (Not really a big deal).The “dirty” tank is small and fills up quick. I filled the clean tank up to the Max and had to empty the dirty 3 times. But considering how easy it is to take off, empty and replace, it wasn’t a big deal.It’s really loud. But anything with a lot of power usually is.I was hesitant to buy this. Usually if it sound too good to be true, it usually is. But This machine is worth every cent.",
BK,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great on carpet for quick clean ups too.,the United States,11-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So far so good.  Very easy to use, and take apart after cleaning.  This is a must for me otherwise I will not use it.  I am not using the cleaner - I read the reviews about making your own, which I prefer  (vinegar).  I have cats and who wants that on their paws?  I used a very mild soap when trying the carpet cleaner.  I spilled coffee and thought I would try and see what the carpet brush would do on my very low pile carpet.  Went over it about 10 times (3 foot area) and it looks clean.  I have pets and sometimes they have accidents - so I purchased a rug cleaner too and I'm thinking I wont need it now.  Have to wait and see until after the rug dries completely.  If it works, its saving me time and money.  Now on to the floors.  I will update after I use it on them - but so far so good.",One
Kristen Lyles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,the United States,4-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"* The picture of the dirty water was taken before I even used it on my rugs! *Summary - it takes great place of a mop, it’s possible to be used instead of vacuuming and sweeping but definitely doesn’t do great dry.I always sweep vacuum and mop but my floors ALWAYS feel dirty, they feel so clean now! I’m still learning how far I can take this vacuum, I still swept a little and vacuumed the mud off the entry rug before using this one. I suppose this would work just fine for everything but it doesn’t work well dry. And for tough or heavy mud you would want to rinse and clean the brush before using through the rest of the house.",

So out the door went my bucket and mop.  After I was finished the floors had a brightness to them.  If anyone is wondering if it cleans ground in dirt, it will take it up.

Strong suction on the rugs.I run a dog sitting business so hair is always an issue.  It cleaned it up on both surfaces.And I was pleased at how easy it was to clean.

Darla B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beats a mop!!!,the United States,17-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for a wet/dry commercial grade floor cleaner.  While not commercial grade, this item does what it advertises at a fraction of a commercial floor machine.  I would spend nearly half a day vacuuming and then mopping a whole house of hard wood floors, this did all of that in less than an hour.  And like similar posts, mopping just pushes dirt around, so when I noticed this would happen with a mop I had to clean soak the mop EVERY couple swipes just to really deep clean.  This does it all in one pass.  It is a bid loud, but not much more than a vacuum.  With 4 dogs, hair and tracks require daily maintenance, this thing has made my life so much easier.  I will take this to our new house with 100% tile, whoever invented this....THANK YOU!",
Glen Thomasson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Product is very frustrating.  I do not recommend.,the United States,18-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have been very disappointed in this product.  I will be seeing if I can still return it.  It does not suck up fibers or just general messes from the kids (think dried plado). As you use the mopping function the ability to pick up dirt only gets worse.  The vacuum just pushes debri across the floor and rolls fibers into balls and then spits them back out.....and they are wet which is just gross.  I don’t see how this could pick up animal fur if it can’t handle carpet fibers.  In addition, the chord is so short that I have to move the plug sometimes within a room and definitely will not reach additional rooms without moving the plug.  Further the chord comes out at the bottom of the vacuum so I am constantly tripping over it.  I expected much from the vacuum especially with the added work of having to clean the vacuum after each use.  I do not reccomend this product.",
Barbara Stiver,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never clean your floors with the same dirty water again!,the United States,9-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"With three boys running a muck, this is an absolute life saver! From accidental spills, tracked in mud from their hard at play shoes, to the food that missed their mouths and collected underneath the dinner table. This is the answer to all your mom-ing needs! Often we dread the everyday need to sweep and mop our floors, with the bissell crosswave your sometimes multiple need to sweep and mop daily, becomes your less stressed part of keeping up with those busy little bodys with the convenience of your mop and broom all in one. Never clean your floors with the same dirty water again! The bissell uses clean water and solution for every inch, never leaving those dirty streak marks again. I highly recommend splurging on this product, for the over all time and effort this saves you in a day, let's you worry less about the little things leaving you more time to create memories with out the interruption of an accidental mess. I promise you, you will not regret this much needed addition to your family. With the extreme amount of power within it's suction and rotation of he cleaning brush, if used on a crack or tear in laminate floor. Be sure to only go across that area moving forward and not backwards, this can result in an unfortunate removal of that piece of the flooring.

The roller doesn't have hair in it, it seems to be a product malfunction maybe in the design. Too bad because when it does work I love it. Love it really. Design quality is a problem.",2
Ashley Rose,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for pet hair,the United States,19-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Not great for houses with a lot of animal hair. The suction was great when doing a dry vacuum, but as soon as you do anything with the cleaning function, hair clogs the area where the cleaning solution dispenses and it doesn’t dispense evenly in the roller brush, and the dirty water can’t get back into the container. It’s just a dirty watery mess. Had high hopes, but it just isn’t designed well for animal hair in any capacity.",2
Saving lives,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps reduce mop time,the United States,19-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love that I can vacuum and mop my hardwood and vinyl at the same time. Really reduces the amount of time I spend cleaning the floors. I would recommend getting the pet one if you have animals that shed. We only have one small dog that sheds and it fills up with hair. A little difficult to clean it out of the cracks and crannies of the canister. The filter in the pet one would definitely be more convenient.,
Angie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for clean freaks!! Buy it!!,the United States,20-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I absolutely loved the results! It was so easy to go from tile to wood to rug and my floors look amazing. No streaks! I’m very picky about cleaning products and I have no complaints about this! It leaves a very pleasant light clean scent in the house too. Make sure you buy the cleaning solution because it doesn’t come with a bottle. It was easy to clean and the only thing I had to be mindful of was dumping the dirty water out and adding more water/solution as it emptied. The machine will let you know when the dirty water is full and that’s also when you’ll need to add more solution. Highly recommend! I’ll never be using a regular mop again.,
Holly,4.0 out of 5 stars,2 in 1 get it done,the United States,18-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Does what it says it does. Not as light weight as I thought it would be, but overall it's the best cleaning machine I have ever purchased. Saves me so much time being able to vacuum and mop in one shot, and it really does pick up almost anything, I feel like my floors have never been cleaner and having the extra supplies that come with this package was a very nice extra bonus.  Don't forget to clean your filter every few uses. Also, after using all the solution that comes with it,  I went back to my other cleaning solution (pinesol).",
alyssa,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype!,the United States,19-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I thought this product sucked. I purchased it on a deal for $219.99. I was so excited to try it out. First, it’s not any faster than sweeping and mopping. The vacuum sucks and it doesn’t even really vacuum bigger pieces off the floor. I have a knockoff stick vacuum that does a better job. It doesn’t get the floor that clean with stuck on food or spills from kids. It is honestly way faster and quieter to vacuum or sweep then mop. It’s not worth the hype! Returned it!",

I used the red bristled brush (bought separately), with no solution in the tank to just vacuum. It done WONDERFULLY! Then I added solution and a different brush and cleaned the rest of the house. No complaints from me. I do want to say the base is smaller than I imagined, but I would definitely buy it again!",One
Leigh ,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you hate to mop...,the United States,11-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If you hate to mop so much that you don’t mind taking the machine apart and cleaning it every time you use it, this is for you. It’s really handy to be able to vacuum (it has fairly good suction) and mop at the same time. But because it is wet and dirty after use, you will need to take it apart each time, rinse it, and let it thoroughly dry before reassembling so it won’t smell or mildew. It’s not that bad to do, and totally worth it if you hate mopping. Great if you have pets who shed and track in dirt.",

Anonymous FL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell's Crosswave Works as Described and MUCH Better than Hoover's Floormate,the United States,2-Sep-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"In June 2019, I bought Bissell's Crosswave, hard-floor and area-rug cleaner. In early September 2019 I, first, used my Bissell Crosswave on my kitchen and bathroom tile floors.The Bissell is lighter, easier to maneuver, operate, and maintain than Hoover's Floormate.The Bissell also cleans my tile floors better than the Hoover, ever did!  The Bissell vacuumed up the residue water better, too.I only have real tile and real wood flooring; therefore, I cannot speak about area rugs, as I don't have any.I've a right to make the comparison between products, as previously I owned two Hoover Floormates. The last one didn't work at all.",

I couldn’t believe how dirty the water was and love the ease in operating this lightweight cleaner.Worked great on my hardwood without streaking or leaving too much wetness behind. Made my tile floor shine without having to get on my hand and knees to scrub. And it’s true - I didn’t need to get out a vacuum first and then a mop. This is definitely All in one!,
Carolyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,So impressed!!,the United States,28-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this crosswave a while ago, but only recently used it.  I was so impressed!  This is an appliance that lives up to the hype and then some!  It does exactly what it says it will do.  It even removed sticky, stuck on gunk.  I had to go over it several times, but it worked!  This is an amazing vacuum and every house should have one.  So impressed...did I say impressed enough?  It really is that amazing!",

I bought a new house the the previous owner seem to not care about cleaning their floors. It was nasty and the water was black. Yes every wet mop vacuum requires cleaning.

Adam L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well on hardwoods!,the United States,30-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This machine prevented me from buying separate machines for hardwoods/tile and area rugs.  I think it did a fantastic job on the hard floors.  It was less capable on an area rug.  Truth be told, my dog had picked the rug as his favorite spot in the world so I wasn't expecting it to come out spotless.  I with is had come with an attachment for upholstery.  That would have been an excellent add-on.",One
Beverly Joan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked wonderfully ONCE!!,the United States,16-Nov-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The second time I was going to use the Cross Wave, it wouldn't start.  We took it to 3 vacuum repair shops and we're told it was no use - they couldn't fix it.  The third repair shop finally told us to just through it away.  That's what the gentleman did.  Since it was thrown away, Bissell Cross Wave would not even give me a partial refund, or any other solution.  I am currently out the price of the Cross Wave purchased through Amazon. I would never recommend this to any other customer!!",3
Weiying Zhang,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, powerful, and effective",the United States,8-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"In old days, I would do whole house thorough cleaning 6 months. Now, I can do it my own with this lightweight and powerful machine almost every month. I just enjoyed playing the machine :-).The vacuum is very powerful, and the mopping effect is strong! This machine allows me to do vacuum and mopping together and saves my efforts.I only have one product improvement recommendation: when water tank is low, the sucking sound changes and I know I need to add water, which is fine. But, if the round is the last round, then the left water is not usable. So, I suggest to improve the water tank shape so that the left water is minimal to pull out if at the last round.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT PURCHASE.,the United States,14-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS! Mine quit working after 1 month. I contacting amazon for assistance and they sent me to BISSELL for assistance. Bissell told me that I could not have a refund or a new machine sent to me. Waste of money. I will never purchase another Bissell product due to the fact that they do not give refunds or send a replacement for a broken machine.,3
AZ shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really does a good job & is easy to use,the United States,1-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I gave away my big heavy FloorMate after using this several times on my tile floors. Somebody really did some great designing with this one.It is light, swivels, & has a long enough cord to clean kitchen & living room without relocating the plug,. It stands up by itself too.The multi surface mop head has soft and stiff brush parts which can clean textured tiles. Cleaning the machine after using is important, but easy. The plastic floor stand keeps leaks from redirtying your floor when your put it away. I used to use the wet stiffer more often, but now I don’t put off really cleaning the kitchen floor. It’s so easy to get the Bissell out & get it really clean.",One
SandyFans,5.0 out of 5 stars,This machine really works and quickly too.,the United States,8-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just now used this to clean about 650 sq ft of hardwood flooring. I was dubious about its ability to clean until I took the waste tank outside to dump the waste water…Wow! I had to use a garden hose to flush out about 1 inch of solid gunk!Yes, this machine really works. It is saving me hours of manual scrubbing, wiping, vacuuming, and repeating.  This is a real labor & time saver.",
Renea Y.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best investment ever!,the United States,1-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"First let me start by saying I am very hard to impress. Secondly, Bissell got this hard floor cleaner right. I've bought a few in the past and this is the first one I haven't considered sending back.The product is worth the investment, I have used the swiffer product in the past which is expensive because you're constantly buying pads and solution. The Bissell Crosswave uses warm water in the reservoir The best part is you get to see the clean up happen before your eyes. There is a separate dirty water receptacle. The crosswave operates exactly as described it cleans and dries the floor in the same action.Biggest drawback: having to hold the solution dispense button for a few seconds...really. Also, occasionally I see a trail of water in the floor, nut I just make another pass with the crosswave and it's gone. In case your wondering why I only gave 4 stars, because there is always room for improvement. But with this one you can throw out the old mop and bucket for sure.",2
Adonna Niosi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Useful but takes work,the United States,1-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This needs thoroughly cleaned and washed after each use no matter how small or it will smell super gross the next time you use it. So don’t expect to use it and put it away. Otherwise, it cleans floors nicely. My tiles look great after using. Although, you also must go over large spots several times to remove. Plus, I thought it would vacuum alone without the water if I wanted to do a rug. Nope.But all in all, for the price it’s ok for now.",
Rea L. Name,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its okay but too small,the United States,6-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I like the idea here. If you have a generally easy to clean floor and a small area this will be fine. But it just doesn't have the power for bigger jobs. The reservoirs are just too small and the brush is not wide enough. it does the job and it's better than nothing but I would have been better off spending twice the money for a professional unit. However I didn't realize that was an option before buying this thing. Lesson learned!,
CJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny,the United States,13-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Best. Cleaner. Ever! I waited over a year to review the Bissell Crosswave because I’ve been through so many other cleaners that broke down after about 6-9 months. The Crosswave exceeded all my expectations regarding ease of use and getting the job done quickly to my high standards. Our entire home is tiled, we have 2 small dogs (one that after 6 yrs still has the occasional indoor potty accident), a bird, and frequent visitors - a lot of traffic. As a stickler for cleanliness, the Crosswave has made my life so much easier in keeping my floors and grout lines pristine.",One
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Be aware, third replacement after first two went off in smoke",the United States,24-Nov-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Definitely do not recommend this machine. This is the third time within the past 1.5 this needed to be replaced because this machine can't even handle just regular once a week use without going off in smoke.

Dana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Small Vacuum,the United States,23-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was tired of having to carry my Dyson upstairs every time I had to vacuum.  I used one of these at my friend's ski house this year and knew I had to have one!  It's super light, but the suction power is amazing!  Carpets, tile or hard wood, it does a great job.  My Dyson doesn't work as well as this vacuum and I haven't used it since.  The vacuum is inexpensive, so it wouldn't bother me one bit if it doesn't last a long time, I would just buy another!!!",
deb m.,2.0 out of 5 stars,This is not the same Crosswave as the one I bought before that looks just like it.,the United States,30-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I had one of these previously - it looked exactly like it and STEAMED/VACUUMED.  My cleaners borrowed it for another client and destroyed it/burnt out the motor.  When I ordered this one as a replacement I found that it does not steam like the other one.  Now I'm stuck with it and am p/o'd about it --- maybe my own fault because I didn't notice that the functions of the Crosswave have been changed - but in my estimation the company should highlight when a model is modified to remove functions.,
Judith McClellan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Team Bissell!!!!,the United States,29-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,So worth the money!!!I first bought a tinco because “it was cheaper and better” that’s not the case with me the tinco was horrible!! You literally get what you paid for!This is just amazing the suction the brushes and the water tank! I haven’t tried it on my carpet yetWish I would have just bought this first!So easy to cleanup and put away compared to the tinco!!!,
Matt,2.0 out of 5 stars,Choose something else,the United States,17-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Hard floors (synthetic hardwood): dry suction works ok, about as good as any other vacuum.Wet function: works ok, haven't had much of an opportunity to clean up stains or big spills yet.Carpet: dry suction again works ok, nothing really special. I've had battery ones perform better.Wet function: very poor performance on carpet. I dry vacuum first then try to use the wet and I can't cover an area larger than 2'x2' without having to stop and clear the clog that builds up after the brush or no hair/dirt makes it into the bin. This gets old when you're trying to do your whole apartment/house.Prepare to clean this thing a lot. Aside from the previously mentioned clogs, hair/dirt gets into every part and you have to disassemble and clean it all after each use. I expected to wash out the brush and the bin but it's more than I anticipated.To clarify, I live alone with 1 dog with medium/short fur who I brush weekly and who doesn't shed much and I also have short hair. I use the dry vac every other day and the wet vac every 3rd day and still get these clogs with every wet vac use. The carpet is short but not flat like in an office building.In summary, I think you can find something better for the price or pay a little more and get something higher quality.",One
Kristen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for really gross families,the United States,22-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have two large dogs (one of which sheds like nothing I have ever seen), a preschooler, a husband who resembles Pigpen from the Peanuts cartoon, and live in a muddy area. My steam mop was no longer cutting it even before it broke, and in the weeks it tool me to settle on this as a replacement....well, my floors could only be described as a disgrace. It did take a couple of go-overs with this to take care of the extreme filth that had built up. You do need to sweep before you run it to get up the big stuff, or if you have an excessive amount of pet hair. But LIGHTYEARS better than anything else I have tried. I feel quite confident that now that things are back to a normal level of mess, this will be able to keep things in check",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good!",the United States,27-Nov-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have only used the Crosswave once as I just received it today.  I plan to use it solely for my hardwood floors.  I was very impressed with how clean my floors were afterwards and how much dirt came from the floors and I clean my floors often.  I do not have pets just heavy foot traffic in my house.It was extremely easy to put together.  Took me less then five minutes to assemble.  To vacuum and wash my hardwood floors to get a thorough cleaning takes me hours.  It literally took me about 15 minutes to vacuum/ wash approximately 1200 sq ft.  It was very easy to maneuver and it did not leave the floors very wet. The floors dried within a few minutes and despite what other people have said I did not see any streaks and I have dark wood.I can not comment on the durability however I like that it has a two year warranty.  I have owned other Bissell products including a heavy duty carpet cleaner that I just recently got rid of after 5+ years.  I blame part of the malfunction on the fact I didn't clean it the way it was instructed but plan to clean this cleaner after every use. I did not find it that time consuming to wash the parts and let them air dry.  Took me less then five minutes to rinse everything out.  I'll take that over washing my floors for hours.I would never use this cleaner as I have seen demonstrated on YouTube such as cleaning up milk with cereal or anything like that because I would fear it would begin to gunk up and clog the machine.  I find it unnecessary anyway. I would use a paper towel to pick up the food and then clean the floors with the cleaner.  I think for what I intend to use it for it works great.  Hopefully it lasts just like my other Bissell products!!,
Jenny,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love that I can vaccuum and wash floor at same time,the United States,23-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I like the suction power, ease of attachments and cleaning up after.  I was surprised at how much dirt and dog hair there actually is !!!!  It is a bit LOUD when operating.  The foam/soap will build up if you don't move back and forth.  Also the rubber wheels sometimes leave a scuff mark but that is easily rubbed out.  Overall for the cost and convenience I am happy with this machine.",One
Breña,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really dissappointed,the United States,27-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"For as much money as this costed I really expected better than this. The suction power is minimal, it leaves streaks on both hardwood/tile and carpet/rugs. It’s hard to roll and I have to to over the same area repeatedly to get everything. It doesn’t pick up big debris. Just really not worth the money. I think you’re really just paying for the Brand name at this point.",
Cali Girl  ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Want clean floors? This is your tool!!,the United States,30-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love love love my Bissell Crosswave, and bought one as a gift for my parents too. Nothing beats the cleaning power and the satisfaction of seeing dirt peeled off the floors. I’ve tested my floors by taking a wet napkin and trying to wipe the floor after washing them , and to my amazement, no dirt gets on the napkin because floors are super clean. Highly recommended for homes with kids or pets. I have young kids who run around barefoot and their feet used to be dirty when I used my shark floor cleaner even after washing the floors. That problem is gone with the Bissell.",
happygolky,5.0 out of 5 stars,I typically like to use things for a while before I write ...,the United States,6-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this product about 5 months ago. I typically like to use things for a while before I write a review. First the product came on time and as described, no damage, no issues. I bought the this cleaner because I have 2 and at the time had a guest 3rd dog and it is impossible to have clean floors for long with pets. I have both wood and tile flooring in the main living and kitchen areas. Personally I think the best way to clean a floor is with a good rug, bucket on hands and knees, however since I sometimes need to clean my floors twice a day, that method would not be possible.I first began using the product after I had already swept and mopped the floors, to give it an extra finish. After doing that for about 4 weeks, I decided to just give Bissell CrossWave a try without first vacuuming or sweeping floor (no large pieces of junk on floor). Well to my surprise the result was just as good as with my first method, and 5 times faster. It has great suction and picks up every small particle. I first used plain water and vinegar, then tried water and liquid castle soap, then the recommended bissell solution. I got best results with liquid castle soap and the bissell solution. Good results with water and vinegar, if i mop the floor first with well diluted cleaning agent.So 5 months later, I couldn't be happier.Also, I have not tried it on rugs. Will update when I do.",10

Richa,1.0 out of 5 stars,Total disappointment !!!,the United States,7-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"There are so many flaws with their technology, totally endless. The wire position is so low, it keeps coming your way while in use,  the water tank concept , the brush..they collect lot of dust in liquid form...total nightmare to clean. Its heavy , plus cannot go below furniture etc. not great on rugs,  whats the point if i have to use 2 vacuums - one for hard wood and one for rugs. Overall very poor tech. No wonder it’s not famous and didn’t stand in front of dyson and shark.",
Jdls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price,the United States,2-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is a great purchase. It’s worth the high price tag.

Laura E. Oberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must for everyone who has floors,the United States,20-Aug-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this machine.  I was a little nervous when I read about the cleanup but I find that as long as you have leak proof trash bags you can even use this in a apartment.  At my home it was easy I had a composter which is where it was dumped cat hair and all.  The only issue is it does not do corners very well but I no longer need to sweep or vacuum and then mop.  This has saved me hours in my old house.  I had to move to an apartment due to an electrical fire in my home and I bought this machine again on prime day.  I would recommend this to anyone who has floors.  Does a pretty good job on carpets too.  LOVE THIS MACHINE,One

I had struggled so much with my floors, we have 4 young kids, 2 German shepherds who shed constantly, and 2 cats who also shed. Regardless of how often I would vacuum and mop my wood floors they ALWAYS looked like they had smudges and just didn't look clean. Now that I have the Bissell CrossWave it's completely night and day. I thought I just had horrible floors put in and needed to get new flooring but now I love my floors. It's simple and easy to use, very easy to clean. If you've been struggling with keeping your floors clean, or just want to cut out the two-step process of sweeping then mopping then definitely get this!",One
Christine O'Rourke,4.0 out of 5 stars,Two Kids Under 5… it’s MAGIC,the United States,2-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Completely honest review…. Couldn’t wait to get the kids in bed so I could inbox the thing! Disclaimer: I did vacuum before I used the cross wave (just in case). I have two boys under five and needless to say… my floors get GROSS! I don’t have pets, but the boys are enough to keep the floors icky. Anyway, I’m really impressed with how well this worked. I was really skeptical at first, and really the only reason I picked 4 stars is because towards the end it made this weird low pitch noise (almost like a sock was stuck in it even though it wasn’t). Other than that- the results are great! I can’t wait until it’s time again to use it! BUY IT, Y’ALL! 😍",
Allison Sandman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Floor Cleaner EVER,the United States,14-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So, our business (cattle feeding) put the CrossWave to the utmost test.  We have 4 employees and lots of mud, manure, and dirt!  I’ve been at my wits end about the best way to clean our tile floors and grout.  I worked for 2 hours tonight to get these spotless.  I was very impressed with the brush and the cleaner working together to remove these stubborn stuck on substances!  I was very pleased with the result of the CrossWave!  I used 3 clean water containers with solution and empties 6-7 times pure mud!!  What I appreciate most about this machine is the ease of removing the brush for cleaning and the dirty water container and filter.  The only downfall is that it doesn’t clean right to the edge of the tile next to walls.  I decided I can live with that....look at the before and after photos!!",
zman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised-ish,the United States,27-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"For the most part, it works as advertised.  Two things:Wish the suction had a little more power. When using it on short rugs the recovery tank is only a fraction of the amount of liquid used.To set it upright, you have to ""snap"" it into place.  I can see that part being a weak spot and breaking sooner rather than later.Another factor I didn't consider is you have to clean the whole thing after use meaning sucking in clean water to clean the inner hoses, rinsing out the recovery bin, washing the roller and cover.  They make it easy by having everything snap apart, but it's still a bit of a chore.Overall I am happy with the unit, but will probably only use it every other cleaning cycle.",
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,It is a really nice product.

AB,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good. Some improvements would make it great!,the United States,21-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is our first wet/dry vacuum. Family of 3 with a dog and a backyard. We've had it for a couple weeks so far.Pros:- Good cleaning power. This machine cleans the floor much better than we expected. We mostly rely on it to mop our tile floor (Florida)- Easy to use- Light weight- Interchangeable brushes based on surface typePotential improvements that would make this product awesome:- Offering a battery powered version. This would be fantastic if feasible.- Limit passive drain if water tank is not empty. It leaks if you leave it standing with some water left in the clean tank- Headlights. I find headlights on vacuums very handy. They help you locate water puddles or dirt that you can't see with regular room lighting. The current headlight is only on when you're actively dispensing cleaner.- Retractable cord for the electric powered unitsOverall:We love this machine and we highly recommend it. Our floors are cleaner than before with less overall effort spent. Highly recommended.,
Gymgearaddict,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells awful,the United States,23-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Vacuum works well for first 2 weeks. Then it takes a few times over to clean anything and hair just sticks to wet floor. Also learned a huge lesson that if you don't empty the reservoir immediately after it reeks of a dead animal. Cleaned it out soap and chemicals and still smells bad when I use it. Area rug feature is hard to push Vacuum over anything other than wood floor. Corners and hard to reach areas impossible because there is no hose.,One
Jazwyn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does A Lousy Job,the United States,6-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was really looking forward to using this Crosswave after reading many reviews from various websites.  I purchased it in January and have to say that I am EXTREMELY disappointed.  Even after going over a particular area of my laminate tile floor many times then letting it dry, the floor still doesn't look clean and shows every footstep after being ""cleaned"".  Lousy job.I would not recommend this product.",
TonyW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great as a low-pile rug cleaner!,the United States,24-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I actually use the Crosswave on my low-pile wall-to-wall carpet and area rugs.  It cleans them great and has a wonderful smell!  I have used it monthly for two years and it still works great (I have a dog).  You must clean it completely after each use to keep it in perfect order but it is easy to do.  Have not had to hire a carpet cleaning service since I bought this!!Paid for itself many times over.,One
Kimberly Newcomer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Its good just for a single/couple home.  If you have pets or kids do not buy. It can't handle it.,the United States,12-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Im actually disappointed. The reviews were really good for this product so I was just so excited but it didn't suck well nor does it clean well. Ughhhh. I just need something that works.I have 5 dogs total. 3 are puppies. I have concrete floors. Not putting down expensive floors now with young pups. But I do want clean floors and (throwing a fit here) just want it to clean. Ughhh.....disappointed.,
Carrie Walton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,29-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Love this product!  So much better than dragging out the mop and bucket and having to wring out a mop. I use it every night to clean my white tile kitchen floor in just a few minutes.  The rest of our floors are tiled and I missed the ease of just vacuuming the bedroom carpets as sweeping never seems to pick up all the dirt and it’s a lot of trouble to carry the mop/bucket throughout the house. Thanks to this product I can easily clean the bedroom floors! My only complaint is that the brush cover can be hard to remove and the mop tips over easily if it’s not locked in the upright position well.  But I still give it a 5 star rating!,
Toni M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,26-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this product to clean our screened in lanai. The floor is tile and gets very dirty as you can imagine. After reading many reviews about this product I was very hesitant to purchase it. The biggest complaint I heard was that it makes a mess and does not pick up water/or sprays dirty water all over the place. I found this to be true when the tank was full. It does need to be emptied in order to pick up more water which makes sense. I was able to clean the whole lanai floor as well as an area rug and was very pleased with the results. It does exactly what I purchased it to do, is super easy to clean, and I would definitely recommend this product. The only negatives I encountered were that it gets within 1 inch of the wall, but no closer. The roller just does not allow for it. Additionally, I needed to further clean some of the grout where some  tough dirt stayed. But I would not have expected a machine to clean this anyways. I did try it on my bamboo wood floors, and was mostly pleased however I don’t like to see any streaks, and there were s few areas this happened. Over all I give this product 5 stars.",
Meika,5.0 out of 5 stars,One stop cleaning machine,the United States,30-Nov-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So far I really like this vacuum. It goes from my tile kitchen floor to my hardwood floors to the fine area rug with easy. It has great suction and uses less water than I thought.I only wish the spinning rod was interchangeable with a scrub brush feature. The rod it comes with is cloth and doesn’t do well with any stain that needs a little elbow grease.Pros: light weight, one step sweep and mop, easy assembly, easy to refill and empty, can use your own cleaning product, self cleaning feature (haven’t tried yet)Cons: loud, soft fabric rod (needs a hard brush to scrub tile)I’ve only used it twice so I will update if needed.",
Rachle71,5.0 out of 5 stars,DEFINITELY WORTH PURCHASING!,the United States,7-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So far this little mqchine has been AMAZING! I have all hardwood floors in our house and this has made it so much easier to keep them clean. The water tank is easily filled, the dirty tank is easy to clean and the roller was simple to remove and clean. Very happy with this purchase!",2
Hima,1.0 out of 5 stars,Please dont waste your money like I did,the United States,9-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Worst vaccume cleaner. Waste of time and money. I had an old bissell that was much cheaper and had very good suction power. This one however I have a very bad experience with very minimal suction, worst to clean at corners and stairs.Very noisey with a very small dirt collector.I don't even want to tell about wet vaccuming as it is very basic as well. I some times had a black spots on my white carpet(main reason why I went to this vaccume cleaner).I wasted a lot of money and energy calling their customer service guys, good experience with their customer service. I got a replacement with my complaints but I ended up hating that as well as it is the same product.I just want to get my money back but I m not in return window anymore.😔😩😣😖🤢😥😢😪",
Olga B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh.,the United States,5-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"ON HARD FLOORS: it doesn't scrub very well, no matter how long u position it over the stain. And u can't physically apply more pressure as with regular mops. So it's good for prompt pick-ups, but if that jelly dried out - forget about.ON CARPET: It's good, but it doesn't have the locomotion, as in regular vacuums (u know when u switch it to carpet mood, and it goes zoooom). So YOU have to do all the pushing. Good exercise I guess, if u r into that.",2
Sharon Hecker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works even better than I expected!,the United States,21-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've been using this for a week now in my condo in  Florida. Every floor here is tile. Before I came here I had a cleaning crew come and clean, so I thought the floors looked clean. But when I used the Crosswave, I was horrified at how black and dirty the water was that I poured away! My floors are SO clean and I love this. I have porcelain tile in my bedroom and it gave it a mirror shine. For once, something that I've seen on infomercials and QVC works exactly like they say it does. Easy to put together and to use, easy to clean up the floors and easy to clean the roller, I can't ask for more. When I go back to NJ I'm getting one to use on my laminate floors.",One
Audrey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works amazing.,the United States,17-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars is because it does NOT come with a hair catcher in the tank. You do have to purchase it separately which isn’t a big deal but I do feel this product should come with it. It’s gross dumping the tank and then having to put your hand in there to scoop out the hair and bits of whatever was sucked up. It has amazing suction power and works great on my floors. I will never go back to a regular vacuum and mop again!,
Nana Tonya  Hunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Every house hold should have one.,the United States,17-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I used my Daughter's and was amazed how easy it was to push and the suction was great.It was not until I bought this one that I fell more in love with this product. I have one long haired Dashchund and when I used it to vaccumm It brought ip enough hair it could have been a small puppy.. I keep a clean house, NOW I am confident beyond belief my floor is really clean. The ability to shampoo or vac mop is amazing..",
margaret,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic machine!,the United States,13-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I researched the Crosswave for a few months and I decided to buy it because I just moved to South Carolina and I have all wood floors except the bedrooms. I also have 3 bathrooms 2 of them have tile floors and 1 with the wood floors. The house is 3000 square feet and most of it is not carpeted. I absolutely love this crosswave! I used the multi purpose cleaner it came with my floors came out beautiful! So shiny clean and the best thing you don’t have to sweep the floors first it does it all. We had a real Christmas tree and it took care of whatever needles that where left that we didn’t get up! I also cleaned the throw rug in my Carolina room after my grandchildren left it looks great! Cleaning it was very simple and easy just follow the instructions in the booklet. I have told all my friends and family about it and told them they must get it!,
Julia V,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely not worth the money or hassle of using it!,the United States,20-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I used it for a vinyl tile flooring.  I have a large kitchen, hallway, bathroom and laundry room.  The head of the machine is small so it took FOREVER to get through cleaning the kitchen.  I gave up on doing the other areas.  The machine holds a very small amount of fluid even filling to the large area level.  The spray comes out uneven with dry and wet areas so I had to go back and forth at an angle to wet the wash area.  The sucking power was good but I also had to go back over the wet area three or four times at an angle to get the wash fluid vacumed up.  I returned it and got my money back.  I do not recommend this machine.",2
Crystal,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good in theory but disappointed,the United States,31-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I've given this unit 7 months of trial. I run a small home daycare and thought this would help me with quick tidying after meal times instead of sweeping then mopping. No matter how much I clean this thing it always reeks of mildew. I clean constantly but alas it always just had this awful smell.,2
Linda Bauer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for textured tile floors!,the United States,18-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have both tile and hardwood floors. Found that this machine works best on tile which is great because thats what i purchased it for. “Keeps”my textured tile and grout clean (if its not extremely dirty to start with) unlike a swifter mop which leaves dirty water in the grout lines. It does take a little maintenance to keep it clean and working properly but better than scrubbing grout!  I love it and so do my housekeepers! If you use the carpet setting it puts more water down and works better in my opinion.,
John Seaton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy this machine if you have hardwood floors!,the United States,30-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My only regret with this purchase is that I didn’t do it years earlier. I had been using a Bona microfiber mop for the past fifteen years. When I would wipe up water on the kitchen floor with a white paper towel, I would be appalled at how dirty the towel was, even if the floor had been mopped the day before.If you look at the grey cleaning solution the Bissell Crosswave picked up it looked like mixed concrete. Using the Bona microfiber mop or any other similar system makes a slurry out of the dirt and it ends up in the inevitable gaps between the hardwood boards or the grout lines in a tile floor. The Bissell solution dissolves the buildup and the machine has strong suction that removes the filth from the grout and wood cracks and wood grain leaving a truly clean floor.",
Erik V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Changer!,the United States,18-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is everything everyone says! It's awesome, buy it! I can't believe I waited this long! It makes cleaning sooooo much easier. We have 90% tile in our house and this makes it soo easy to clean AND CLEAN BETTER THAN BEFORE!! Floors come out great and the bissell cleaner smells great. Also used it on an area rug that we hadn't deep cleaned in YEARS and it came out awesome! I can't recommend it enough! If I had one gripe, it's that I wish the cord was longer... But that's it, nothing else I would change! Kudos to bissell for making this.",One
Roger Smith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fell below expectations,the United States,20-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Used on my hard wood floors.  Two issues, first was even after using required amount of included cleaner it made the floors tacky (sticky) when walked on.  Second issue was it did not appear to suck up all the water.  Once floors dried they had a scum look.  Had to use an entire box of Swiffer to remove one room and a hallway.  Would definitely not recommend this product to anyone!",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"large amounts of hair, the only issue",the United States,26-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"this wet/dry does exactly what it says it will. your passes could be wider. but if you go slow enough, youll do a single pass. running parallel along your baseboards will leave a 1/2"" gap of untouched floor. but youll be surprised how long the reservoir will last. be aware that youll need to dump the catch container pretty often if you want to maintain peak suction.only critiques:1 - wish the cord came out closer to the handle2 - would like edge to edge cleaning power for running along the floors edge3 - wider berth of cleaning per passbottom line: I love what it does, can overlook what it doesnt",
PEP,5.0 out of 5 stars,So easy.  Should have purchased sooner!,the United States,19-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a two year old and he tosses everything, especially his juice cups.  Mopping used to be a major pain.  This is so easy and does a much better job than a regular mop that just pushes the dirt around.  My floors are clean.  No sticky residue.  Dries fast.  So easy.  Great value too.  Comes with an extra multi surface roller and a sample of Bissell’s multi surface cleaner.",
Sarah Beck,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,the United States,4-Nov-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have 3 dogs, one of which sheds enough for 3 more - this vacuum is AMAZING. Gets not only ALL of the hair but saves me SO MUCH time by mopping all at once. I can get my whole 2,200+ sq ft house cleaned and check that off my to do list in 30 min where it used to not only take me an hour to get it all done, but I spent so much extra money on swiffer pads and cleaning product Im saving both time and money - I love it!

Phoenix AZ RN,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best of All,the United States,2-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Excellent clean and easy to use and to clean the machine afterward. Even shampoos area rugs.

I have to clean the brush and bottom of it 1/2 way through my 1800 sq ft home and it sometimes leaves streaks if extra dirty floors. You can use the Bissell floor solution or others.

Amanda Danielle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best tool for my busy household,the United States,2-Feb-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This thing is a dream- the vaccum works great with the mop at the same time. I have used it on area rugs and it gets out minor stains. I have used all of the different cleaners- they leave the floor smooth- not shiny and not slippery. It does not give you that gummy feeling that a swiffer does. Get rid of that steam mop- mop bucket- whatever tool you are using to smear dirt around and get this thing! It has been a life saver.DO follow the directions and take it apart each time you use it- its so easy. But if you dont- you get that musty smell like an old dish rag from it not being able to dry naturally. I stick mine in the sun as directed and it dries overnight!,One
James S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It,the United States,18-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I got this to clean my laminate flooring. I also ordered the wood flooring cleaning solution and the wood flooring roller brush.  Before I began I got a big towel handy as I was sure I was going to need to clean up the excess cleaner...Wrong!! The Crossware's vacuuming was so efficient there was no need to wipe the floor afterwards at all. I noticed no streaking as some mentioned. The floors looked great afterwards. It is amazing how dirty a floor that looks clean can actually be. Clean up was no big deal either.  I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it.,One
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,This doesn’t not work.,the United States,7-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This vacuum is very disappointing. It does not vacuum and wash the floors.  It leaves dirty water behind  And it doesn’t pick up the water. My floors are still dirty.  Don’t buy this. And extreme waste of money.,One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Floor might be to clean now!,the United States,12-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Love this machine!I don’t write many reviews but when I find myself telling everyone I know how amazing this thing is I figure I had to write a review. I have had it for over a month and my floors are so clean that I can now see imperfections that I didn’t realize were even there before. Prior to having this amazing vacuuming mop I hated cleaning the floors and rugs and we have them in every room but now I clean them pretty much every other day and usually the kitchen everyday because it is just so stinking easy to do. You can stop reading other reviews on this awesome machine and just go ahead and buy it. It is so worth it.,
Alexandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Decision I've Made,the United States,22-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This vaccum is the greatest decision I've ever made. I wasn't completely convinced after the first use, even though my floors were pretty cleaned after, but my dog made me change my mind. Afte my siberian husky went ham on one of my potted plants and decided to drag dirt all over my apartment, we plugged in the vacuum and in less than 10 minutes we had squeaky clean hardwood floors again. The device is also very easy to put apart and clean.",2
Jason B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible item—Don’t buy,the United States,29-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I hate this product. I missed the deadline to return it. It’s very loud. You have to take it apart to clean the roller, empty the return and clean the bottle. Even after doing that each time it still has a funky smell to it. I like the vacuum part of it. The mop part doesn’t work well at all. I have to go over spots several times to get the floor somewhat clean. I was really excited about this product. I’ve been using it for several months and do not recommend purchasing this product!",3
Carrie H,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Meh, see update",the United States,2-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Love this thing! Only thing that kinda makes me mad is that it doesn’t get right up close to the edges. I have to take my mop still and go around the edges.**Update**I’ve had this for over two years and I can’t use it anymore. It functions ok (sounds a little weird), but it doesn’t seem to remove as much water as before. I’ve tried brand new Bissell brand parts, but it didn’t do anything to help it. I also cleaned the machine thoroughly and made sure there were no clogs. I never used it more than once or twice a week. If you want this thing to last, don’t use it as much. I’m not looking at other brands, and using my trusty spin mop.",One
Anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best out there,the United States,25-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Very light great steam cleaner. Vacuums even the smallest particles. I have 3 steam cleaners and this is by far my favorite most effective. Steamed and vacuumed a 3000 square foot area on 1 tank of water and in about 30 minutes. No water residue remaining. I used on tile; hardwood; and finished concrete.,One
RonZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nope, this is just a heavy mop",the United States,23-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"ZERO scrubbing power, weak suction power =  just a heavy mop with built-in clean and dirty water buckets.The nylon brush too soft, pretty much like the one you find in typical cheap floor bloom, so it has 0 scrubbing power which makes the roller brush a typical spinning cloth. If you are looking for something that scrubs your tile floor, please look elsewhere.",
Andrea R,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I like it.",the United States,21-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My floors are incredibly dirty and I didn’t realize it until I used the Crosswave. I clean them once per week and the amount of dog hair, my hair and dirt that gets collected is nothing short of amazing. I don’t like that you have to go over areas a few times to pick up all debris. Sometimes it just pushes it along instead of picking it up. The cleaning of the unit is necessary but a bit tedious. The Crosswave makes my floors shine and my area rug smell good. My 8 month crawls around and I’m not worried that she’ll get filthy. If I didn’t like this unit, I would return it. I do feel like it’s a game changer in the cleanliness of my house.",
Sylvia D. Britton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its heavy,the United States,6-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This machine is heavy and a little unwieldy. But it cleans like a dream so I just work up a sweat and have really clean floors. It works well on wood floors, Pergo and vinyl.  I am very satisfied with it so far. I had a lot of trouble with my wet mops leaving dirt and leaving a haze on the floors, this does neither. Worth the money for me.",
Ashley Nicole,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my best purchases,the United States,16-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've wanted this for a very long time. I went through a couple of different brands that are really really good, but they are not the best. The crosswave is the best and I'm very happy that I took the plunge. It was well worth it. My floor cleaning time was cut in half with the crosswave. It's so lightweight and easy to manuever. It's very easy to use and to clean as well.",
JJ & DB,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,the United States,11-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The vacuum feature is not as impressive as I had hoped, we still run a broom to get anything off thr floor that is larger than dust/tiny debris. The wet mopping functionality is good, though.  The crosswave does get into the cracks between boards better than any other tool we've used. I'm pleased with the machine, just temper your expectations a bit if you are hoping this will make all other vacuuming or sweeping unnecessary; we haven't found that to be the case.",One
paula watkins,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s Official! I’m an Adult!,the United States,6-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’m not sure when I turned into an adult and am now excited about a vacuum/mop, but here I am. I love this machine. I don’t love having to pull my hair and my dog’s hair off of the roller or wiping it out of the dirty water tank, but other than that, this Bissel is awesome. The amount of dirt I’ve cleaned off my (what I thought were clean) floors is absolutely disgusting.I do wish there was an unscented cleaner or an option to use my own (gets too foamy if any cleaner other than Bissel).",
gary,5.0 out of 5 stars,A good product I feel,the United States,24-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is the second bissel product I've had for cleaning wood tile floors the first one finally  kinda getting worn out after 10 years. I looked at a lot of different kinds but ended up with this one because of past experience with bissel products I'm just as pleased with this newer model as I was with first this one actually easier to clean and use the brushes work well but nothing beats the old kind on the first machine I had but these work very good . So far I'm very pleased with my choice but the long hall will tell if I made the right choice,
Private,3.0 out of 5 stars,A great idea....,the United States,29-Jun-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really loved this when I first used it.  It pulls a startling amount of dog hair out of the rugs, HOWEVER - it is a very time consuming machine to clean.  It is very fussy, and I ended up spending more time cleaning it after each use than actually USING it.  It is a great idea for a machine, but not very practical and therefore WAY overpriced.  It doesn't really vacuum well enough to be a vacuum, and certainly doesn't mop/steam well enough to be either of those things.  I still would have liked it very much if it hadn't been so darn difficult and time consuming to clean.",5
Nicole V,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly surprised,the United States,31-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was pleasantly surprised by the power of the crosswave. I was also appalled at what my vacuum and rejuvenate cleaning systems were leaving behind. I use this on carpets, rugs, and real hard wood floors. The only thing that’s a bummer is that it doesn’t get the entire way to the walls. So I had to keep my rejuvenate mop for hardwood edges.",

Kenyon Bunker,4.0 out of 5 stars,For light to Medium duty,the United States,7-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum works well on newly made messes but only ok for stuck on messes. It saves a huge amount of time for sweeping and moping, now we just do both at the same time. makes keeping the house clean and easy. Great for when you have young kids or pets that make a lot of messes. Not ideal for medium to thick carpets. We only have 2 rooms in my house with medium shag carpet. It does ok with them. Super easy to clean and maintain.",
Jules,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Three months and it starts leaving dirty water streaks during use. Fourth month, and now, as soon as you place the water tank in all of the water/solution mix pours right out of the bottom.You have to clean in out after each use. That takes longer than doing the floors🤦🏽‍♀️.I wasted almost $300 and I get better results with my steamer! Don’t bother.",
KLD in NJ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Leaves soapy, dirty puddles all over the floor",the United States,18-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If I could leave negative starts I would. The brush gets so wet it starts leaving puddles all over the bare floor. Going over the puddles without pressing the solution dismemberment button does not help. Had to get down and wipe the puddles with paper towel only to discover the area of the floor that was ""cleaned"" was still dirty as evidenced by the filthy paper towel once the puddles were dried.  It's to bad. Bissell has a nice idea, just think the product was released before it was fully tested.  Did not dare to try this on an area rug given the puddling issues.",One
Erica,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for large areas,the United States,22-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Completely regret this purchase and for using it and not returning it. I have a lot of floor space and this isn't for big areas. It's too time consuming. And it's a very expensive vacuum for small spills. I wouldn't use it for small pet messes on the carpet either. It was torture. A handheld that is made for that job would be better.,
Chris J,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bad on Hair/Loud,the United States,4-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The machine is louder than I expected which I can live with. The other issue is hair, human hair, not dog hair. It gets wrapped around the bristles and difficult to get out. Maybe I need to try what is used for dog hair although the human hair is longer than the dog hair in my situation. Not sure it would matter. Overall, I do like the machine and it has cut down significant time I'm spending cleaning the floors.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for dog hair,the United States,2-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Have used several times now. One tank cleans about 500 sq ft. I refill clean tank and empty dirty tank in toilet (but do not clean out until finished). Works great for hardwood, tile, and painted concrete floors. Very little water remains on floor, especially if the spray trigger is released (and go over area again). Have a dog that sheds and it works to 'sweep&mop' in one pass. Cleaning up machine is a bit messy. I flush the dirty tank contents down the toilet. Then rinse everything in bathtub. It takes a couple days for brush to dry (kept in basement). In my hands, floors look better than mopping but not as good as washing and drying on hands and knees (which still needs to happen in tight spots like around toilets). Have not used to clean rugs and carpets.",
Terri,2.0 out of 5 stars,So disappointed,the United States,23-Nov-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am a fan of Bissell products but this was a huge waste of money! I've used it twice and both times it has left dirty streaks when my floor dried and I had to go back an re-mop with my Bissell stream mop which works great! Finally, even though it supposedly saves time because you can vacuum and mop at one time, it takes at least 15 minutes to  take it apart, clean it and put it back together when all the parts are dry. Wish I hadn't purchased and can't return because I don't have the box anymore. I was sure this would be a great product, but NOT!",One

I used this recently in my master bathroom where the tile has build up of hair product. This mop handled it perfectly. No need for me to get on my hands and knees to clean. So glad that I made the purchase. Only thing I wish was that it had the capability to heat the water. I end up filling the tank with hot tap water and it works just as great.",
Laura Lou,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,16-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this Crosswave. I looked at it for a long time and finally got it. I have a lot of LVT and this keeps them sparkling clean in much less time than usual. It was rare when I was able to mop every floor on the same day, but now I do regularly. The mopping is perfect. My only complaint is the suction for dry stuff isn’t the best. It can’t handle spilled salt at all and things like cookie crumbs take a couple passes. It’s not fantastic with corners and if you go too fast it will push crumbs against the wall/cabinets and leave them. However, I definitely recommend.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing to have for Wooden floor,the United States,8-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant at first looking at some of the negative reviews. However we bought it eventually; not a single day passes when I don’t thank myself for buying this piece. The best cleaning device to have.I have cleaned rugs, floor, coffee stains off the rug, marks of the hard floor and this cleans everything and the suction is just amazing. It takes less than an hour for me to do professional level cleaning wet and dry in my 900sft apartment.Please don’t waste time in thinking and just buy it. Value for money and quick to use, assemble and clean.Only be mindful of cleaning the device after cleaning house and dry all the moving detachable parts. That’s it and you’re ready to go.",
Jon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete junk,the United States,21-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Absolutely useless. The device barely gets the floors wet, but it still can’t manage to suck up any of the water it puts down. After multiple slow passes, you end up with streaks of water on the floor and none in the tank. The brush itself spins but doesn’t seem to make much contact with the floor and doesn’t come close to cleaning anything. A wet swiffer does a better job.",One
John F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,but after using it I have to say it does an amazing job cleaning the floors,the United States,15-Feb-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This product has made my life so much easier in the cleaning department.  I was skeptical at first, but after using it I have to say it does an amazing job cleaning the floors.  With a regular mop, there was always dirt left behind.  Not with this vacuum!  With my steam mop the floors always looked streaked, not with the crosswave!  The floors come out clean and streak free.The downside?  I don't feel like it handles pet hair well, so I always vacuum my rugs first.  Secondly, it just can't get in the edges well, so I always go back to those with a regular vacuum.  Still, for a quick clean this is a wonderful product!",One

I am on a cleaning team at my church and I used it on our white tile bathroom floors, otherpeople noticed how clean they were, said they had never looked better!

Shelley Fox,2.0 out of 5 stars,Tile floors,the United States,12-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If you have tile floors forget about this! It's a mop not a floor scrubber.  I have to go over my floors again and again to get any paw prints off my floors then it drags all the dirt back into the grout.

Vernsen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love It! Quick, clean floors",the United States,24-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Mops gross me out a bit because I feel like I'm just dragging dirt across the floor. This is nice because it sucks up all of the dirt off the floor, and it can be used in one step. There's no need to sweep beforehand. I do sweep before if there's a bit of extra dirt, but I don't think that's even necessary as the floors are always spotless when I'm done whether I've swept or not. Cleaning up afterward is also easy. I finish up in the bathroom, empty the waste into the toilet, and rinse everything in the bathtub. The stand lets everything dry out, no problem. It's a little pricey, but definitely worth the money.",

Dighur,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Vacuums, but doesn’t clean very well",the United States,5-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is an ok vacuum for bare floors. It does not mop well. It is unable to clean about 1 inch from the wall so you end upOn your hands and knees scrubbing around objects and baseboards. It also does a poor job cleaning any large area. The scrubber is cloth therefore once it is dirty you are just spreading around dirty water. Dirt tends to gather at the ‘squeegee’ and if you do not stop to clean it Avery so often it leaves muddy streaks. However, we have no carpet, so I have large expanses of bare floors, so maybe a smaller kitchen or bath would be ok.  Replacing mine with a new floormate like I had before. The floormate does a better job",

JVK,4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly Good,the United States,4-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was surprised at how well it cleaned my tile floors.  The only draw back to these type of machines is the clean up.  It really wasn't too bad but warning, the only one with a strainer basket built in is the pet version.  The first time I dumped it into my sink I was flabbergasted.  The 2nd time I used an old food strainer to pour the dirty water through to keep the big stuff out of my drain pipes.  The fact that the whole idea is to not have to vacuum before washing, should have told bissell that there will be a lot of gunk that shouldn't go down your drain.  Thus 4 instead of 5 stars.  I haven't used it on my hardwood floor yet but expect good results.",

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Product!!!!,the United States,12-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I cannot speak highly enough about this product. I have hardwood floors throughout and I dreaded cleaning them. I’d vacuum then wash them. This product does both! At the same time. Two things I learned when using it. Go with the grain of the wood which leaves no streaks. And I replaced the cleaning solution with vinegar. Fill to the water line then use vinegar in place of their cleaning solution. I have a cat whom sheds terribly despite daily brushing. This product is wonderful!,

I have area rugs and hardwood floors in my home and this product cleaned my rugs really well.

I was very hesitate to order based on the mixed reviews, but this product is amazing.  Like many of the other reviews we realized how filthy, dirty our ""clean"" floors were after using the Bissell one time.  The water was like mud.Other products push the dirt around, the Bissell picks it up.  The rotating brush scrubs up dirt that other products would swiff right over.How impressive was this product?  My wife took it to her mom's house and did her floors.  Then she took it to my mom's house and did her floors.  They found out their floors weren't so clean either.The one recommendation I would make is design that would allow you to get closer to baseboards and into tight spaces (between toliet and wall).",14
Jackson M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compared Bissell Symphony Pet to Bissell Crosswave,the United States,15-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had a hard time deciding between the Symphony Pet and the Bissell Crosswave so I ordered both.  I liked the fact that the symphony pet had a steam feature and I thought it would clean better.  I was completely wrong!  When I received the two I had not mopped my floor in several days.  The steam mop was slower in getting up spills, the pad got dirty quickly and was really no better than my previous Bissell steam mop. The Crosswave is amazing and that is the one I kept!  It cleans great and is very quick to use.  Make sure to pay attention to directions  - use hot water and when you start it up each time hold handle for 10 sec until you see bubbles on the cleaning brush - that means it is primed and ready to go!",
Fredda N.,2.0 out of 5 stars,After Care of Machine,the United States,2-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The cleanup after it vacuums and washes the floor is very time consuming.  I bought this to make this job easier.  It takes me at least 10-15 minutes to cleanup  the parts of the bissell.  I am sorry that I did not buy just the steam machine.  The Cord is very long and makes me feel that the cordless would have been a better investment. However , cleanup would probably be the same.  I would like to return it but I thew away the box.

Chris blazor,3.0 out of 5 stars,Needs packaged better great product,the United States,27-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Its an awesome mop vac cleans well i honestly have nothing bad to say of the performance. With that being said i rate it a 3 because the collar at the base came broken and the mop vac bottom was popped out i had to remove the back black cover to put it back in to make it stand up. And also the collar came broken with the head popped off. Only thing i can ask is put more care into the shipping end and package it a bit better.

Doesn’t do well on my linoleum in the kitchen and very hard to push on the rugs. Basically have to clean it every time you use it or it’ll clog... too expensive for how much I use it.

Bob Hughes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,the United States,25-Sep-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Does a great job leaves the floor relatively dry. One interesting thing is it does not spray the water on the floor but on the brush, so you end up with the brush doing all the work at 1st I thought this was a little funky but then as I been using it it's a great solution versus my old Hoover which sprayed on the floor didn't get it up and left the dirty, so this is a vast improvement",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where has this machine been all of my adult life?!,the United States,1-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So I cleaned my downstairs with this today. Kitchen with laminate floor, and dining room and living room with area rugs and hardwood floors. It lights up like a robot when you switch it on, so naturally my son and I had a wrestling match over who got to start washing with it. My son won, but once it started turning into work (after thirty seconds) he handed it over to me. I watched this thing simultaneously suck up the debris on my floors and carpets, while spitting warm soapy water down and sucking dirty water back up. There are buttons on the handle so that as you roll along, you can switch back and forth between rug and floor. My floors and rugs turned this impossible shade of clean. When the dirty tank becomes full, it makes this noise like an airplane taking off and you just switch it off and easily take the tank out of the compartment and dump its foul contents. It is lightweight and is on a ball swivel so handles nicely. It also has a low profile so you can get part of the way under buffets, cocktail table, sofas. You can easily pop the cover off and rinse off the roller brush and insides if they get too gunky. This was way too easy. Go get one of these immediately.",

K Shan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,the United States,5-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Easy to use, cleans without effort, sucks up dirty water unlike mops that leave a dirty residue.

Robert,4.0 out of 5 stars,"great machine, but don't buy on amazon",the United States,14-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this model by mistake. I wanted the cordless version because my house has 3 floors. When it arrived I thought that I would take advantage of the amazon return policy and try it out for 30 days; my return instructions were to pack back up in the box it came in and take to UPS. The problem being that once you snap the handle in place, there is no release---you can't disassemble and put back in the box, so I am stuck with it. No real regrets, since it does a pretty good job and generally plug in models have more power, but it might be wiser to buy from a brick and mortar store so that you can take it back if you don't like it or if defective.",

However as soon as I turned on the power and added water and cleaning solution, I realize just how easy and light this machine is. My floors have never been clean!!!  The robot vacuum head just clean the floors, so I didn’t think I would pick up much hair or other debris, boy was I wrong! If you think mopping get your floors clean mop first and then use the cross wave! You will be impressed with this machines cleaning ability! My only regret is I didn’t buy this sooner!

Aleesha,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for disabled households,the United States,27-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I wholeheartedly believe that this vacuum works well. It isn't perfect at all, but it is really useful and beats a swiffer any day hands down. I have to pre treat the area with a cleaner that I dilute with water and add a couple drops of dawn dish soap to. Otherwise in my messy house, this vacuum would be useless. You do have to go over areas at least twice for them to be really clean. The pictures I attached are before and after of my little hallway.

Chrystal McGovern,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend,the United States,15-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is by far the most amazing all in one vacuum! I have three dogs (one is a husky so FUR),  two cats, and two kids (plus all of my sons friends) in my house. While I vacuum every day I usually only get to mopping once a week. This makes it so much simpler to get both done at once and it does a fantastic job. We have hardwood floors and area rugs and this makes switching between the two effortless. The suction is great, it is super lightweight, and easy to maneuver. Seriously if you are looking for an all in one vacuum, this is the one to get!",
Dakota,4.0 out of 5 stars,Get's the Job Done on Stained-Pet-Hair-Covered Rugs!,the United States,6-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was very afraid to invest in an expensive vacuum cleaner for my area rug as I have a dog who sheds more that you can ever imagine. I didn't think it would be possible for a vacuum to pick up of her fur with out breaking. Seriously. She sheds an alarming amount of hair all year round. Up until now, every 2 weeks I would get on my hands and knees and use a tiny rubber nozzled hand vacuum to pick up all the fur for a solid hour (the rug is 5' x 7'), but it did nothing for the dirt or stains.Ive had my rug for 2 years and have never gotten it cleaned. Two weeks ago I realized that it was absolutely disgusting and a completely different color than when i first bought it and decided it was time to make the jump. I thought it was too good to be true to find a vacuum meant to pick up pet hair AND deep clean the floors and rugs, so I placed the order immediately.I will say, this vacuum makes you work hard. I had to do many more passes than instructed and had to clean out the filter 3 times in total, but considering I had never cleaned my rug before I can't really make a fuss about it. On top of that, it picked up more pet hair than I've ever seen. I am very impressed with the results, as you can see from the pictures below. While the vacuum didn't completely dry out the rug after cleaning it, the rug looks pretty much like new, its completely free of pet hair and smells amazing! & I'm sure with regular use the upkeep will get easier.",One

Michael Nestor,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for hardwood floors, not so much for rugs.",the United States,19-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Works great for hardwood floors. It is a time saver because it vacuums and mops at the same tjme. Afterwards, simply rinse the tank and clean the beater by setting in it a tray (included) of clean water and  no let it run to rinse itself out.I will not be using it to clean the throw rugs, though.

My first one worked well, the second one would hardly squirt out any water, so it took longer to mop my floors.  With the Bissell and the brush roller that works like a regular vacuum it picks up so much more dirt.  I also love how much easier it is to clean after use.  I put the vacuum cleaner on the cleaning tray then pour what is left over in my cleaning solution bottle into the tray and turn on the vacuum.  It gets rid of most of the yucky stuff.  Then I disassembled and clean in my deep sink, it is a snap.  I wipe down the vacuum, let the parts dry, reassemble and it is ready to use again.

Instead of just using this product, I'm finding that I'm having to go over my floors with my old tools. Cleaning the container is not easy, the filter dirtied up within a few uses even after trying to clean the filter as the instructions says. It does not do a good job of picking up the dirt even when I use the mop mode. When I turn off the vacuum and go to pick it up to put away, and I've just used the mop feature, i find myself having to go over the floor with a rag seeing as it leaves a dirty ""puddle"" no matter how much or little I use the mop spray.

I rave about it always to my family and friends and could have my own infomercial if I could!  I’ve had mine for almost a year and just purchased one for my daughter in law who has an all hardwood home!  The downside, if any, is that you have to make sure you clean it after every use, and let it dry out fully before reassembling it to store away.  I usually use it at least once a week, and have a large separate laundry room that I keep it in, so it’s never a problem. I.

My home is now clean enough and my conscience is now clear.",One
the bon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If using daily, have replacement parts",the United States,31-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Definitely need extra rollers and filters. Does not do well as vacuum unless roller is wet. If you have tile that is textured, you will need extra top that you remove to clean/replace roller as the edge of  plastic blade (sqeegee) will become wavy and lose effectiveness. I did wonder why that part was included in bundles. Unfortunately, I bought filters and rollers in bundles before I realized I was wearing away the squeegee. Time consuming to clean machine after cleaning floors.",
Bailey Burns,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,27-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is an excellent product!  We have used it twice and it works as expected.  I did thoroughly clean it after both uses and let dry completely before reassembling.  I used it on tile floors and it did a great job cleaning up pet hair and food spills.  It certainly does not replace a good mopping, but it is good to use in-between mopping days.This is an update to my previous review.  I still love this cleaner!  Yes, you need to disassemble it after each use, but why wouldn't you want to clean something?  You empty your vacuum cleaner, right??  I use it once a week and our tile floor has never looked better.",2
Jennie Russell,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t Clean Hardwood Floors,the United States,29-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I wish I had returned this when I had the chance. It’s pretty terrible for hardwood floors. I even used a hardwood floor cleaner and it streaks badly. You almost have to fully sweep and mop before using the Crosswave which completes defeats the purpose. My Swiffer Wet does a much better job at cleaning the floors. I doubt I’ll pay this much for an appliance again.,
SHARLEE,2.0 out of 5 stars,Beware.,the United States,9-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this in March and was happy with it.

Kimberly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great suction for sweeping and mopping all at once!,the United States,14-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a toddler that throws her food on the floor at every meal. I don’t like the swiffer mops, I don’t think they do a very good job. This product has incredible suction power and cleans all the sticky mess off the floor. My only suggestion is make sure that you clean it every night if you’ve used it that day for mopping because it’s  harder to clean if it sits overnight whereas if you do it the same day you just rinse off the parts and set it out to dry so it’s ready for the next use. I love mine and think it’s totally worth the extra 5 minutes to clean.",

I have 3 dogs, cat, and a toddler. The device worked great for a few months, then the top of the acrylic above the brush was broken. Easy enough, I was able to buy a replacement and continue cleaning. Not even a month after I replaced, the brush stopped spinning. I went through all the trouble shooting videos, cleaned, reset, used different outlets, etc. NOTHING WORKED. I am super disappointed that I haven't even gotten it to work a full year without error. The only thing to do now is bring to a repair shop, which is totally on my top things to do during the COVID crisis (NOT!). I guess this one is done for.",One

Samuel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy the cross wave and save time and perhaps $$!1,the United States,27-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It’s not perfect. However if you get the hang of it it’s worth every penny. We have a cleaning service that come x2 a week. I definitely don’t need them 2x a week anymore - I was able to go through our main & bedroom floors in no time. What I didn’t like was cleaning the vacuum dirt and dirty water mix- gross.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for ceramic tile.,the United States,17-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Used this on my ceramic tile floors and it worked great.  My floors are very wavy so I found that if I used the rug button to put the solution on it was much faster.  The rug feature puts out more solution which I needed for all the groves and grout.  I have a Bissel spot clean machine that I love and wanted this one to do whole floors.  It was simple to clean machine after use as you just rinse and air dry.,2
JOSL BKLYN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where has this been all my life?  I LOVE a this machine.,the United States,20-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this so much!  It does a great job with fur.  It’s incredibly easy to use and set up.  It’s done and incredible job on my bamboo floors.  It’s also great on area rugs.  Both rugs and floors dry with a few minutes after cleaning them.  Rugs take a bit more time but not much.  This machine will make my life so much easier.,

Vacuum alone is never enough, Swiffer is ridiculous and then you have to mop anyway. This does it all and it PICKS UP EVERYTHING. No litter, no pet hair or sand is left behind. Easy to use, lightweight and fast. Cleaning it is very easy- rinse a couple parts and let dry. I got extra parts but have had no problems yet. I feel this is worth every penny spent and every one saved on not having to buy and try different options. Bissell has rocked it with this machine!",One
Erica,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great and easy to use,the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I haven’t had this long and only used it a handful of times but love it so far!

Just make sure you give it all time to dry before putting it away and storing it!",

jackie ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,5-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The crosswave has changed my life. I have large home with hardwood and area rugs.

carol robbins,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than a mop,the United States,18-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was using the swifter mops. Didn't like the chemicals or the amount of liquid it left on the floor. I LOVE THIS CLEANER!! Can't say it enough. It's easy to use, doesn't leave a mess of water and I can use my own mix of cleaner.  Before I use it I moped my kitchen at usual with the swifter mops. Then I used the Bissell and the water was filthy, even after moping it the first time. I'm all for easy and this it it.",
Mark ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaking dirty water all over the floor,the United States,18-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I initially loved it and I think it's a great idea. However, the machine started leaking dirty water about a month ago. I always made sure to clean all the parts properly after each use. Today it made a loud noise and stopped working all together. I am not sure if it's a faulty machine or bad design. I am disappointed and will look for something similar now, but a different brand. I am in desperate search for efficient laminate floor cleaner machine.",
patricia tanona,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is great!,the United States,31-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love this thing.  I think all of my friends now have purchased this vacuum that I rave about. I can’t believe how well this works on my tile and hardwood floors.  I use it in my entry way mats too.  I have two dogs and I’m always amazed at the amount of hair it picks up (after I have swept). Honestly no need to sweep first, this thing picks up pieces of dog food, coins, etc. but why tempt fate… honestly this is a great vacuum for a reasonable price.",
BernieR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked on Red Wine Spill!!!,the United States,26-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had a half glass of red wine fall off the end of my coffee table last night and break into pieces on my rug.  I picked up all the broken glass I could, then took out my other vacuum cleaner to clean up the remaining smaller pieces.  I was left with a depressing large red wine spill.  I decided out my new Bissell CrossWave carpet cleaner in an attempt to clean up some of the spilled wine. After a several swipes, the stain disappeared.  I wish I had taken a before pic, but here is the after pic and the reservoir containing the removed wine.  Not sure if the magic is in the machine or the cleaning solution, but I'm super stoked that I don't have to buy a new rug.  I was in crisis mode, so I didn't measure the solution, but I'm sure it was on the strong side.  I'm very happy (and lucky) I purchased this product.",4

Leslie J Brady,5.0 out of 5 stars,This works great and is so easy to use!,the United States,21-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love the fact that the Bissell is small and light and doesn't require any ""prep-work"" to use. I use it on my tile floor. It has replaced my mop and my floors are so much cleaner than when I used a mop. When mopping, the dirty water is pushed around and spread into the grout lines. With this floor cleaner that is no longer a problem, because it sucks up the dirty water immediately. Also, when I mopped, I always carried a ""scrubber-sponge"" around to get a spot up that the mop alone couldn't get clean. The first time I used this machine, I had my scrubber-sponge in hand and ready to use as I was accustomed to, but I didn't have to use it at all! The rotating brush cleaned beautifully! On the tougher spots I just rolled over a few times. I don't own a mop anymore and I don't carry around a scrubber-sponge when I clean my floors anymore either.",One

Turned my 1.5 hour scrubbing of my kitchen floor into a 15 minute job tops. Vacuums and mops at same time. I can do kitchen, from door landing, three bathrooms, laundry room, breezeway, and landing at top of stairs in about 30-40 minutes. As you can see in the pic, I am a Bissell fan. I also have the handheld carpet cleaner (not pictured). I love all their products that are for pet fur removal.",

This time it did not work at all after doing the steps.  It also now does not turn the brush at all.  I am so upset, I paid a lot for this to work and now I have a useless machine.  I used the recommended cleaning solution too and always packed it away as they recommend and cleaned out.  I just don't understand why it is broken other than the machine just sucks!

Patricia Rodriguez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice and neat design vacuum,the United States,17-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Works very well on my rug (medium deep).

I have tried to shampoo my area rugs and like I said before the suction is terrible. Also, it hardly sprays out the solution/water mix.I am sure it is too late for a refund by now. Lastly, if it seems to good to be true it probably is!",
Lisa Ryder,2.0 out of 5 stars,Tile Floor Fail ☹,the United States,19-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Figured this would save me time (I clean for a living) but it was a waste of money.It does not work well on tile floors, especially if they are a little uneven height wise.Doesn't clean close enough to base boards & not at all in corners.Reservoirs for clean & dirty liquids are very small.Also, it is Extremely loud ☹",2
angelacez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just get it!!!,the United States,17-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have 5 kids and 3 indoor animals.  It saves so much time and effort and does a great job!  I used it throughout my entire upstairs and I can say I swept first and had mopped recently, the floor was still disgusting!  The water was so dark!  It got hair I didn't even see.  Just get it.  Honestly wish I'd heard of this years ago.  Such a time saver!!!",
Amber U.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It sucks, but not in a good way.",the United States,9-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It worked great for a month. Then, no matter how much I cleaned the machine out, cleaned the mop head (and even bought new ones), it leaves dirty streaky water marks everywhere! When I lift it off the ground there is a pool of dirty water. The floor ends up looking dirtier than i started. I’m really disappointed because it had the potential to make my cleaning so much faster.",
Merri K. Rosales,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift that was loved!,the United States,12-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This was a Christmas gift for my son and he loved it! He and his family had just moved into their new house and it was already being used as soon as it arrived! It is highly functional light weight easy to maneuver and great for households with little ones and pets. Easily transitions from wet to dry and hardwood, tile or carpet.",2
Erin W.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wanted to love this but falls short,the United States,8-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,So excited to try this - but it ends up taking me twice as long to do my floors as it does to use a regular vacuum and mop.It sucks up fine but the wheels leave horrible dirty streaks in their wake and you have to go over them again in just the right spot to clean them up.Definitely not worth the price tag!,

Ron L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for cleaning pet messes.,the United States,10-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I use the Crosswave for kitchen and hardwood floors.

Patricia A. Rabbitt,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the effort,the United States,18-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My biggest issue with this product is that every single time it is used, you need to take it apart and clean it too. If you don’t, and you make the mistake I did and leave it overnight, the smell of moldy wet disgusting rotary brush gags you. It’s more work than it’s worth.",
Lance Jensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an excellent home solution floor cleaner,the United States,25-Apr-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this to replace a Bissell Mult-Surface ""HeatWave Technology"" Unit.  I wish I had purchased this unit originally.  It cleans hard surfaces MUCH better and is incredibly easy to use.I was at first concerned that the smaller volume of cleaning solution would be a problem,  This turned out not to be the case.  The CrossWave cleans more effectively with less solution.  Nice side effect, the floors dry much faster.I am using this on a combination of sealed bamboo and epoxy pebble flooring.  I am using the multi-surface brush roll to better handle the texture of the pebble floor.  I was aghast at the sludge this unit picked up a day after using my old Bissell.  Or in other words how much cleaner the floor is now and will be in the future.The literature says that ""pre-vacuuming"" is not needed.  I disagree only because I have to large dogs that shed continuously and in large quantities.  I've been know to pre-vacuum with a shop vac so I don't kill my Dyson.Pre-vacuuming still will not catch all the hair/dirt, and this was a frequent source of frustration with my old Bissell.  It would clog often.  The CrossWave handled these with aplomb.  In fact it did much better than I expected.Pros,Extremely effectiveLight/Easy to maneuverUses less solutionhandles the stray hairball/dirt without clogging.ConsCord could be longerCord could attach to the unit at the top of the handle making handling easierDoes not edge clean well (The only place the old Bissell was better).This is an excellent home solution floor cleaner",12
Kathy,3.0 out of 5 stars,No good.,the United States,21-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Pros, water comes out easy.Cons, water streaks on floor. It does not suck all the water up, and the hair gets stuck shortly after using. I would not purchase this unit again..I have dog's and the reviews were great. This is why I purchased this unit. However, it should say it works great for certain size dogs. Ie. Extremely small dogs. Save your money and purchase a different unit.",One

One of the more rewarding cleaning investment purchases we’ve made for our new home.",
Yirlen,4.0 out of 5 stars,good,the United States,12-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Actually, as a vacuum it is not the best, also it does not have the adapter to suck in small places, but as a mop it is very good, I have a ceramic floor and this is the only thing I have found that leaves the floor very clean, after using thousands  of products that did not work, but you already know that the small corners have to be cleaned with something else because this vacuum does not reach those small places",
Pamela,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great suction & spotless floor cleaner,the United States,7-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Great vacuum & floor cleaner.  Good suction, cleans floors leaving behind no visible dirt, I did a white wipe cloth test several times. I used on ceramic & plank flooring. I would expect it to work just as well on hardwood floors. Note if dirty water tank full, it will leave pools of water on floor, I saw this mentioned in other reviews.. so you need to empty when it gets to full line. The instructions easy to follow and it’s very user friendly.  Vacuum higher priced, more than I wanted to spend on a floor cleaner but otherwise happy with this purchase.",
Janet C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!!!,the United States,9-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It was easy to use and clean. I have many pets and my laminate takes a beating. Before I cleaned it, I swept it so it was clean of dirt and hair. But it got up a lot more dirt than I could see and because it sucks up the dirty water, it's relatively dry as soon as you clean it. It was great not to have to yell at people and pets to get off the wet floor, and I could quickly move furniture back to where it belonged and finish the whole room at the same time ,instead of having to wait for one section to dry, and then move the furniture and then do the rest of the floor. It also worked great on throw rugs. I don't know why anyone would not like this product, I thought it was awesome.",2
Bethany Lee,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's... Okay,the United States,25-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It's not worth the money... I have kitchen floors that are difficult to clean. I was tired of feeling like Cinderella so I decided to get the product. It works fine, but it doesn't deep clean like I had expected. Plus, the rotating pad stinks. I've cleaned it multiple times with bleach and in the dishwasher but it still leaves a smell. I honestly wish I could return it, but too much time has passed at this point.",

Harris Gwinn,4.0 out of 5 stars,The cleanup is a pain in the posterior,the United States,5-Nov-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The Bissell works quite well at combining vacuum, mopping and sweeping, however the cleanup of the machine is ridiculous. In the instructions it pictures the user rinsing the dirty water container in the sink but it does not show where to dump the dirty water and the pet hair that is in the dirty water. I am not going to pour all the dog hair down my kitchen sink and have taken to using the hose outside on the grass. you also have to take the brush out,the brush cover, the body of the machine and the filter and filter housing on top of the dirty water tank. It is a serious pain and I think I will give it away.",

Jarrod D Ward,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn’t a good fit for me,the United States,28-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We have a lot of sand and for some reason it doesn’t suck the sand all the way up and every time you stop the machine it would spit it back out ....so the first time after using it I didn’t realize it until I was done and I had small piles of sand around the house .....so I returned it,2
jgc9,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the cleanup after use,the United States,24-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Not worth the trouble of what you have to do  after using it. It Didn’t vacuum and clean kitchen floors that great with some dirt and debri still streamed on floor where I finished.  Had to pick up mess with paper towel where I turned off the vacuum. Would not reccomend,
Ronald G. Crowe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed,the United States,25-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've used it several times; it actually cleaned the grout in my bathroom! And that's been a problem for years without getting on my knees with a toothbrush. Cleans the wood floors nicely (drool from the dog) and dries them quite well, too. Also used it on a couple places where there were milk stains on the rug; did very well there, also. Easy to use and light weight. Instructions thorough. Used to hate mopping with a sponge or string mop. This is practically a pleasure!",
KClark,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not particularly happy,the United States,17-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"For Small jobs- it's fine, but for major cleaning not so fine.  Having to clean the unit after I finished , I  kept wondering if a mop and bucket would be easier.  Trouble with dispensing the cleaning solution, will have to find where I put the instructions to see what's going on. Over all I've only had the unit a week so maybe things will get better.  Hope so!",2
Emily ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves Traces on Hardwood Floors,the United States,10-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was super excited to get this thinking that my cleanup time would be reduced! If you are only using it for vacuuming, it works pretty well. However, it tends to leaves streaks on my hardwood floors. On my tile, the solution builds up between them and then I have to clean it was a toothbrush or use my regular mop to get it out. Overall, I wish I would’ve researched more before buying...",
phillip barnard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love,the United States,22-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Love love love!!! This makes my life so much easier. I have babies and I am very particular about my floors because they crawl and always end up eating their snacks off the floor. With the crosswave I know my floors are clean. I have gotten so many compliments on how clean my floors always are. I highly recommend this product!,
Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm in love!,the United States,16-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Purchased during Black Friday for a decent price. This thing is amazing. I hate I've waited this long to purchase one. It came with a small bottle of solution which lasted me several runs of about 1,000 sqft each.I own 2 cats. The crosswave is a perfect addition to my home. I would love the filter features that come with the pet version. But, I do not think it's worth $100 extra price tag. I just flush everything into the commode with no problems. You definitely should clean the brush and trap with every use or it'll begin to smell.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing product,the United States,10-Sep-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I used this on my floors and then went over it with my steam mop and I got so much dirt on the pad of my Steam Mop that should have been picked up by this mop. It sucked up debris fine but the mopping feature wasn't great at all. For this price point I would expect it to get my floors very clean. I have a crawling baby so I have to keep my floors very clean. It's also a pain to take apart and clean all the pieces after each use, I'm definitely returning this...",2
DHuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever,the United States,15-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I don’t even like to wash floors but find myself using this regularly. So easy!

Julianne Hansen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my gallery floor,the United States,7-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I own an art gallery that also contains a working pottery studio.  The dust from the clay is overwhelming at times, but a regular mop just spreads it around, reconstitutes the clay and streaks it across the floor.  This product is a God-send!!!!  Not only does it clean the floors, it sucks up and contains the soiled water in a nice container that is easily emptied.  The roller brush easily comes out and can be rinsed and dried on the accompanying rack.  Well designed and easy to use!  THANK YOU!!!!  I LOVE IT!",
lindsay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every single penny!!,the United States,29-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Screw a Tineco. I never should have listened to the strangers on the internet that said it was better than this bad boy. This thing is incredible. It exceeded every expectation and then some. My house is a little over 2200 sq feet and I only had to refill the water tank twice. With the Tineco, I had to refill it every 5 minutes and that was so annoying. My ONLY complaint is that I bought a Tineco first.Here’s the scoop, poop- if you’re even so much as considering getting one of these, do yourself a favor and just do it. It’s worth every single penny.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent machine,the United States,10-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Our house is all wood floors with tile in the bathrooms.  We bough this product to improve on our floor cleaning.  We have only used it one time but we did the whole house and it works great.  It is a good design and easy to use.  It is a little loud but who cares it cleans floors like crazy.  The vacuum suction is strong and it gets into corners and along baseboards.  It is supposed to be good for rugs too but we haven't tried that yet.  Super happy with this machine.,
kristina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good investment great floor cleaner!,the United States,15-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just used it for the first time. And I have to say I am extremely impressed.  This is exactly what I wanted,  drys fast, challenging spots took a couple passes.  AMAZIN in area rugs. Seems well built and was easy to put together and easy to use, and easy to clean. I’m very pleased with this perchase.",
Valerie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,25-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love this. It does a great job on both floors and indoor/outdoor carpet. My floors are much clear and easier to sweep and mop at the same time.  When I first moved in here carpet was kind of nasty after a few rounds of using this it made a huge difference, now when I mop my floors I do the carpets also",
Rkreitl,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t seem to mop well,the United States,9-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’ve used this only as a mop due to multiple dog household but the spray and brush don’t seem to get wet enough to really brush and suck up dirt.  I will use it over and over in one area, let dry and try again and it just turns out streaky.  It’s an expensive purchase and I missed the return date because I kept hoping it would do better.",
KIBENNETTS,1.0 out of 5 stars,LONGEVITY FAIL! (Power failure after 4 months use of @ 1-2x per week),the United States,12-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was initially singing the praises of this machine! Vacuuming and mopping in one device...wohoo! My floors (hardwood, tile and area rugs) looked wonderful! ...and then...the power began to go off when engaging the brush (i.e. moving the handle back). This is an extremely disappointing device longevity issue...particularly for the price of over $200. I have contacted Bissell about it and, so far, no answer. I've got a $200 piece of junk on my hands.",
JCE,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good!,the United States,18-Nov-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So far I've cleaned the downstairs area which is completely tile twice and it works brilliantly.  I think my only ""complaint"" if you want to call it that is I wish the brush was about another 3~5"" wider to cover more area.  Otherwise its perfect.  Very easy to use and even tilts at an angle making it easy to get around corners.",2

C. J. Morillo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Machine!,the United States,29-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I read the reviews before I purchased and decided to take a chance. I have a 3000 sq ft home that is ALL ceramic tile. I was cleaning the floors with a broom and a Swiffer. UGH! The Bissell CrossWave did it all in one shot! I did all the floors in a total of about 3 hours. I am very happy as it does exactly what it says it does. The only reason I gave is 4 stars instead of 5 is that I really wish it came with an attachment to vacuum small areas or small jobs. I'm still going to have to get a handheld Dustbuster (or similar). Five stars would be a removable small vacuum included.,One
K.C. Van Voorhis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not very good,the United States,12-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This thing doesn't do well around edges or in corners. I can't even get what's on the floors along the baseboards. You can't vacuum under things because the head tips upward losing contact with the floor. Overall this gets a thumbs down. I really wish there were a scrubbing roller too. The tiny little bristles on the roller do little to clean up tougher messes.,
kerry,1.0 out of 5 stars,A very expensive mop,the United States,20-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum worked very well for about 3 months. I bought it specifically to clean my hardwood floors and the nature stone floor in my basement.  After about three months I noticed it was not sucking up any of the water that it sprayed on the floor. It was still under warranty so I called. I had to take it to a repair shop 45 minutes from my house. The repair did nothing to solve the problem.  Bissell agreed to send me a new machine. The exact same thing happened. I spend $ on new filters, brushes and cleaning fluid. This machine is a very expensive mop. Save yourself time and money- don’t buy it.",One

Wow!",2
Maegan Giancola ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk-do not buy,the United States,21-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Do not buy this unless you are trying to clean Polly Pocket's closet. This simply does not work as described. You would be better off vacuuming and using a swifer. The suction is consistent with a child's play toy, and the ""mop"" part is crap. You have to go over the same section...slowley...at least 5 passes for ANYTHING to be cleaned. The whole concept is for efficiency...but the thing does not work. It takes such a long time, and you still do not get a clean floor. It leaves dirty water streaks and clogs trying to suck up dust. I'm honestly so disappointed.",
Alan F. Washburn,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay but i'm not sold.,the United States,18-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to love it... and I use it. However, for me the mop part has much to be improved on. The vacumme part is fantastic, I love how it moves and it's so light weight and flexible. The mop doesn't really mop up in dirt stains, spots, dried stains unless you sit it on top of the stain for a minute. Even still, it might not work. If this was improved I would love it! Needs to have a better scrubber.EDIT: I have had for 3 months and I had to reduce my rating. I clean mine after every use, run a water solution through it after use. It doesn't even suck up all the water like its supposed to and every time I shut off after use it leaves a muddy watery mess you have to clean up with a paper towel.... every. time.",One
keith,2.0 out of 5 stars,Typical Bissell,the United States,24-Jun-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I watched the infomercial ...numerous times, I thought this is just what I need..But just like every other time I have bought a Bissell, it sucked, or maybe it didnt suck..this thing has a hard time picking up a morsel of puppy food. As far as sucking up the barely sprayed water, it leaves streaks and you have to go over it more than once.I gave it 2 stars because at least the mop head gets wet and when all else fails you can just run it back and forth without the machine being turned on..It is loud, ear piercing loud..So after all these years of helping contribute to the Bissell family wealth, I'm CALLING IT QUITS..WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN.",One

I ""thought "" my floors were clean until I got my bissell today.The assembly was quick and simple, instructions were easy to navigate. Once I got it together I added water & cleaning solution, plugged it in and did the whole floor (approximately 1300 sqft) in about 15 - 20 minutes. I didn't do any prep work (sweep, swiffer, spot washing) I wanted to see if this lightweight little machine really could vacuum, wash & dry all at once.... It does it all! :DThe cleanup is very simple, every removable part is well labeled including the direction to move it in. I'll admit I was disgusted with how dirty my floors were. I will be washing my floors daily .... seriously.Update.... I washed my floors daily as stated above for the first week. As I got into the second week I noticed the water in the catch bin was much cleaner so I went down to washing every 3 days. The cleaning solution that comes with the vacuum was enough for the first few days of washing. It worked well enough but I decided to stick with simple and safe distilled white vinegar, I have also tried murphys oil soap but the floors felt a bit sticky (I may have used to much). I've become a bit of a pro with this mighty little machine that my total floor washing time is down to 15 minutes. I still give it 5 stars.",8

But don’t use in carpers of light color the brush makes things filthy. Have to go over the spots 3 or more times to get clean. I live in the south and dirty  sand is a huge issue.

Couldn't believe how much crud It picked up. I have a small dog who can't remember where to pee and two cats. This machine is a five star except that I don't see much point in using it for small jobs. The clean up of the machine is easy enough but it takes too long to make it efficient for a five minute cleaning job. The second time I used it I did the whole house, all tile, and it worked great.

Vyakti,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like an Electric Mop that collects instead of spreading around.,the United States,16-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It is an electric mop with added advantage of not spreading the stuff (dirt/ particles) around as everything gets collected in the water tank. Apart from that you shouldn't expect more from it. It is not a scrubber and won't clean the grouts.,
Gabrielle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny,the United States,24-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Worth every penny. I had this in my Amazon shopping cart for about a month before I finally purchased it. I vacuumed and mopped my floors daily at home with my toddler, thinking that everything was clean. First day of this arrived I went over my kitchen and living room floors and to my surprise the water in the dirty tank was completely black. Completely love the Bissell cross wave highly recommended super happy.",
Robert Altman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,17-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Highly recommend  especially  if you have a pet with no bladder control. I thought it was over priced until I used it. My dog has issues holding his  urine and his  bowels. I used the Cross Wave to clean up after him and to my surprise the ceramic tile floor I used it on came up so clean in the spot he messed in I had to clean the entire floor.,6
S. Manning,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,the United States,13-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have recently struggled to keep my elderly mother's house clean. Between her and all the cats it has been quite difficult, until today. The crosswave works amazingly. I was able to clean the bathroom, kitchen, and laundry room floors in less than an hour and they were filthy and covered with cat hair. The best purchase I think I have ever made. Easy assembly and use.",
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's so good that it's gross,the United States,16-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It sounds to good to be true, and honestly, I debated for a while about purchasing. With a houseful of kids, a dog, and plenty of dirt, this thing has earned a permanent place in our home. Good suction power. It leaves our real hardwood floors looking great. It's actually kind of gross how much stuff it picks up; as in, when I empty the dirty water reservoir I can't believe how gross our floors are. The cleaning power is top notch. I'd highly recommend this product.",

SandraG,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pain to clean after each use,the United States,22-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love that it scrubs and sweeps at the same time.  I dislike very much the clean up after.  I always have parts sitting on my counter waiting to dry and we live in the desert.  Can't imagine how people cope where there is high humidity.  It doesn't get close to the walls and there is no attachment to do this.  It's very difficult for me to remove the brush roller after each use.  The detergent dispenser and waste dispenser are easy to remove.  The filter is a bit difficult to remove and clean.  In retrospect I should have waited until someone makes a better machine.  I did get it at a good price from Amazon.,
Kory Floyd,2.0 out of 5 stars,Already regretting my purchase,the United States,1-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just used mine for the first time and I'm already regretting having bought it. Because of the rolling brush, I had hoped it would give my tile floors a nice deep clean. Instead, I feels like the rolling brush isn't even touching the floor. After I finished, I had to go back over my floor with my regular push mop to get it clean. The Bissell then leaked dirty water onto my floor after I turned it off, which I had to clean up with my regular mop again. I had hoped that this would do a better job than my regular mop, but so far it hasn't at all. I'm giving it two stars instead of one simply because the vacuum function works quite well.",
debobah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where has this been?,the United States,1-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Where has this been since we put down our porcelain tile???  Our tile is light colored and it has texture.  We tried Bona which works well on our hardwood floor, but the pad wasn't aggressive enough to clean the ""grooves"" and the grout.  I could actually clean the floor and afterward, take a damp paper towel and wipe the floor...it was still dirty.I have used this product once and the difference is amazing!  I swiped with a damp cloth after using the Crosswave and it's clean!  The rotating brush head with the bristles really do the job.  The Crosswave is worth every penny.  Do not let the price deter you.  Get yours now!",2
KM,5.0 out of 5 stars,I AM SO PLEASED,the United States,18-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I live in a small condo with tile floors and area rugs.  This is AS ADVERTISED.

I recommend it!,
Sindura,2.0 out of 5 stars,Has Good Suction But  Not Good With Stains,the United States,24-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It has very good suction and pulls the debris really well. However, I am not really impressed with how it does with actual stains. It doesn't clean the stain like a milk stain or food that got stuck to the floor. It just washes over it and I manually have to use my toe nail to scrape it off the floor and then vacuum over it. Lifting the cleaner will leave streaks of water and solution. Though we can bend it, it doesn't really clean under the sofa. It just leaves water and solution behind. It does collect a lot of dirt after every use. But I expected more especially because this is so expensive.",One
Devon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,the United States,10-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So I was very skeptical buying this product. It sounded too good to be true. It works great! It cut down the time to clean, and does a better job than a regular mop and broom. I threw a few curveballs at it today, and it dosent miss a thing! It has a few drawbacks though. The holding tank for your dirty water is small but easy enough to throw out your filth and pop right back in. It is also unable to get corners.Even with it's drawbacks, I am completely satisfied with how clean my floors are!Highly recommended!",One
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Buyers Regret,the United States,5-Sep-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've cleaned the filters and let them dry over 24hrs and made sure nothing was clogged and it still can't clean my carpet well. I understand that the rug setting isn't ment for thick carpet, but I have thin carpet and the hard floor setting leaves more of a mess than it attempts to clean. I use it once a week in my 28ft rv and it's not getting the job done. It's less frustrating to hand sweep my whole rig instead of using this product.",5
Sana,4.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work great on scraped floors.,the United States,22-Aug-17,,Verified Purchase,"If you have flat floors and have some patience and are not in a hurry, you should be happy with this product. It leaves the floors really clean and provides a good suction. However, the cleanliness might have a lot to do with the cleaning solution, so you might have to stick with the Bissell solutions and I have to use aboit 8 oz of it for a 1000 sqft floor area. I have scraped floors, meaning grooves and dips, it takes a while to work through and get it all. Works great on small area rugs, not at all on carpets, not for vacuuming, not for washing. The cord is also kind of short. Also, when cleaning against a floorboard, about an inch of space next to the wall doesn't get cleaned.",22
THarper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love!,the United States,5-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love this machine. I wish I knew it existed sooner. Saves time and gets everything so clean!

Stephen Larstanna,4.0 out of 5 stars,Its ok,the United States,27-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited about this vacuum, my wife loves it but I feel that the suction power is very limited.

raymond,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ehhh.great idea but not so great...,the United States,30-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The idea is great but ,it keeps getting clogged at the filter or inlet by roller brush.its either use it as a mop or vacuum because it makes a mess when you try to use it as both.

Ann F.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money,the United States,27-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,My title pretty much sums it up. Waste of money. Returned it after hours on the phone with customer service trouble shooting. It does not clean hard surfaces. My 20 year old Hoover machine that is barely hanging on to life cleans 100 times better. Luckily I was able to pull it out of the trash bin before garbage day to continue using until I find something that cleans.,
tammy pitts,5.0 out of 5 stars,For keeping up with day to day cleaning this machine is for you,the United States,9-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I believe anytime you start using a new product it takes a couple time to truely figure out what works best for you.  I read all the reviews and bought this machine despite some not so hot reviews.  Once you realize you need to use it backwards something along the lines as a rug scrubber.  For your deep cleaning days this is not the machine for you as it misses about a half inch from the walls.  You also want to use the cleaning base  Read the instructions and follow it.  It makes this machine truely amazing.  In conclusion for your day to day cleaning this machine rocks it,One
Laura M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!,the United States,30-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I purchased this product because I really wanted something to really clean my floors since we have a newborn that will soon be crawling. I was tired of using Swiffer (the baby is very sensitive to smells too) and I was done with the old mop and bucket. I used this and I fell in love with it. My floors had never been so clean. I could not believe how dirty our floor was this whole time. It was totally worth the money and I would repurchase it again if I had too. My tiles finally look white and I feel comfortable walking in white socks.,
Rosie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for hardwood, depends on the area rug.",the United States,7-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The vacuum on this is great. It does get smelly real fast so cleaning it every time to every other use is a must. It can be tedious but it beats having to sweep then mop then waiting to dry and making sure the dog/kid/ spouse don't step on the newly cleaned wet floor. Issue is the area rug, it seems to have the same suction therefore I have issues with the suction being to aggressive and pulling the rug fibers, where I have to manhandle the vacuum or else it'll get caught and Auto shut off.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst, most expensive, vacuum I’ve ever had.",the United States,8-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I never leave reviews for products I buy, but this thing is so terrible I felt like I needed to. If you have pets don’t even consider buying the crosswave. All it does is push hair and dirt around on the floor when using the vacuum function, and the wet “mop” function leaves streaks of mud and wet hair everywhere. It honestly makes more of a mess then it cleans. I know the crosswave is not exactly marketed as a pet cleanup tool, but for what it costed I expected it to at least vacuum a little. Very disappointing, and a complete waste of money.",
PS,4.0 out of 5 stars,My second one!,the United States,17-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Well I like this cleaner. But it really doesn't last too long. I bought one less then three years ago, and it just died. So I bought another one, I hope it last's longer. I don't have any dogs, I just like the way it works. I can't use the brush it comes with, it takes the grout out of my tile!",
AshleyM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Winter storm= saves the day!,the United States,22-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,During the winter storm I took in some family and their 3 GSD and they left hair everywhere and tracked mud in for 3 days. It took me an hour but I was able to vacuum and mop my kitchen/dining room/ living room well enough to walk barefoot without wanting to immediately put on shoes! The vacuum needed a deep clean after but it did a good job overall. I recommend dumping the dirty water immediately after a deep clean like that or it will smell horrible and it will make you want to throw up. I wish it had attachments for the corners and couches but I'll keep my old vacuum for it for now.,
samantha,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,19-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I honestly don’t find this does that good of a job.

Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just another piece of JUNK made in China I thought the Bissell name was a good product. Well I guess its back to Hoover,the United States,12-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've had this floor cleaner for 1 yr. Time for a review. I bought this to replace a hoover, which I have  had for 7 yrs. This unit cleaned my tile floors fantastically. Then after 1yr. it broke. So I used it every two weeks. A total of 24 times, then it broke and won't start.  You must physically unplug it and re plug it in to run for 10 seconds then stops.  Ok I did some further investigation. There is a secondary motor that spins the roller and it was not spinning consistently. Which caused the whole unit to shut down. One of my dogs has very fine hair and it got in between the sprocket and the shaft not the roller itself. That I clean every use. Once I cleaned that with a razor knife everything was fine. So I apologize to Bissell for all the bad things I said.",One

Suction power is excellent, and the water was soooooo dirty. My normal microfiber mop was obviously just pushing the dirty water around. Also, I don't get a workout now when mopping my floors. Just slowly guide it around and empty the dirty water as you go. You won't regret buying this.",One

Roni J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was skeptical but....,the United States,11-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for our house in Mexico.  Being a complete tile house with kids, I was skeptical of is working abilities. My kids no longer fight over not doing their chores, but fight on who's turn it is to mop. Tile floors are always clean.  Only draw back is I can't do stairs easily, I still have to use my mop.",
P. HAYNES,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for day to day cleaning,the United States,17-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It works well. My floors tend to get pretty dirty because I have dogs and I’m working with little grass because we recent built our house. I find that I have to take the roller out and clean it in between rooms or else it starts leaving streaks from a dirty roller. Overall I’m happy with it. Makes day to day cleaning much easier but doesn’t replace a good vacuum and mop.,

The crosswave does not spray solution anymore, the clean water tank is leaking, and dirty water is leaking out the back. Mind you, this was after using it about a week ago with no issues. It literally just...stopped working. As someone else said, buyer beware. Great while it works, but for $200+, I got less than a year of use out of it.",One

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s worth it!,the United States,4-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this product! I have a husky and it’s great for pet hair!! My dogs hair is so lightweight that sometimes you cannot sweep up all the hair. This vacuum gets it all! I wish it had a little more suction power. Besides that the only thing that sucks is having to dig the hair out from the dirty water. It should separate the two or have a drain. Regardless i love it! Worth the buy!,One

It’s insanely streaky. The whole brush in general is just not great. It leaves about an inch and a half gap between the wall and where the suction ends. It’s so frustrating!! I clean the bin, brush, and filter after every use, yet after the first use it SMELLED HORRIBLE when in use!! Like mildew. Even though I dried everything out as instructed.

Bissell is garbage!!!,the United States,13-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,As a previous reviewer said- this is an incredible waste of money and complete garbage. Worked fine for about 3 months then wheel bearings seized up rendering it completely useless. Figured a $300 vacuum would waste longer than 3 months. After spending an hour taking out 20 tiny screws to access the belt and motor realized it was broken and not designed to be fixed 😂 F this vacuum and F this company. Junk and they know it.

Now, if you have a toddler as I do, more power will be needed. Its also kinda noisy so i was not able to use it while the baby was asleep (which is when i have to do everything).

I honestly think my cross wave was used before, when it was delivered it had dirt in it and looked like it’s been used.

Cre8ive One,1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete waste of time a Swiffer wet jet works better. Hoover Floormate so much better!,the United States,7-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Horrible.  First off you better vaccum your floors with something else. Then mop then use this feather duster  for a ...exercise.  I took a chance on trying the Bissel crosswave after so much hype and sad to say my 15 year old Hoover floormate will clean circles around this engineering disaster. it's also has several areas you cant clean so guess what it's going back!!!,
Kelly,4.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded my expectations!,the United States,1-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had low expectations of this product. I thought my floors were just a little dirty as this is a new construction home that’s constantly cleaned.. well I was wrong! This vacuum/mop combo made the floors look amazing and I was shocked at what I cleaned out of the dirty canister!  Only setback is it doesn’t get into tight places but, I’m okay with doing those few areas by hand! This is a keeper!",One
Carlie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my CrossWave,the United States,30-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I can't do hands and knees scrubbing like I used to, but I still want clean floors.  I use this on tile and vinyl flooring.  I was surprised at how dirty the return water was since my housekeeper just cleaned (using a wet swiffer).  I used the sample cleaner that came with the Crosswave. There is no sticky residue left on the floor after it dries and the floor dries quickly.  No streaking.  I promptly bought more.  The cleaner is lightweight, easy to fill, empty and maneuver.  Easy to clean it afterwards too.  It is so easy to use I get it out for quick cleanups after spills or pets.  I have already recommended this to my friends.",
KellyHH,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST. THING. EVER.,the United States,20-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If your on the fence, buy this now! I have a VERY large all time home and a bad back. I used to use my shark vacuum with floor tool for the dirt and debri and then follow up with my Hoover floormate for my floor cleaning. It worked okay but my back would KILL me afterward. This machine eliminates one step and gets it cleaner than my other two machines ever did before! Yes, there is some machine maintainance and clean up that has to be done after each use but well worth it for the time and back ache it saves me!",2
Brit C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this! If you have hard floors buy it !,the United States,2-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Amazing ! I don’t know if I have ever been this excited about a vacuum or mop before. Seeing the dirty water tank shows how much work it is doing to clean the floor . Easy to use and put together. Quick to start using from unboxing,

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t pick up bigger food particles.,the United States,1-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this floor cleaner. I have two toddlers who make lots of messes so I use this vacuum just about every day. Most of my home has hardwood floors so this vacuum is perfect and I love that I can use it on my living room rug as well. The only reason I can’t give this all 5 stars is because it’s doesn’t pick up any bigger items. I still have to get out my stick vacuum first to clean up around the table after toddlers have eaten cereal or goldfish crackers to get all of that stuff up because this one is definitely wont get it. But the fact that I can (mostly) vacuum and wash my floors in one step is just awesome and makes my busy life just a little bit easier.,
A. Boleyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, I Recommend This",the United States,9-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Okay, to be fair I just got it yesterday so all I can give are my first impressions. So far I love it! I don't think my laminate floors have been this clean, ever. I am disabled with limited use of my arm/shoulder and this was painless for me compared to using a mop. This takes a lot less energy and and does a much better job than a mop. My most dreaded chore just became a whole lot easier with better results.",2
Janet,5.0 out of 5 stars,No more mop and broom,the United States,22-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I held off getting one between the price and some say the suction was poor. Now I'm wishing I had got it before now. The suction is good. I use both the floor and rug mode. When I switch to do the cat stand it has such a high suction it's almost hard to move. One thing I find to help suction is clean it after you use it. The reason I got one is because I hate having a mop , which smells if you don't bleach it out. I mop everyday 2 or 3 times.",One
Samantha,1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst vacuum I ever had,the United States,21-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The worst vacuum I ever had. Brush window so overadvertised broke on the first day , simply cracked when going under the bed. Forget using it for both vacuum and suction if you have a pet. It's just not strong enough. Supposed to be delivered with prime, it took almost a week. Worst purchase I ever made on Amazon and I shop almost every day for past 11 years.",3
Susan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing power.,the United States,3-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the most amazing thing I have ever bought. We have an indoor goose and cleanup has never been easier. The suction is better than my Dyson, cleanup is a complete breeze. No giant holding tanks of dirty water to pour out and scour in the tub. Saves me SO much time, effort, sweeping, vacuuming then swiffering. This is a one and done and I couldn’t be happier. Best thing I have ever spent my money on!",One
Di's netbook,2.0 out of 5 stars,So sorry I purchased this. Really does not do ...,the United States,24-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So sorry I purchased this. Really does not do the job. A nuisance to clean after each use and doesn't get in corners. I have to re clean floors afterwards.Really is not worth the pricey tag. Very disappointing because I thought cleaning my floors would be easier. Instead this makes it harder.also VERY DIFFICULT TO CLEAN. Instructions say clean after each use, which I do, but it takes me more time to clean than it does to do my floors!",One
Drew Seeley,4.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient and quick,the United States,24-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"For a quick clean, this has been wonderful!! Living in the country, my floor is constantly dirty. To vacuum and surface mop at the same time is fabulous (my entire downstairs takes half a tank and about 10 minutes). Also, it is easy to clean and store. With 4 kids I have a lot of stuck on spots, which I still have to scrub or scrape by hand.",One
Cynthia G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy I finally made the purchase!,the United States,10-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Wow, wished I had this year's ago.  I have dogs and cats with hardwood floors.  My Crosswave is always ready to go.  I also purchased the hardwood and rug brushes.  They all work well.  Arrived quickly and in good packaging.  Easy to set up and use.So, I have had and used my Crosswave for a while now.  Just finished washing my hardwood upstairs and stained concrete downstairs.  This machine still works well and the three brushes have also held up.  Still very happy with this purchase!",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine,the United States,15-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this machine!!! I have had it for a month now and absolutely LOVE IT!!! Great for everyday use and really saves the back ache of traditional sweeping and mopping. I only wish it either got right up against the walls for the mopping part or that it had an arm tool to get along the wall. That is the only downside I have seen with this machine so far. That’s why I overall only give it 4 stars because you do have to sweep the debris away from the wall and then separately clean about 1/4 inch near the wall.,One
Paula R,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great idea, some flaws in execution",the United States,2-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The vacuum works well enough to suck up dog hair but you need to make multiple passes to clean anything. Takes a lot longer to mop because I have to keep passing over the same spot to get it clean. Also have only had the vacuum a few months and where the roller clips in is broken making it hard to keep the roller in while cleaning.,
Mando,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase,the United States,9-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have been using this product for a few months now. I love it.

Gary Szostak,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THIS MACHINE,the United States,27-Aug-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I HAVE USED THE CROSSWISE FOR 2 MONTHS NOW AND LOVE IT. IT IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN AND IT PICKS UP EVERYTHING NO SWEEPING BEFORE HAND. WASHES AND  DRYS VERY NICE WITH NO STREAKS IF YOU USE THE CLEANING SOLUTION BY BISSELL.

Yuki Reed,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this vacuum,the United States,7-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this vacuum! I have a back issues for a very long time and couldn’t cleaning house for a years. My cleaning lady retired this month and I need it to something done, I saw tv commercial about bissell cross wave vacuum I thought give it a try and it was so much easier and light weight I didn’t get hurt from vacuuming. I recommend everyone to try this you will falling in love with it.",3
CindyS CA,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and versatile.,the United States,17-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My floors definitely feel cleaner, after using this product. A bit difficult to decipher when to pump more soap and when to just keep gliding across floors. I used it on both luxury vinyl planks and travertine floors.",
Fallon Walters,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money!,the United States,20-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I don’t feel this cleans your floor well at all. All it does is puts water on the floor and then sucks it up partially. If you need to scrub your floors to get something off you better get a sponge and your hand. You have to dismantle the entire machine each time your done to clean the parts. I assumed I would be getting a good floor scrubbing each time I used but it doesn’t. Thankfully my floors stay clean for the most part and don’t require much but it would be nice to have a machine that could do it when I wanted it too. Waste of big bucks! I liked my steamer much better. Oh to top it off it doesn’t clean close to the edges. The vacuum cleaner on it is good though.,2
Tamisha,5.0 out of 5 stars,A true time saver.,the United States,25-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Cleanup time has been chopped dramatically. I took the advice of my sister whose had the Crosswave for a few years now and ohh boy, it's sweet. I couldn't resist sweeping or using my Dyson Animal prior to running the Bissell the first few times. Man I tell you, I think I'm in love! So far, this is a great investment.",
C. Powell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,9-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love this product. I am handicapped and this product glides over my floors. My daughter videoed herself using it and sent it to her friends highly recommending it to them. At least one is going to get one for herself. Our mops are put away  now, this does a  much better job at cleaning. We had mopped the floors with our old mop  and went back over the floor. We couldn't believe how much cleaner the floor was using the Crosswave. This is one of the best products I have ever owned.",
jane doe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"like it a lot, but there are drawbacks",the United States,25-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Very effective, walking barefoot feels so good. Got to use it right away when my cat missed his box. Easy to maneuver. I'm happy with the results.cons: it's VERY loud, it's heavy, and can't get flush to the wall (~1"").",
Ernie,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is truly a blessing,the United States,21-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We use this CrossWave multi surface floor cleaner to keep our laminate floors looking great as it restores the shine to them so they look as they had just been installed, unit is equally good on vinyl and tile. I haven't used on rugs so I can't give you comments on them. We are very satisfied with this machine as it took a long boring job and made it a quick easy process, eliminating the need to go over the floor to remove the streaks left from the prior method we used.",
Hannah Bryant,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good!,the United States,27-Nov-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this! I've been wanting a Crosswave for so long now. I have two big dogs, so doing the floors can become quite the chore. I love that this product takes a step (sweeping) out of my cleaning routine. Less of a mess than regular mopping, and it's nice to know that you're never putting dirty water back on your floor. I also used this on an area rug of mine and was extremely impressed by the results.",One

Do not buy this if you want it to serve as a vacuum. Waste of money,
K. Black,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!!,the United States,8-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely am in love with this product. I used to dread cleaning my floors, but when you see the difference it is amazing. The first time I did it 3 times to really get it clean.  It was so easy to use, I kept doing it over and over to get all of the dirt out of the tiny divers in my marble floor. Now I do it once a week. It is light weight and has great power. You have to get this is you have flooring!",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great getting up per hair!,the United States,1-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Man the muddy water And pet hair that is in the container after using the Crosswave is amazing!

Jarvis Peacock,5.0 out of 5 stars,My floor have never been so clean,the United States,2-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Wow love this product my entire first floor is hardwood... sweeping and moping takes along time. I used this the first day i got it and when i walked on the floor you could just tell its clean i love that feeling im tossing the broom and mop lol,
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Depending on what you are doing, it works very well.",the United States,13-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This works very well on tile and does a lot of floor before needing a refill.  You get more out of it if you use the right technique like going over the cleaned area again without dispensing any liquid.  I use half the cleaning solution that it calls for. That way I notice zero film from the solution.  You can even use less than I do, but it won’t clean as well.  Overall, this does beat using my shop’s mop and bucket.  However, the machine must be cleaned right after each use.  That takes extra time.  Well, same with mop but mop is faster.",
Lisa H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,23-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have dark hardwood floors and light tile in my house that shows EVERYTHING.  I have to vacuum at least daily and mop at least every other day to keep it clean. This I can do every other day and half the time and I don’t mind it at all. It makes my floors look amazing. Yes you do have to clean it after every use but it only takes a couple minutes and it keeps your vacuum looking brand new.,
Emma Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing clean!,the United States,8-Aug-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Cleans all floor surfaces very well! You’ll be shocked how dirty your floors actually are if you’re like me and very meticulous when it comes to cleaning. Having to remove the brush roll is annoying and seems unnecessary after each time. But the brush roll cleaning tray that comes with is very nice so you don’t have to handle it while it’s grimy! I’ve used it on sealed hardwood, vinyl, tile, and rugs. It cleans all surfaces extremely well, especially with a messy toddler and a cat!",

Boomshakamama,1.0 out of 5 stars,Huge waste of money!,the United States,18-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the worst vacuum I’ve ever had. The description and video would make you think otherwise but after the first use it would hardly pick up a bead. There is so much maintenance after each use that time and effort required to use it weekly, heck daily is literally impossible!!! I have three small kids and what was meant to be a lightweight easy helpful vacuum is now my biggest waste of money.",
Dieanna Estes,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the $$,the United States,10-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I honestly don’t like it and and stuck with it because I can’t return it now. I would rather sweep and use a spin mop. This has too many departments that need to be cleaned out at least every other time. It’s more difficult to maintain than sweeping a mess up imo. Not worth the $$.,
B. Wooten,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Cleans pretty well, but not up close to baseboards",the United States,6-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’ve used it twice so far and it Seemed like it cleans pretty well, but don’t trust it to stand up on its own, it’s not sturdy and mine fell over and broke the little thing that you wrap your cord around on the first use. There’s no way to fix that. Ugh.Also it doesn’t mop up close to the baseboards. So now I have to go back with a mop or rag  if I want to get my floors cleaned all the way to the edge.",
Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,the United States,13-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This hard floor cleaner has been an essential member of our family. With having kids and no dog to clean up after meals, it keeps our floors clean and mopped without bending over and doing the hard work!",
PSR,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great,the United States,21-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is great! It's a vacuum and mop together which is exactly what we needed for our hardwood floors that were covered in dog hair. The vacuum pulls up materials and the mop part cleans the floors. It also doesn't leave the floors streaked which is wonderful.,
butch,3.0 out of 5 stars,not quite what i expected,the United States,27-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,it doesn't clean rugs as well as i would like but for quick pickups its easy this would be perfect if the head was smaller for those areas around toilets and bathroom sinks its like 2 inches too big to fit between wall and sink or toilet also roller brush  doesn't reach out to washboard edge to clean roller mounts need to be moved to inside ends of roller so the brush reaches the edges of floor,
Lifan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Innovation,the United States,12-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Very easy to use. It can suck and mop at the same time, really making cleaning an easy job to do. I think everyone should buy one to save your time, really...Just one thing, the power line is a bit disturbing. It would be great if the machine can automatically take it back when it's too long. Otherwise, this is a perfect machine. Love it!",

Thankfully I have vinyl ""wood"" plank floors but this vacuum has made my life so easy.  When I find a puddle I just get the bissell out and it cleans it right up! No paper towels to soak up the mess I just vacuum and clean it up. Now since it is urine and I pretty much use this 10 times a day I only empty the tank at night. I always put a half of a cup of vinegar in the bottom to neutralize the odors.  Of course it works as far as cleaning it is a wonder. If the appliance quit on me today I would order a new one immediately.",One

Clyde Layton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning device,the United States,9-Feb-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant to buy this due to some reviews. However I took the chance. It works great. Cleans easy and fast. Does not leave streaks. The only con I could find is it limited on how close to the wall, cabinets, etc can get. But it does get all the debris.I have laminate floors with groves in them. The groves are all cleaned out. The second time I used this the water was a lot cleaner and I thought my floors were clean before. However I know they are now.I would recommend this to anyone.",

Luke J. Lovell,1.0 out of 5 stars,This made my tile look WORSE,the United States,10-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The rubber slider on the bottom (behind the roller) just leaves black marks on your floors and pushes everything around. Every pull creates a black line that the vacuum cannot collect, and will result in more black lines if you try. I imagine it would do the same on most hard floors. I wish I could return it, but now I'm only RETURNING to a traditional mop... (haha, get it). 1/10",
stephanie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Blows hair instead of sucking up,the United States,15-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Not a huge fan of this vacuum.

Lismary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good product. Just buy especially if you have dogs.,the United States,22-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I saw this product on clean tik tok and I had to buy it. I have 2 dogs and it did a great job picking up dog hair.  I would recommend to use the hard floors setting to pick up the dog hair before using the wet setting. Cleaned my floor really well.  Be patient and make sure you keep up with it after each use.,
Jo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,the United States,16-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love cleaning with this thing. A word of advice--DO clean it/ rinse it out after you are done and don't clean with it dirty. The smell is bad. Also, make sure to remove the filter before you do so it doesn't get wet. This one comes with two filters so you can quickly use one while cleaning the other. I use it several times a week.",
TMS6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as described,the United States,8-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have been searching for a couple of years for something that would clean my laminate floors so they look like new.

All I can say is what was in the chamber after cleaning our hardwood floors and area rugs was disgusting.  🤢Shocked at how much dirt was taken up and I vacuum and wash floors almost weekly.  Hardwood floors I’m not sure as clean as when I wash on my hands and knees but this was so much easier.  Would recommend for anyone with pets or family members with long hair!,
Linda,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not User Friendly,the United States,29-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Not as light as I hoped.  If your arthritic its not user friendly. Also very tedious to clean after using.  Does the job but still disappointed. Probably was better off using two step method.,
tracey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaner,the United States,18-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this cleaner. I’m a hairstylist and it does a great job on my floors. It light weight and easy to use. It is easy to clean the machine afterwords. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes clean floors!,
Ashley Fox,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this machine!,the United States,1-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’ve had this a few weeks and I absolutely love it. I love how small it is, it takes up barely any room. It’s very easy to clean, which I feel like I’ve never been able to accomplish in my past vacuums. I also love that it’s multipurpose and can do tile to carpet + the multi-surface solution smells great! If you have a huge house, probably not for you, but it works amazing on my 2 bedroom, 2 bath 💙",
ASRN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this vac mop!,the United States,30-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Only regret is not getting it sooner. Bought mainly for hardwood floors, I didn’t think it would so that well on area rugs but I love it for both! Always surprised at how much cleaner floors feel.",
Brooklyn Jones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaked water everywhere & made a bigger mess than where I started,the United States,26-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this product. But, as soon as I used it the first time, water leaked everywhere & it smeared watery dirt all over my floor. It took me longer to clean up the mess it made than it would have for me to clean the floors by hand. Very disappointing. Especially for the price. Sent back immediately.",
Ana,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hate it!,the United States,24-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this because I thought it was going to do a good job of cleaning my floors at the same time as I vacuumed. It does not, it just leaves it sloshy and wet, the sponge is not nearly close enough to apply any sort of pressure to wash properly or remove excess moisture.I wanted to buy a Shark to steam. I thought this was a good tow in one but I hate it so much. I wish I could get my money back.",One
Anjela,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mostly hardwood floors in my house.,the United States,30-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Easy to use, works great. It replaces my regular vacuum cleaner, broom and steamer. I have a large house that is all hardwood floors. I do not use this on bedroom carpet but I do use it on my area rugs. I do wish you had essential oil cleaners that is used in the machine. You can use just water or buy Bissel products but I really don't like the fabreeze smells. But that really is a small complaint.  Easy to clean but be prepares our dirt is gross, it amazed me how much dirt it got up. Love it.",
Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,26-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This multi surface cleaner is phenomenal! I absolutely LOVE it!

Kathleen Hamrick,5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT!!!,the United States,29-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Where has this cleaner ALL MY LIFE!1800 sf of tile and this machine has cut the work of cleaning in half with EXCELLENT results. 2 Border Collies and Colorado wet spring wasn’t a problem for this machine. I would give a 10 rating if an option.,
Paul,4.0 out of 5 stars,This would be much better if the brush bristles were longer,the United States,17-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This works ok, though don't expect it to get in-between cracks very well. I have to go over tile, continually pressing the spray button, about 3 times for the grout lines to even look damp. This would be much better if the brush bristles were longer. Not much liquid comes out so don't expect great cleaning results with a single pass, and as others have mentioned, the vacuum suction is not great so you'll have to pass over an area again without using the spray.",One
kimberley houston,5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite thing!!!,the United States,4-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I can’t say enough great things about this. I have all hardwood and tile in my 3 pet home with many area rugs.  Gets up hair of all types and makes keeping a spotless floor super easy! No messy mop bucket and mop to drag around. I have recommended this to many purchasers who have kids and pets. They have all been pleased,One
Woot woot,5.0 out of 5 stars,Woot woot,the United States,20-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love my crosswave, I’ve recently moved into a home with all vinyl wood flooring and rugs and the crosswave works perfect for both. That’s the water after the first time using the crosswave, mind you I only have 1 cat and my boyfriend and I in the house. Didn’t realize my floors were THAT dirty, and to think I was laying on them before I bought my crosswave. Only complaint I would have is that it’s cleanup after using is similar to a carpet cleaner, need to scrub the brush out and rinse the vacuum itself. I don’t use it for small messes for that reason, it takes some time to clean up after use. Perfect to use on a day I’m deep cleaning though!!!",
AlannaM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cute but baggy,the United States,21-May-21,CrossWave + Multi-Surface,Verified Purchase,Best purchase everrr. Constantly using this. However doesn't get as close to the edge as I'd like,One
Elizabeth Castorena,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Birthday Gift to Myself.,the United States,13-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I purchased this for a self birthday gift and totally love it.  Leaves my floors super clean feel it when I walk around barefoot.  Some people put that it leaves a residue I fix it by going over my floors first with the cleaning solution then I go over my floors again with just water.  I will never go back to using a regular mop.,
Gregg R Owens,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Cleaner !!!,the United States,5-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This thing is amazing.PRO's...- Easy to assemble and use- Does a great job on area rugs- Easy to take apart and put back together- Picks up dog hair like no other machine we have usedCON's...- Kind of heavy- Hard to push/pull on carpet (but worth it)- With 2 dogs we need to empty and clean the dirty container oftenOverall well worth the money. Even after vacuuming this machine gets a lot moreout of carpet.,
Bear horbacz,5.0 out of 5 stars,All I can say is WOW!!,the United States,4-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’m not normally one to write reviews, but all I can about this all-in-one cleaner is WOW!!I could not wait to pull this out of the box to test it out and it did not disappoint!!I recently purchased a home with hardwood and carpet and needed a cleaner that could tackle both. This machine was so easy to use and seamlessly went from hardwood to carpet with no issues! I could not believe how much dirt and hair the all-in-one cleaner picked up. With 3 kids, this product is a no brainer! Even cleaning the machine was so easy.",
Marla B,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't pull all of the water back up so your floors stay wet.....,the United States,6-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"After having this vacuum for several months and giving it my best effort to love it, I'm left feeling very disappointed. I bought this for my small office with hopes that I could vacuum and mop with one piece of equipment. The few few tries I added up to being a rookie and not knowing how to properly use it. Now, after several months of using it I'm confident that this mop just isn't good at what it's supposed to be good at. I'm left with dirty water on my floors that I then have to go back over with a swiffer mop just to have clean floors. And to make matters even better, I have missed my chance to return it. Oh well. Lesson learned.",One
Victoria L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must buy!!,the United States,4-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"My friend had recommended this to me, but I was hesitant to purchase since I wasn’t a fan of it not being cordless. We’ve been doing baby led weaning and I was so tired of cleaning up the mess by hand that I finally purchased this. Sooooo glad I did. This is the BEST.",
bgchristianson,5.0 out of 5 stars,So Good,the United States,3-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I gave this to my son and his wife after they replaced all the carpet in their home with hard surface flooring. They love how this makes it so easy and quick to keep their new floors looking beautiful.,
Luis A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best in this category.,the United States,22-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a great product for general cleaning, specially for quick pick up of small spills. i use it all the time to pick up cat hair and any accident they might have done. It draws in all particles including hair and does not get caught in the spinning brush like the Hoover model. Clean up is easy and never any issues operating. Although it would be great if the waste container was a little bigger. I have larger commercial grade machines but for smaller, quick applications you can't beat this machine. Very reliable and a great price.",
J-noxious,1.0 out of 5 stars,Trash!!!,the United States,27-Nov-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Trash!! Leaves behind streaks.  Horrible suction.  Doest cover the edges, appropriately 1inch from the front of the vac and 1.5 inches from the side vac.  Heavy and alot of parts to clean.",2
Niessa,5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT little cleaning machine,the United States,11-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"OMG!!!!! Should'a bought this a long time ago.  Super easy to use, does a fantastic job and simple to clean up the unit.  Just a note - it does not get all the way up to the wall.  There's about a 1/4 - 1/2 inch it just can't reach but still such an awesome product.  I can't mop anymore do to disabilities and this makes life so much easier and does an excellent job cleaning up from grandbabies and large indoor/outdoor dogs.",One
Bruce M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as described,the United States,15-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This cleaner worked perfectly the first time. The roller base could have been a bit wider especially for the wide open hard floor areas. The cord did get in the way but was manageable. I didn't care for the clean up.,One
Janell R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy it, especially if you have dogs!",the United States,20-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a 2 yr. old silver lab and a 5 year old lab/border collie mix.  We have a dog door for them that enters the house onto a dining room, galley kitchen and kitchen nook with a Pergo floor.  While I have throw rugs scattered around the footprints and mud (springtime in Wyoming) it was impossible to keep up with it.  I do use a Dyson stick to pick up the majority of dog hair and loose dirt before I use the CrossWave.  That takes about 5 minutes.  Then I run the CrossWave and it washes the floor and picks up the rest of the dirt and hair.  About 8 minutes.  The kicker is how easy it is to clean when you are done.  This has never been one of my strong suits!  All the cleanable parts are accessed from the top of the machine with no muss or fuss.",4
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gave for a Gift to my Kids and their spouses and they are in love!,the United States,1-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Both of my kids have dogs.

Cassie,3.0 out of 5 stars,burning smell after a few months,the United States,8-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The vaccuum itself works well for me -- the plastic piece that collects dirty water had to be replaced once, i tried to wash it with hot water and it ended up warping and no longer fit. I learned my lesson and now just let it be -- however it's warped again somehow. I was able to press it into place with a little more effort, but then smelled a strong burning smell last time i tried to run the vacccuum!!This just doesn't seem to be as long lasting as the price should justify.",One
Nana Janet.  The Queen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow, slow, slow!",the United States,30-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The product works in that it dispenses cleaning solution and suctions it up.  However it dispenses the cleaning solution so slowly that I have to stay in the same spot for minutes waiting for enough solution to be dispensed to effectively clean my floor. When using this machine it takes me twice as long to clean my floor as it usually takes me. I’ll be returning it as soon as I can pack it up.,One
Abby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing - worth the money!,the United States,18-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"SO THRILLED! We have one rambunctious pitbull and two pitbull cousins so when they come over, RIP to my floors. This little machine makes mopping an absolute pleasure instead of a chore.After using, we fully dismantle so everything dries out. No issues several months later. Our floor hasn’t been so clean since we moved in.",

Stuart R Boyd,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth every penny,the United States,22-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really like this a whole lot.  Way better than the Hoover.  The dry vac on my rugs picks up where my central vac leaves off.  With 3 cats there's much fuzzy stuff and it's nice to see the results.  Easy to clean, to switch functions etc.  Wish the cord were half again as long.  5 stars would say I love it, and I don't LOVE inanimate things!",2
LGWalsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best combo vacuum for the cleanest floors!,the United States,23-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This has to be one of the best inventions ever! I used it at one of my house cleaning jobs and immediately got one for myself. I raved about it so much that 3 of my friends already got it for themselves. I live in a sandy area and have two cats, I can't believe how much of the very fine sand it gets even AFTER using my Dyson.",
Melanie Duke,5.0 out of 5 stars,My floors have never felt better,the United States,10-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is a very easy to use product. The first time I used I had mopped my floor the day prior and thought they were clean. I was shocked how dirty the water was and just how much dog hair it picked up. Walking on the floor after they dried you could feel such a huge difference. I highly recommend this product,
Rachel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed and annoying to clean,the United States,15-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The vacuum itself is not impressive and not heavy duty. Also a pain to clean; you have to take apart and clean like 6 pieces each use or else the brush and tank will stink. I’d rather just use a good vacuum and an old school spinny mop.,
H. Fites,1.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t give complete review.,the United States,10-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"As my machine arrived with a missing part, the cap to the cleaner bottle, I really can’t tell you much. Budget an additional $20 for a replacement if you get the same.",
Alex Cantle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,24-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It does exactly what I need it to do. It’s sensitive to picking up any kind of wrapper pieces. They get stuck and clog the small holes and then you have to take it apart and unclog. But for the most part, I love this vacuum!",
happy1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent cleaner,the United States,8-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,My wife purchased this and it has sworn her off vacuum cleaners. It cleans rugs and hard wood floors with ease. Floor drives very fast due the little water that is left on the floor. You can tell how well it works by looking at the dirty water output. Really worth the money.,
Melissa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked like a charm,the United States,5-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I finally used this for the first time this weekend. My area rugs looked so good that I decided to do the rest of the house. Everything looks and smells great! My husband noticed it as soon as he walked in the house. I had to empty the waste container a few times during my cleaning. Once I finished, the final cleanup was easy. Hopefully it continues to work great.",
M. Wallets,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it,the United States,26-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I bought this for my son and his wife when they moved into their new apartment with hardwood floors. It sucked up all the Styrofoam and dirt from the floor and cleaned beautifully it’s a great machine,
amie lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Efficient,the United States,22-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We have two dogs who shed a lot and I debated on which product to purchase.  I chose this one because I just couldn't justify the difference in price between the CrossWave and the one specifically for pets.  I think the Crosswave does a good job.  It is relatively easy to clean after using.,
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Works great until it doesn't,the United States,9-Apr-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It works great until it doesn't.  I have only owned it 5 months, today it smelled like an electrical fire and stopped working.  We have had two other Bissell floor cleaners that stopped working, the first one was replaced and the second one we just threw away.  I'm not overly impressed with the durability of the floor cleaners but I do believe Bissell is a good company and they wI'll honor the warranty.",2

CK,1.0 out of 5 stars,Gets gunned up and smelly!,the United States,23-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’m so disappointed with this. First of all, it doesn’t work on my area rugs; it was fine for the hardwood. But the smell! I cleaned it as instructed and took out the roller to dry but the hose is filled with gunk I can’t get out and it’s making my floor smell horrible!!!",
Stan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,the United States,7-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Cleans very well.  Better than anything I have ever used.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life saver,the United States,14-May-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just got this Bissell Crosswave. I asked for it for Mother's Day. It was easy to set up, and I was able to start cleaning right away.  It is going to be a life saver and a huge time saver for me.  We just put in these gorgeous laminate floors through our whole downstairs and with 3 dogs,  and a toddler, and a dirt backyard it is hard to keep them clean. And to sweep and mop them was an all day job. And now I can clean them every day or as needed, and it's so easy!! I couldn't believe how much it sucked up, and all the dog hair it picked up.  I couldn't imagine life without this now. One of the best things we ever bought. Easy to clean all the parts too. The only thing I wish was that it was cordless.",
jennyk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Vacuum/mop!!,the United States,25-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this! I read a lot of reviews and decided to give it a try.

Anna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,the United States,12-Jun-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I've had this vacuum about 2 months. At first I was not sure of it as we have terrazzo floors and I have always vacuumed first then mopped. This thing really works and you can see that by the water you dump. We have 3 dogs too and we just put down a decorative rug last week and what it vacuum and cleaned was amazing. Very easy to clean to just a few clicks and its apart not hard and you don't need muscle. Recommend,One

Gail B. Lloyd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gets the job done!,the United States,6-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,You still have to pre-mop edges and under cabinets. The Crosswave housing won't fit under cabinetry.  To avoid streaking your pathways have to overlap.  Other than that it works great!!,
Lis,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor design of dirt intake, must empty constantly",the United States,4-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"As my headline mentions, the design of the area where the dirt comes in is awful. Its a slender tube with no easy dispersal, it gets clogged CONSTANTLY. I have to empty it every 10 minutes, before the chamber is even remotely full, otherwise loose all suction.

Frances Rabby,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not cordless but still great,the United States,15-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was unable at this time to afford the cordless one but I was not dissappointed with this one. Sure it has a cord and it doesn't clean it's self but it still works just as well. For me, having an all in one is great! Before I'd have to vacuum then mop. I am not a spring chicken but it saves by doing both chores at once. Cleaning it after I have finished takes maybe 5 minutes tops! It is really easy to breakdown. Thanks for saving my back and making my life a little easier!",
Adellas_Thorn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daycare Owner Says YES,the United States,22-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have a lot of hardwood, and a couple rugs.

I could do everything i needed to with one product giving me more down time. Well today i had to swipe my rug ( the only carpet in the house!) If you have small children especially young ones dont get it. It wont pick crumbs up on rug mode and when using it on hardwood you cant get close to the wall. I still have to swipe and mop. I've had it about a month and i absolutely hate it.,

I was not expecting it to actually live up to the hype I watched a lot of videos on YouTube. I couldn't believe it would tackle an entire raw egg but, it can.

Philip S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice little machine,the United States,3-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a really nice wet vac. It’s light, easy to maneuver, and does a decent job cleaning my laminate floors.I like that it leaves very little moisture on the floors, especially if you go over them a second time without the spray. It’s also easy to fill the water container, change out the dirty water and remove the brush for cleaning and drying. The only gripe I have is that you have to remove the dirty water after the container is only about a third full.",

I have been struggling to clean my laminate floors but this has done the trick! The vacuum function alongside the mopping is great.

Dodger,4.0 out of 5 stars,This helped us in a grout cleaning project,the United States,10-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this floor cleaner to help us get through a big grout cleaning project and I’m glad I did. It’s a good scrubber and vacuum in one. I think we’ll be getting a lot of use from it once our floor project is finished.

Bulletbob777,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,the United States,7-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is my second Crosswave.  This device is awesome, especially if you have pets.  You do have to clean it after each use and make sure you pay attention to the filter (it’s the reason I’m on my second Crosswave).  Also, buy a second roller brush to use while the first roller is drying after being cleaned.",
Jane J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Set up was easy, turned it on",the United States,21-Jun-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Bought this in December.  Just took it out of the box to use it for the first time as I was moving in to my small new home and just recently got everything organized.  I watched the Bissell video on how to set it up and use it.  Set up was easy, turned it on, it dispensed water just fine, bu absolutely no suction.  Contacted Bissell  and we did all the steps to trouble shoot it.  They have determined that the machine is defective.  They told me to contact Amazon.  This is an expensive machine.  I am very upset.Here is an update.  Amazon replaced the defective unit in a very fast manner.  I have had ample opportunity to use the new one on both my floors and carpet.  I am so impressed.  This cleaned a very dirty floor and carpet without any effort and dried to almost completely dry.  The manufactured flooring was dry, and the carpeting was just slightly damp.  The best part was that all were immaculately cleaned with very little effort.The machine is lightweight, No heavy huge piece of machinery to hide somewhere.  It actually makes cleaning my floors a cinch.  Broken eggs are picked up in an instant, shell and all.  I love it and highly recommend this product.",6
l minor,4.0 out of 5 stars,It gets the job done.,the United States,12-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,For the price it works great. But I didn’t give it 5 stars because you really have make sure you keep it clean. You must wipe it down after each use and have extra filters and rollers available to make sure everything is clean smelling. My next one will be the self cleaning one.,

Kelly T19,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Hoover Floormate!,the United States,28-Mar-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The motor in my Hoover Floormate just burned out.  Not sure what happened, but after 3 years or so, it just started smoking and making a foul smell.  I did like the Floormate, and even though the dirty water bin was always dark, I questioned how well the Floormate cleaned.  The Floormate has rotating stiff brushes that clean.  My kids drip popsicle juice on my kitchen tile and the Floormate could never get it off, even after several passes.  I don't know if those rotating bristles don't press hard enough on my tile, or if the spaces between the rotating heads allow for surface area to be missed.  So after reading several positive reviews, I decided to give the Bissell CrossWave a try.  I think the CrossWave does a better job than the Floormate.  Because the CrossWave uses a rotating soft cloth along with bristles I think it makes better contact with my tile, therefore cleaning better.  It also cleaned the popsicle drips in just two passes!  That was enough to convince me!  Plus the head is a little smaller so I can fit into tighter spaces easier, and it has a tilting/swivel head which makes it easier to get under things.  It's also quieter than the Floormate.",10
Stephanie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great! Spend the extra money and get the cordless!,the United States,15-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I absolutely love my crosswave!

It would of been better without a cord,
R,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy,the United States,16-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is great. I have two dogs that she’d like crazy and this vacuum picks up the hair easily. It picks up dirt and cleans the floor perfectly! I was worried based on the bad reviews but maybe they received a bad vacuum. Anyways, I love this so much and it’s definitely worth getting! The only thing if you have hard caked on stains it’s not going to get those. But easy dried spilled juice type messes it’ll definitely pick up.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Ocd cleaning necessity,the United States,4-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I use this product on my tile floors, hallway, living room, kitchen.

One suggestion, slower pace when using this product, have fun cleaning ocd freaks.",
Drew,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Concept. Poor Results,the United States,28-Aug-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We loved the idea of this machine but were quickly disappointed. It works well for a while but then begins to leave streaks of dirty water. The unit was cleaned after every use but progressively got worse. It has now been sitting in the closet for months as we had to constantly get the mop up to go behind the work left by this machine,
Makenna,5.0 out of 5 stars,GAME CHANGER,the United States,11-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the most worth it purchase I’ve ever made.

Bethany Atkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this vacuum for pets!,the United States,4-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love this vacuum mop combo!! I have 2 dogs and foster up to 4 more at a time and this makes cleaning fast and easy. I only wish I would have bought the bigger one.  The clean up of the vacuum is more only cause of how much hair it picks up. The brush can get covered and a little extra water on the floor solved that problem when it happens, then it won’t leave streaks.",
kim gadberry,3.0 out of 5 stars,They need real life testers.,the United States,2-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It was light.  Definitely  for light clean up only.  Too noisy.  Left streaks.

Katie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Total Waste of Money,the United States,16-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This product is seriously the worst thing I've ever purchased. I have real hardwood floors that I work very hard to keep clean. I had been using a bottle of diluted murphy oil and a dry mop but decided to give this a try instead. I have used it 4 times now and not only does it streak my floor terribly, but I have to completely take it all apart in between each use to clean it so that it doesn't smell the next time I use it. This includes the brush and everything. I have even had to disassemble and clean in the middle of mopping to stop the streaking. Its like the brush wrings the dirty water out on your floor after you use it for a few minutes.  I actually feel sick to my stomach thinking about how much money I wasted on this thing. I should have stuck with my broom and my dry mop. Terrible...absolutely Terrible",7
Gilbert De leon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Product Ever!,the United States,9-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Totally ineffective product that creates more work for you rather than making cleaning easier.  Don't let the noise it makes create the illusion that it is working, the suction power is very weak and basically just smears what ever mess you are attempting to clean all over.  I will not waste my time using this product again, I am so disappointed that I am throwing it away after the 3rd time that I used it.  It is going in the the garbage bin, a total waste of money!  100% dissatisfied,Gil Deleon",
amyd495,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!!!,the United States,23-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I don’t usually ooh and ahh over a product. Especially a cleaning product, but this one is special. I have severe degenerative disc disease, chronic fatigue, bad fibromyalgia, and numerous other debilitating diagnoses. I live with my husband, four dogs, and a cat in a large two story home. The dogs are hard enough on the floors, but my husband is a mechanic and his busy shop is on our property. We have a ton of hard flooring throughout the house.  Not long ago, I pretty much gave up cleaning the floors. I couldn’t keep up. It would take me most of the day to vacuum, and then I would need to mop as soon as I was done vacuuming before dirt got tracked in. Then the dogs and my husband would come in. You see the problem. I am in almost constant pain, and 3-4 days per week I can hardly move. We are trying to sell our home, and I didn’t see how I could possibly get it ready for showings. I was searching for answers and came upon this magical machine. The description said it would vacuum and scrub at the same time! I read reviews and watched videos, and finally ordered the Bissell Spinwave.The Spinwave was delivered two days later. The box was in great condition. I pulled out the contents,which were packaged well. Inside the box were the handle, the machine itself, with multi floor roller brush already installed, a sample bottle of floor cleaner (enough to clean a large area two times), and the storage tray. Assembly was super easy. You take the handle, push it into the correct spot on the machine, and it clicks when it is inserted all the way. The cord is nice and long, and it winds easily onto the machine and handle. I like that the plug has the little cord grip on it so you don’t have to find a way to wrap it through the wound cord to make it stay put. I was very excited to try the machine, but was very busy for the next two days. Fast forward to Thanksgiving.It was just my husband and I for the holiday. The turkey was in the oven and all of the other food was prepared. My husband was out stacking firewood. What should I do? Play with the Crosswave of course.The machine was easily prepared. I put hot water and the included cleaning solution into the clean water reservoir. There are easy to see marks on the reservoir that show how much water and solution to use. No measuring. I popped the clean solution reservoir onto the back of the machine, plugged it in, and pressed the hard floor button on the handle. The machine whirled to life. I was surprised that it was much quieter than I expected. From some of the reviews I expected to need ear plugs. I believe it is quieter than my vacuum. I squeezed the trigger on the handle and began pushing the machine back and forth. It is pretty lightweight and quite easy to push and pull. Easier than a vacuum. I was shocked how easily it was getting spots off my floor. As you can see from one of my photos, I did a small section of the floor in the utility room. It got so clean and white. The floor in the utility room is vinyl with very deep ridges. This is the room where the dogs eat, and is the first place my husband goes to wash his hands when he comes in from work. The floor never gets clean with normal mopping, and I was expecting to have to hurt myself and get down on my hands and knees with a scrub brush. Not anymore! I had mopped my floors about a week prior, and you can see from the photo of the dirty water reservoir how much dirt came off the floor. And that picture is from my kitchen and dining room, not the utility room. Yuck! I was also pleasantly surprised to find a hook on the top of the handle that holds the cord out of the way while you are cleaning.I was worried about cleanup after I was done. No problem. I rinsed our the clean and dirty reservoir, rinsed out the filter, easily popped off the brush roll cover and the brush roll itself, and rinsed those. There is a handy drying rack on the storage tray for the roller. If you choose to do so, you can just set the machine in the storage tray, pour water into the tray to the fill line, and turn on the machine to rinse it. Then remove the brush roll, rinse it out, and place it on the drying rack. But for the first time, I chose to take it apart and check everything out. I then picked up the machine and rinsed off the base of the machine where the dirty water is sucked up. This process took maybe four minutes. No problem after the ease of mopping/vacuuming my floors. I looked over my floors. They are beautiful! And it was so easy! This is something I can do a few times a week! I haven’t been this satisfied with a product in a long time. The only thing that could make cleaning my floors easier would be for someone to do it for me. I cannot think of one con.  I would absolutely suggest this to anyone. Worth every penny. I can now have clean floors. I don’t have any opinion on the durability of the machine over time, as I have only used it once. I will try to remember to come back and write more after some time has passed.",27

I used to sweep the floors, vaccum the floors, mop the floors, then go around with a towel and wipe them.  With the cross wave it’s one trip around and no streaks.  By the way those of you worried about the cord length, it’s longer than the cord on my 500 dollar Dyson, I I have to switch plugs one time to do the whole bottom floor of my house.  Cleanup is really not that bad.  You won’t believe the pet hair this thing finds.The only con I can think is the formula, it foams up and leaves a streak so I’ve switched to just using a little splash of vinegar and warm water instead.",2

I have no idea why so many reviews mention it being feather light, but that was not the case for me at all.

Not ideal for deep cleaning as it can not reach the edges or corners. It leaves more than 1/4 inch around baseboards dirty.  You need something else to reach these areas.,
Justine,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good for instant spills,the United States,20-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This works fine for cleaning up messes that just happened or vacuuming. It does not work on messes that may have happened a little bit ago. I have small kids that spill drops of Ketchup or juice. If it is not still wet this will not pick it up.,One
bearymae74,5.0 out of 5 stars,Actually cleans!!,the United States,11-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Bought it for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Will likely purchase one for myself. She can’t believe how disgustingly dirty her floors were.,

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t function as it should.,the United States,24-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The product is so high maintenance and it still doesn’t function as it should. It leaves streaks everywhere coming out the sides, soap residue, and worst of all dirt! If you put the vacuum upright it leaves the dirt piles on your floor for you to have to clean up with paper towels. See photos above. The tank needs to be refilled after each room and the dirt container needs to be emptied each time as well. The mop doesn’t have enough power to scrub the tough stains on the floor, so you end up having to use something else along with it. Not a good mop or vacuum overall!",One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,the United States,12-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Honestly impressed! I have a toddler, dog & cat and this product makes cleaning soo much easier!

Cheryl Gardiner,5.0 out of 5 stars,How well the product works,the United States,22-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have 3 small dogs that shed all day. I love this product because you can vacuum and wash at the same time. If you chose my can just vacuum. This product works well for pet owners. It is a time saver. Very satisfied with this product.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,How did I clean without this?,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I moved to a place with all wood floors.  I purchased so I will have an easy time cleaning.  OMG it works perfect.  I now clean the floors daily, without a lot of work.  With a cat in the house it picks up the dirt, dust and cat hair great.",

George,5.0 out of 5 stars,New Shine to my Hardwood Floors!,the United States,1-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I put this together with no problems. I used the vacuum and wet cleaner on my hardwoods in den, bathroom and kitchen. The only problem is it is too large to go under the sofa and bed. When I dumped out the dirty water tank, it was full of grime and really dirty water. My floors shined like they haven't since they were new. I think the Crosswave cut through a lot of built up floor cleaner I had been using for years. I bought extra cleaning solution and an extra cleaning brush, but it comes with a small bottom of cleaner and you only use a small amount mixed with warm water in the tank. When you take apart the dirty water tank, filter, brush, etc. to clean it, it will show you just how much mess accumulates on your floors. I am very happy with this!",
Kathleen Gilmartin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of leaky - water from tray under machine.,the United States,27-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I loved the idea of the product but it just didn’t work that well for me on area rugs. It also was messy/leaky on hard (tile) floors.,

Ewaggoner,3.0 out of 5 stars,Buy the cordless and self cleaning version.,the United States,5-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I wished I had bought the cordless and self cleaning version.

We have used everything from a Shark to Swiffer to the old-school hands and knees with a bucket. This marvelous machine is BY FAR the best! It does exactly what the description says it will. Our floors haven't been this clean in forever. We used it on an area rug and the suction is so good it pulled the rug up as it was scrubbing. Love, love, love it for making my husband's and my life easier! It cleaned up the dog hair, too!",
Constance Miller,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great hardwood cleaner - but extremely loud,the United States,19-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The product works great on my hardwood floors and it’s the only mopping product I feel is cleaning the floors with clean water rather than cycling through the dirty water (like traditional mops or swifters). However, I really had to debate whether the cleaning power was worth the extreme noise level (I’m talking at least 2-3 times louder than any vacuum).",
Carole Elliott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing job!,the United States,2-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Lightweight and effective!  Wish I had purchased a long time ago.

Janice Shirley,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dissatisfied,the United States,28-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Actually I bought two. One for me and one for a Christmas gift.I was very dissatisfied with the vacuum.

Elaina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"too much trouble to clean filter, etc.",the United States,15-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I live in an apartment and it's too difficult to clean the floors because of the furniture.

Tight corners are hard, but... it’s not a deal breaker when you get a vac and mop that cleans so so so well.You can in fact “eat off of my floors” they are so clean😂",
Raquel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worked almost a whole year,the United States,27-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Worked for almost a year. I bought this vacuum last August and was so satisfied with it.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,30-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I purchase this to use on concrete floors. It seemed to just move dirt around. You could see the tracks it left.  I then tried it on one of our rugs and instead of picking up dirt it seemed to just smear it into the carpet. Sent back.,

This machine vacuums well BUT the feeble ""multi-brush"" is practically useless. I could have scrubbed my floor with a brush on my hands and knees quicker and cleaner than with this!

C. Squire,5.0 out of 5 stars,BIG TIME SAVER!,the United States,23-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"If you can love a machine, I do! our entire main floor is tile. What a time saver!

Oklahoma Girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,12-Aug-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’m happy with this.  The amount of dirt that was picked up made me feel it was really working.  I even dry mopped my floors first and it still had incredibly dirty water.  I just didn’t think my floors were that dirty.  It’s easy to clean afterwards too.  My only complaint is that it doesn’t get close to the edges, but this is still the best floor cleaner that I’ve tried.  And I trust Bissell.",
Lizi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever,the United States,2-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I cannot leave a good enough review of this product. I moved into an apartment that had previously been inhabited by a heavy smoker, so the floors were gross and tar-y. I never felt like they were getting clean, so I looked around and purchased this machine. It worked so well in my apartment that I took it into the office at work. You can see above that the floors went from black to their original color. This machine is incredible. Life changing. My apartment has never felt cleaner.Recently it flooded due to a sewer back up (SO gross) and this machine help in both water extraction and cleaning. You would never be able to tell the flood even happened. It was incredible. I've even had coworkers take this machine home to use it on their floors. Incredible. It will be the best purchase of your life.",
Jessica,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not great,the United States,20-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is a great vacuum! I have found that the hoses where the cleaning solution come out have already clogged with hair (I’ve used it a handful of times). It’s also gross to clean out as you have to reach in the get the hair out.,

Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love,the United States,20-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I normally wash my floors on my hands and knees.  I was a bit skeptical if this would work as well.  It was amazing.  I couldn't believe how much is left behind by a regular vacuum.,

I have three children (all boys), two cats, a fluffy corgi, and a black lab. We also have ALL HARDWOOD FLOORS. It was a nightmare to clean. I bought this to TREAT MAH SELF and I have never been happier with an Amazon purchase. I can get each room vacuumed and mopped at the same time with ease!

I was going to return it, but missed the cut off by two days!  It leaves my hardwood floors streaky, just not worth what it cost at all.

We have a darker shiny hardwood floor and the pet paws, footprints and smudges annoy me to the core. I was amazed at the suction ability and disgusting amount of dirt and hair that was sucked up with this cleaner. Especially bc I just cleaned my hardwoods yesterday!  I also used it on my thin dining room rug and it was great!  Highly recommend for those who can’t stand dirty smudged looking floors and want an easy quick clean!",
tricks,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't do the job well,the United States,23-Aug-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a WASTE OF MONEY and A HUGE REGRET. Perhaps one of the biggest purchase regrets I have made... The reason for this is because it will work ok at first then part way through cleaning begins making a horrible sound and leaves nasty dirty water in excess everywhere. It doesn't clean well, it leaves stripes on the floor and leaves a good cloudy film behind. The cord is way shorter than any other vacuum I've owned which is just annoying more than anything... In addition, you're supposed to clean every component and dry it after every use but it doesn't come apart easily so you can do this. You have to use a screw driver to get things apart. It is MORE WORK TO CLEAN THE VACUUM than it would be to just mop normally!! I am SO ANGRY because I haven't been able to return or get money back... Just a lot of money down the drain! I don't know how this has any positive reviews. I had super high hopes and now I just have it because I can't throw away something so expensive. It's a real bummer...",6
Gregg Rodgers,1.0 out of 5 stars,Left streaks in hardwood,the United States,14-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We returned this. I used it straight out of the box and it left a good section on the middle of the roller that didn’t clean the floor at all. I had to go over areas multiple times to make up for it.,
things_like_new,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everyone should have this,the United States,21-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Watch the promo video. It actually does all of that! It is sooo easy to use and take apart and clean. I have 3 children under 3 so there is always food on my floor and this picks it all up. I actually just vacuumed spaghetti today. If you go over stuck in spots a few times they will come up too. I’ve only tried my welcome mat and laminate floor so I can’t review on carpets yet.,
K James,3.0 out of 5 stars,Buy a vacuum and steam mop separate,the United States,1-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Bissell had a great vision to combine a vacuum/ mop, but it was not well executed. Doesn’t clean up spots easily, not agile, tough to maneuver on low pile rugs, doesn’t vacuum tile well, and messy to clean up. If I had to sum up my underwhelming experience it would be the “meh” emoji. I have kids and no pets so our floors aren’t beyond saving.",
Brandy Fausel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This Vacuum,the United States,19-Aug-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have tile and laminate floors in both stories, this vacuum makes cleaning so much easier than ever!

My house is all hardwood or tile.  It does take some time to clean out once used. I would recommend making sure all the water is out of the lines before storing. If not it can smell when you go to use it the next time,
G. Henrich,4.0 out of 5 stars,Self cleaning is longer than expected but good,the United States,27-Jan-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This works very well.

Vickie,5.0 out of 5 stars,You don’t have to get on your knees to wash the floor!,the United States,13-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I used it to clean tile floors. It does a nice job. It also shampoes the area rugs well. The cord needs to be held so it doesn’t go under the machine.,One
Roxanne Powell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed,the United States,7-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have kids and pets so I would have to sweep then mop and then sweep again. This has saved a lot of time. Its loud and dogs don't like it but hey whatever works. The suction is good(don't get it near puppy pads or it'll suck it up). Obviously you can't get it everywhere a mop will go so I still hafta sweep under counters but can suck it up. It will not get it dried crusty stuff so I still have to scrape that stuff. Read directions for use. You have to run the water thru for 10 seconds before use.,

It won't vacuum on carpet and the water leaks and will not go in the dirty container.  When I pick it up after using it, there's a puddle on the floor.

carol sawka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little machine.,the United States,28-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am totally pleased with this cleaner. It left no sticky residue, really cleaned my tile floors, and sucked up the dirty water. My floors were dry in less than one minute. The only drawback is the frequent emptying of the dirty water receptacle, but that is a minor inconvenience compared to the machines overall performance. I would definitely buy this again!",

It was exactly what I was looking for in a machine that could vacuum and mop my floors at the same time! It has good suction power, easy to clean, cuts my cleaning time by more than half. If you have little ones...this is a life saver! And yes..,the cordless one would’ve been a plus but for the cost of this one...I am more than willing to deal with the cord.",

I use the multi-surface floor cleaner and it is amazing how clean my floor is.  Am sure that a lot of the dirt it brings up first time is from using cleaners with pads that leave residue.  It did an amazing job on the grout in my tile floor in the bathroom!  I get low back pain when I use regular mops/Swiffer type cleaners and the Crosswave has really helped with that.  I love the product!,2
kas,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received Used Refurbished Item with missing pieces,the United States,1-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I ordered this item as a brand new item and received a refurbished item for the same price even though I didn't ask for this. I decided to test it out anyway. Water was leaking out of the clean water tank because of a missing piece. Water then started leaking out of the sides of the machine (where all the holes are) as well as the back bottom area where dirty water would constantly leak out of leaving dirty puddle trails.,
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst vacuum I have ever owned.,the United States,17-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have never written a review, but felt compelled due to how poorly this machine works. It worked well the first time I used it. After that it clogged almost every time, and it spits out old debris that gets trapped inside. My floors look worse after using it. Most annoying is the lack of nozzle to get in hard to reach places. I didnt realize it lacked a nozzle until using it for the first time. I wish I could return it, but I missed my window.",

I vacuum and wash the floor at the same time. I do my area rugs also by just flipping the switch. Definitely worth the money",
Amanda,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.,the United States,14-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So far so good.  My wooden floor looks clean but apparently, it was filthy.

myrna vancleave,5.0 out of 5 stars,cordless vacuum,the United States,12-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have had 3 back operations and then my car got rear ended and something in my spin was crushed. This little sweeet vacuum is light weight and i can use it just great.  It is really my second one. I wore the other one out that we had had for years.  It is really good.,
Jacqueline V Baillargeon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a must have,the United States,23-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is such a timesaver. We have two dogs that shed two kids and for inside rabbits so as you can imagine it gets pretty hairy around here. This has made life so much easier. I use it every day and you would never know that we had pets. Can’t live without it.,
The girls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great option to clean floors between hand mopping!,the United States,18-Jun-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Does a great job cleaning if done correctly. I prefer to vacuum/clean up major debris than use this to mop the floors. I have a dog so I like the idea of the dirty water/hair being collected while only spreading clean water on the floor. Works great on tile & bamboo hardwood floors. I knocked a star off because it may be as time consuming as mopping on hands & knees however it’s easier on your back!,
SUZIE-Q,5.0 out of 5 stars,The easiest way to clean and light.,the United States,18-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I knew they were good .I'm very impressed with my crosswave.i highly recommended it. Very easy from start to finish. No more mop and bucket for me.,
Ellen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,the United States,19-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It takes a little while to get used to how this machine works but once you do, it makes washing your hard floors super simple.  It does a great job at picking up all of the dirt and grime, especially if you have pets (we have 4 furbabies!)  It's also fantastic on area rugs.  Highly recommend this machine.",
Shadagee,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t really clean my floor.,the United States,22-Jun-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This just plain doesn’t clean as well as I want it too. The roller material is too soft to handle the dirt in our multi dog household.  I don’t think I’ll ever find a dual tank that is sturdy and delivers what it promises.,

I purchased this for my daughter (who lives in another state) she was very excited when it arrived. The problem is when she tried to use it!!It spit the water all over the house and unfortunately for me, by the time she received it my “return window” was up😡So now she is stuck with a machine that doesn’t work and I am out quite a bit of money😢 they will get no more of my money!!",
Kym,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Find!!!,the United States,28-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love going from my tile, wood, to throw rugs!  Makes cleaning easier and faster.  It is so easy to change from rug to bare floor that it might be a little to easy - as in I hit the button by mistake once in a while.  Super easy to clean!!!  Park it in the tray, run clean water through it and dump the dirty water.  Very well thought out,",
Beth Swindall,5.0 out of 5 stars,How did I live without this?,the United States,9-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the best floor cleaning machine ever.

Gina Webb,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT,the United States,13-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Used on my tile, hardwoods, kitchen , rugs and carpeted areas. This little machine is amazing.

Farchimp,4.0 out of 5 stars,Floor cleaner,the United States,16-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Light weight, easy to use. Does a pretty good job on tile floors and even wood floors. I have no carpet, so don't know how it works on that. Deep grime needs a few extra, slow passes, but it picks it all up. Easy to assemble, and relatively easy to clean out as well. The dirty water tank seems to need frequent dump outs, even when there is still half tank left in the clean water tank; that seems odd to me.",2
donnatayhorses,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a Good Job,the United States,27-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This machine does a very good job on dirty floors that need scrubbing. I would purchase it again. Highly recommend.,
Elizabeth SotoRuiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Money well spent!!!!!,the United States,15-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Love this vacuum. It was so light and manageable; it cleaned my bathroom, hallway, kitchen, and living room and still has clean water and solution to spare. It's the best money we've spent on a cleaning product. I have tile throughout my home and I love that I can plug it in and go. It cleaned up stains that I would usually use bleach and elbow grease to clean very easily. Bonus when I turned it on it didn't scare my blind chihuahua.",
Amber,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ugh wish I never bought it,the United States,7-Nov-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Ugh! Wish I had used it more before my return time was up. I didn’t because with all the positive reviews I thought I would love it. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Leaves dirty water when you stop. Wipe test behind the machine still shows dirty!

Maria Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, easy to use",the United States,17-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Absolutely love this mop vac. Saves time and easier than sweeping and mopping. Easy to take apart and assemble for use and cleaning.,
yvonne hampton,3.0 out of 5 stars,High maintenance vacuum,the United States,21-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This product is great, but it’s too high maintenance for me. When I clean my house I don’t want to then worry about cleaning the parts of the vacuum. If you don’t perform the cleaning after use it emits a bad odor the next time you use it and I don’t like that.",
A Happy Client,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a Timesaver,the United States,5-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Love that it vacuums at the same time for a quick clean up.  I have four dogs, so this comes in handy on a daily basis, and keeps my tile and Pergo looking clean and smelling fresh.",One
ZSayed,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not effective enough..returned,the United States,12-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Got this vacuum hoping to avoid having to clean the wood floors by hand and though it’s nice to be able to mop and vacuum simultaneously, this vacuum does not put enough pressure on the floor to actually properly clean it.  I used the vacuum around the house with liberal use of the fluid and several passes and then wiped the floor with a Clorox wipe and still picked up a lot of dirt...needless to say, I returned the vacuum",One
kaytee,5.0 out of 5 stars,top of the line,the United States,16-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"i've used this brand before. i did return the vacuum, only based on it was an impulse purchase. this vacuum is desired by many. it's a good buy.",
EE,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Great product. It is heavy and difficult to maneuver in small areas and corners especially when there are furnitures around. It cleans well and is easy to use.,
Hirata,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,the United States,25-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,So far this works great and really cleaned our bamboo floors.  You can feel the difference and feels a lot cleaner.  Amazed how dirty the water was.,One
Miranda Hartman,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Crosswave!,the United States,28-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This Crosswave has made cleaning my floors so easy. It vacuums and mops at the same time, and with a touch of a button, you can spray the cleaning solution as much or as little as you need. It's great on my laminate and tile floors and it literally leaves my floors squeaky clean. All of the parts easily click in and out and cleaning is super easy. I highly recommend this!",

SAME PROBLEM!!,the United States,20-Sep-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I loved the convenience of this vacuum while it worked, BUT it has broken twice in less than 2 years !!!  The Bissel  replaced the first one when the motor would repeatedly shut off. Now the replacement is doing the same thing!!  This is a lot of money for a machine that keeps breaking.  BEWARE!!!!  DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!  Waste of money.",One
RPM,4.0 out of 5 stars,good product but leaves streaks,the United States,7-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"you would be amazed at how ""clean"" you think your floors are.  this thing picks up so much grime it's unbelievable, but it is loud and leaves streaks on the floor, which is too bad because it works pretty well.",
SS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Have!!,the United States,29-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Probably the best investment I have ever made for myself. This machine is better than my vacuum!! Love love love it!! Deserves 10 stars.,
Michelina,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waist of my money,the United States,20-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,What a waists of money if you ask me. Have to change the roller out every time you use it or it smells terrible! It works for smalls stuff but honestly should have spent my money else where 🙄 thought it would make cleaning up easier but takes the same amount of effort as filling up the mop bucket. Except the mop bucket doesn’t smell bad.,
Dave Mer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Get it, you won’t regret it",the United States,12-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Absolutely love this thing! Makes clean ups so much easier! Yes it has the cord but all the cordless ones run only about 30 minutes per charge. The cord is a small price to pay to get your whole house done without worrying about a charge. Totally worth the buy,
Tripper in SC,1.0 out of 5 stars,It does great as a broom,the United States,28-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It does great as a broom, but is an awful mop!  We have tile floors and all it does is spread the dirt around leaving a dirty film on the floor.  It picks up very little water, and puts down far more than it picks up.  If you have tile floors, don't waste your money.",67
Cristina,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It sucks, and not in a good way!",the United States,2-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Broke during the second use.  It has a mind of it's own.  It toggles back from hardwood to rug setting all on its own.  When I am trying to clean hardwood it reverts to rug mode and vice versa. At some point it vomits water and formula and then sometimes the water function works fine. When it does work it does an adequate job.  Incredibly disappointing.,One
MoG,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s ok,the United States,22-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I like this machine to clean my hardwood but when it comes to carpet it can’t seem to get the stains out and the “vacuum” function isn’t great either. More of a cleaner than a vacuum to actually pull stuff out. Overall I still use it when I get stubborn stains to pull out as much as I can and on hardwood it’s great for clean slate,

I've redubbed it ""My Dream Machine""  We have two dogs and a cat and it gets all the hair... I did NOT rinse it down my sink drain... took it outside and dumped it and then rinsed it ..but that is just because I didn't want all that dog hair down my drain.  It's worth the extra step!!!",One

JT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great addition to your cleaning arsenal,the United States,7-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Easy to set up, use and clean.

brandygirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best cleaner ever,the United States,9-Mar-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Hands down must have. With 2 adults, 2 kids and 2 HUGE dogs this is a game changer. It used to take me 1-1.5 hours to clean my hard floor. Now with the cross wave I am able to get it all done in 1/2 hour. It is so easy to use and does an amazing job. I will never go back to a broom and mop!!! I love my cross wave",
Darnell C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell,the United States,20-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love it. Lightweight, easy to clean, and it’s amazing the amount of grime that it cleans up from your floor after you have already mopped",
KRo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer!,the United States,14-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Game changer for my cleaning routine! I love it! The ONLY downside is having to spend more time cleaning the machine when I’m done using it. But that’s well worth it when the vacuuming and mopping is done all at once!,
Ana V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for pet owners!!!!,the United States,13-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Disregard the negative reviews, either those people received a  defected product or they aren't easy to please. I got my Bissell an hour ago and I'm already addicted to it. The only draw back is that you have to use a rag to manually clean the floor around the baseboards but this is not a huge deal!!! It still does a good job, on the carpet, it removed almost all cat hair from a dark brown rug. I love my Bissell!I will update my review if there are any changes, good or bad!",13

Goodwitch,4.0 out of 5 stars,... been mopped the day before it really did a good job of cleaning the floors,the United States,1-Jun-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Have only used once so far but considering that the floors had just been mopped the day before it really did a good job of cleaning the floors.  Very easy to use. Pretty much like shampooing your carpets but much lighter to maneuver.  Only thing that slows you down is having to clean everything when finished.,One
Paulald41,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would recommend the cross wave to everyone,the United States,14-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have three dogs one is a large goldendoodle who runs around and gets her feet very muddy. I heard this machine did a great job cleaning floors so I ordered one. This is a fantastic cleaner. I had a floor steamer but the floors were still dirt after you used it. The cross wave removes the mud and leaves your floors clean.,
Stacey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this floor cleaner!!,the United States,27-Feb-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this floor cleaner! Vacuums and scrubs at the same time. Easy to use. I have a large area of wood look tile. The Crosswave gets it cleaner than scrubbing on you hands and knees. It continuously applies clean water/solution and sucks up dirty water into a separate tank so you aren’t cleaning with grimy water from the scrub bucket. The roller brush rotates to clean and has a row of bristle brush to scrub off stuck on dirt. Thorough cleaning of the machine is required but is a short and easy process. Would definitely recommend this floor cleaner!!!!,2
Rochelle P,2.0 out of 5 stars,Needs a thorough cleaning after every single use,the United States,22-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I like the suction powers. I dislike the amount of filth that rolls out the bottom if every single part isn’t cleaned every single time.,
LT,4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes for a quick 2-in-1 job,the United States,23-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Only complaints few minutes to clean everything but overall easy to use.

Maureen Hudson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent price and quality for a refurbished model,the United States,22-Apr-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Absolutely love it!  Had some doubts about buying a refurbished model- thought I was buying somebody else's problem- but this machine has no issues whatsoever. I had an old Bissell laminate floor cleaner years ago that died of old age so this was purchased to replace the useless brooms and mops I've been trying to clean with. I was terribly skeptical of a machine that sweeps and mops at the same time but I tried it and was very pleased with the outcome. My floor hasn't looked this good in a long time.,One
C D Howard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior!!!,the United States,16-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,WOW! Superior performance over my last 3Hoover Floor Mates. No leaks. Easy to disassemble and clean. Superio engineering and style. I cannot adequately express how happy I am with this purchase.,

Hoda soliman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,the United States,3-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Works great and light weight.  Love the separate water tanks and the fact that it cleaned area rugs as well. I also like the fact that all the parts can be taken apart to clean out the dirt inside it.The only issue I see is that it doesn’t clean to the edge leaving about 1.2” to be cleaned by hand.,
Ben Kulbertis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly useless,the United States,13-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've been using this for a few months and this was one of my worst purchases in a long time. In the interest of saving space in my apartment a vac/mop sounded like a great way to go. I 100% wish I had just bought two machines. This thing can't do either of its jobs well. It can vaccum on hard floor alright, but carpet it leaves things everywhere or spits them back out. Don't even get me started on the mop function, it won't get even the easiest of dirt off the floor. I can grab a paper towel and windex and clean the same spot up in 3 seconds. There is literally no point in using it.",
Somerset juggalette,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok,the United States,30-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It is corded works better than cordless but dont bump it in front cheaply made and cracks if u hit the leg of couch. But just ok not worth the money u pay though,

Tyler Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Picks the dirt up as you go!,the United States,18-Aug-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have been looking for a machine like this for years. The reason this machine works is the HIGH suction power of the vacuum and surface contact with floor. I am able to clean 2500 square feet of floor (Wood, tile, and laminate) in a little over an hour versus a half day chore before. Very effective because it picks the dirt up off the floor versus mopping it around.",2

J,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price.,the United States,7-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Very expensive for what it does. Pain in the rear to clean when done using. Does a very mediocre job of cleaning solid surface floors. I regret this purchase.,

Jessyca Coleman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hate it.,the United States,10-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I hate this thing. I spent more time cleaning the machine then it did “cleaning” my floors. If you vacuum twice a day and use this it might actually clean things. If you’re expecting it to replace your vacuum, spoiler alert: it doesn’t.I wish I could return it but my dogs ate the box it came in. Maybe I can give to  someone who is easily impressed by things that are marginally effective or someone that enjoys cleaning machines that are supposed to do the cleaning.",

Wanna be snorkeling,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works effectively,the United States,30-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Only used it once, seems to work well.  Easy to assemble.  Dries the floor fairly well too.  Better suction picking up crumbs from the floor than I anticipated.  I have other Bissell products that have held up very well, I am hoping this one does too.  I like that it comes with a little mat so that water wont drip on the floor when you put it in the closet.",One
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,19-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The only 2 things I hate about it are messy cleanup and pricey refills.

Marshal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Motor lasted one YEAR,the United States,14-Sep-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The overall product is good. I used it on my hard wood floors, and also carpets. If you have pets, this a must have device.I'm giving it a 1 star because the motor just stopped out of nowhere recently. I tried calling customer service, and they were no help.On average, I cleaned my floors once a week on Sundays for a year. The device is $250, plus cleaning solutions, and extra brushes.If it had lasted 3yrs, I'd be happy with the purchase.",
Lindsey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bissel for sale,the United States,19-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Whoever talked me into buying this POS can go straight to hell. First use- great, loved it. Quickly learned that if you don't have a power washer to clean out all the pieces it will make your house smell like a dirty hobo. It's more work to clean all the pieces than it is to mop on my hands and knees.On a completely unrelated note- I have a used Bissell Crosswave vacuum for sale. Any reasonable offers will be accepted.",
Sarah Andrews,5.0 out of 5 stars,Soooooo easy to use and lives up to the product description,the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Holy moly...my boys had just vacuumed the area rug and two small floors in which we first tested our new crosswave...needless to say I’m beyond impressed and grossed out for the best possible reason...all that crap is not in my rug or on my floors which I thought were kinda clean!!!!,
Sailndayz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised.  Wonderful.,the United States,24-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Wonderful light weight cleaning tool.  Doesn’t oversaturate my flooring.

JJW-Mom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Finally! Doesn’t kill my back!,the United States,11-Aug-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"When we bought this house, I thought the flooring was beautiful. It’s stained stamped concrete. BUT it has a bazillion tiny divots and grooves. I tried mopping (3 kids and 2 dogs track in a lot of dirt) but the mop turned the dirt to mud and the mud got stuck in all the divots. I finally found something that actually CLEANED my floor, without me having to get in my hands and knees with a scrub brush.  I would have given it 5 stars if the dirty and clean reservoirs were bigger and the scrubbing brush doesn’t go all the way to the edges, leaving about an inch gap on either side. Overall, I am VERY happy with the performance of this product. It’s well made and worth the price.",
Jessica Bauer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,the United States,22-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Clogs with short dog/cat hair - leaves streaks on hardwood - isn't ideal for even small surface rugs.,
MAC110,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great on untreated cement floors,the United States,21-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I use this product in our industrial loft on untreated cement floors. It has been a trooper seeing how much work it has to do. There are some pretty long run times that I’ve used it for, and at the most it may get a little fussy. At those times I just clean it out change the brush and it is back to normal. I love it for me!!!",

LaShawn Krom,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT!!!!!,the United States,21-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! I suggest vacuuming first. Especially the corners because it doesn't get into corners or tight spots along floor board. Less cleaning of filter also if vacuum first, then it will be more efficient and save time.",
Norb Kroll,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAAAAAAAT!,the United States,19-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Wife love how it cleans hardwood floors and ceramic floors especially pourous tiles.Only drawback is you have to disassemble it to clean. (Recommended),
Robert B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the money,the United States,30-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I mopped as I normally do and then tested this product and it pulled up so much more dirt. I will never use a traditional mop again.,

jake,5.0 out of 5 stars,... on purchasing this item but after getting it I love it. It is great on smoother flooring and ...,the United States,24-Oct-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I really was hesitant on purchasing this item but after getting it I love it.  It is great on smoother flooring and my hardwood. If you have tile that is not smooth it doesn't clean as well but if you give your floor a good scrubbing this Bissell is great for keeping it up..  Easy to use and very light weight. I like that I can pull it out of the closet and use on spills or messes. I also liked it when I cleaned my entry rugs.. They were low pile and it worked awesome. This product is best I found used on smooth floors and very low profile carpets.. Great product for not a lot of money.,2
Summer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Highly disappointed,the United States,29-Jan-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited about this vacuum, and I was highly disappointed. I wanted my cleaning to be easier and faster, with this product that is not possible. It was leaving hair clumps on my rug. I did like it for the hard floors but didn’t feel it cleaned them that great. The worst part is the clean up, you have to clean the tank, the filter, the brush, the inside of the vacuum...it was more of a hassle than making my life easy!",

Elizabeth A Mathews,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great!,the United States,28-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This cleaner has made it so much easier for me to keep my floors clean.

micca,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,the United States,10-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Definitely like it a lot for being able to vacuum and clean at once but for anything that has been on the floor for longer than a couple hours it doesn’t really do the job.

Kim Hawkins,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,13-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I don’t love this machine- and for the price I wanted to love it. It does clean hair and small rocks/dirt, but it leaves streaks and doesn’t get spots off my hardwood floors. I feel as though it needs a steamer function to help with cleaning.",
L. Bly,4.0 out of 5 stars,"BUY IT, IT’S GREAT",the United States,20-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I normally don’t do this, but the CrossWavehas made life better for me.

Laurie N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient for light cleaning,the United States,25-Aug-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This Bissell Crosswave is easy to use, easy to clean and does a great job for light to medium cleaning. It's nice to be able to use the same machine on our low pile Flor tiles as on our hardwoods and vinyl flooring. We used it on a painted porch floor to clean up the thick spring pollen and it was a champion. So much easier than sponge mops, that's for sure.",

It works great.",One
Kia Sadler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life saver,the United States,19-Jun-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I have dark wood floors that go throughout the first floor of my home. It’s normally a hassle to keep clean with pet hair and having to sweep/vacuum then mop the floors. This all in one cuts my time more than in half and gets the floors pretty clean. I will probably find another solution compatible with this because the all purpose cleaner doesn’t make the wood shine. But this is a much needed buy.,

kanika gupta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Started making loud noise after 2 uses,the United States,4-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This vacuum has started making loud noise after 2 uses. Its suction power is not that great if you are just vacuuming on the carpet. Loud noise clearly shows something is wrong with the main battery.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it!,the United States,28-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Love! We just completely remodeled a home and dust is EVERYWHERE. This worked SO well for that! I did the multi use water combo then again with just water. Don’t expect it to be perfect after one pass it’s a mop after all but it is MUCH better than a swifter or traditional mop.,

Kyle Mc,5.0 out of 5 stars,Booooo!,the United States,11-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This was the worst purchase ever. Huge disappointment. It’s more for if your floor is a little dusty. It’s cleans nothing off the floor like you expect. Would 100% not recommend. I had high hopes. Looked and looked  finally got it. Should just get a mop and bucket. Don’t waste time or money.,

I recommend!",the United States,15-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I'm always interested in cleaning gadgets (especially one that is ergonomically designed).

Jennifer Owings,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money,the United States,18-Feb-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Worked ok for awhile but after the warranty period ended it lost all suction.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s just alright at cleaning high traffic areas,the United States,11-Jul-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,. Suction power is alright on thick machine.

Carrie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, Not Great",the United States,15-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,The vacuum function works fine but I’m not impressed with its mopping capability. This will not clean up anything that actually requires any amount of scrubbing.,

Kathryn Lakvold,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pain the butt to clean,the United States,29-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Have to clean it each time.  To do that you have to disassemble it each time.  Takes as much time to clean it after you use it as it does to clean your floor.  As a result it doesn’t really save you time.,
prairiewriter63,4.0 out of 5 stars,a must have for floors,the United States,3-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"it is great on my carpet though it says bare floors and area rugs. Lightweight and easy to use, no hassle clean up, too! The directions do say you can vacuum and wash at the same time, I say, use your regular vac FIRST, get as much crud off the floor as you can, and THEN use this. The clean up will be better for both the floor and the Bissel Crosswave!",

shoes,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but get the pet version if you have animals,the United States,15-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Great product but I wish I had upgraded to the pet version to get the strainer in the dirty water bin. I underestimated how important that would be since I don't want to dump hair down my drain. It's really gross trying to separate the hair out of the dirty water. I think the strainer should be a standard feature on all models. You have to clean the whole thing after each use.  It isn't a deal-breaker for me. I still save so much time over at the mop and bucket method!,One

Tinana716,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dog hair,the United States,26-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I love this product! It came highly recommended because we have a dog that sheds a lot. It vacuums up the hair and wet mops the floor at the same time.,

Tressa Ellis,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great Idea; Bad Design,the United States,11-Dec-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this product thinking it would be the perfect way to pair vacuuming and mopping and cut down on cleaning time. While it does serve its purpose, it is incredibly difficult to clean the vacuum itself. There are way too many pieces that need to be removed, soaked, washed, and dried with each use. There are these tiny spaces all over the vacuum that are almost impossible to get at and I end up leaving them grimy half the time. The worst thing is, if you don't clean the device with every single use, it begins to work terribly and make the floor dirtier than it started. The bottom line is: I bought this to cut down on cleaning time, and I end up spending more time cleaning the vacuum than my apartment.",
Keith,5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife loves it,the United States,8-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,She actually enjoys cleaning our hardwood floors with this device.  And she says it does a great job.  She is happy.  And that makes me happy.,

Cons having to clean the filter after every use to prevent mold and the cleaning Bissell cleaning solution is a bit expensive.,

I highly recommend this produce.",
Brody Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is a game changer,the United States,2-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Literally took ten seconds to assemble, add the water and cleaning solution and put it to use. It's not very heavy, so pushing it around isn't hard to do. I also love how it swivels from left to right, making it even easier to move around. It does a very good job moving from carpet to hardwood without issues with the convenient button at the top of the handle. As far as cleaning goes, I wish I had snapped a picture at how DISGUSTING the water was afterwards. Best $250 spent thus far on a vacuum cleaner.",2
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great except along baseboards,the United States,6-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Love this to sweep and mop at the same time.

I just washed two thick, handmade wool rugs and it got the loose debris and washed the rugs very thoroughly.

Thomas W Eder,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't last.,the United States,12-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"For 2 years and 3 months this product functioned pretty much as advertised.  Tile floors were cleaned quite well.  Cleaning of the unit itself was straight-forward, but time consuming.  3 months after the 2 year warranty expired, the brush motor suddenly quit working.  A Bissell service center quoted a new brush motor at about $40, with an additional charge for labor.  If the circuit board was involved, costs would be higher.  At this point the unit has cost me more than $100 per year.  Spending more on repair with an unknown future useful life does not seem to be a smart choice.  At this point a sponge mop seems to be the most attractive option.",One

It cleans my floors/rugs really well plus saves time. From my experience in mopping & vacuuming, my floors are much cleaner.  I don’t do many reviews, however I felt like this product certainly deserved good marks!  Thanks Bissell!!!",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, poor product support for a manufacturing defect.",the United States,24-Jun-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"On hard floors it is cleaner and easier than mopping. On carpets it cleans spots and dirt not removed by dry vacuuming as well as freshening the carpet. I would give it five stars except that after only 4 uses, five months after I bought it it went totally dead and would not turn on. Bissell said it was still under warranty and told me to take it to a nearby vacuum repair shop they provided. However, the shop said they could not start to work on it for at least 30 days, and would need an OK from Bissell they had still not received. Not good product support for a manufacturing defect.",
Silvey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans very well!  Easy to use!,the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Very happy with this purchase!  It cleans my wood floor and tile floors with ease.

Tracy W,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans great,the United States,21-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Works great.  I sweep first with my bissell then use the cross wave to clean and I get even more dog hair it’s unbelievable.  Cleans floors great and my area rug too.,

Scott glaze,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works decent not worth the price.,the United States,22-Sep-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It works as an okay vacume and gets obvious messes up but the floor looks smuggy and dingy when im finished. I still have to go over it with a swiffer mop to get it to look good. Wish i had returned it within the return window not worth the price.,
Ursula,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Buy,the United States,28-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I like the Crosswave.  I have tile floors. It’s easy to use. So much better to use than a mop and broom.

Robert Richard Rivera Jr.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,4-Oct-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"After having this for a few weeks I feel like it’s not that great.  It leaves streaks and prints on my floors.  I have LVP flooring.  I went back over part of my floor today with a microfiber cloth, where I had already mopped with the bissell and picked up so much more dirt.  I had to do that to get it completely clean",
Amanda Gibson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Neither “feature” works very well,the United States,3-Apr-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I’m finally giving up on this vacuum. I can’t believe how poorly it works for how expensive it is. Using the wet feature just creates mud that gets smeared all over your floors. Using the regular/dry vacuum feature doesn’t do a thorough job picking up hair (or much of anything), and it gets clogged so easily. Suuuuch a disappointing use of $200. Wish I’d just spent the money on a decent $100 dry vacuum and then bought a good mop.",

My floor physically feel clean after using this sorcery! I don't know how this magic works but it 100% does. It's so satisfying to see all that dirty water at the end and admire my clean, shiny floors. I've had this for about 2 months now and use it twice a week, still works just as good as day 1!",
Tori Kitchen,2.0 out of 5 stars,No suction and high maintenance,the United States,6-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Very minimal suction power. You spend more time cleaning the inside of the vacuum for it to function properly than you do cleaning up the mess. Don’t recommend,

samqjones,5.0 out of 5 stars,It cleans the floors!!!!!!,the United States,7-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It CLEANS the floor!  Even the sticky spots (spilled honey).The unit cleans up very easily.  The dirty water reservoir, a filter, and the brush head.  The unit can be picked up and the vacuum area can be rinsed and the bottom.I also cleaned an area rug.  Great job!",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good,the United States,4-Feb-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It works about as well as my steam mop. A spot of dried on chocolate milk needs several passes to clean up, and something thicker like dried on pasta sauce requires getting it with a rag separately. For messes that are still wet it’s awesome! I like that there is always clean water, so it feels cleaner than a mop. It does not get the grout clean or do hard scrubbing for dried on spills. Overall, it’s much easier than mopping so I think I would buy it again.",

I used to have to use a swifter to get my floors clean and it never got fully clean. With the crosswave you can clean your hardwood floors just like vacuuming but it has a cleaning solution that mops up the dust and dirt. I also love that you can take off the parts, clean them and put them back on like it’s brand new!!!",

It definitely does the job of getting rid of everything as you can see the dirty water tank full everytime. Easy to use, light to maneuver. I use it in conjunction with the Bissell cross wave wood floor cleaner--cleanup is easy and the floor does not stay wet for more than a minute. Only thing it doesn't do is leave the floor with a high gloss look so I have to follow it up with a separate mop polish finish.",3

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,So good... it'll scare you into product loyalty!,the United States,11-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"I have 2 small dogs and 3 cats in a house with dark wood floors. To top it off, I board dogs in my house from time to time. I run my robotic vacuum daily and sweep and mop once weekly. The hair from all the pets clogs the robotic vacuum, so it's become quite cumbersome to maintain. When researching my next robotic, I happened to see a commercial for this guy, and after reading a lot of reviews, I was convinced. And I'm not disappointed that I went with this instead!In one pass, I was able to both vacuum and mop... a huge time and back-saver. The amount of dirt in the canister was so disgusting, I couldn't believe I had been living like this for so long! And to top it off, months and months of cats tracking clay litter with their paws had practically whitened the floors in some areas (see photos). No amount of mopping or scrubbing, even on my hands and knees with a bristle brush, had been able to get these areas back to even close to their original color. With the Crosswave, even these spots are practically glistening again!A few tips I learned for my own floors:- Use very warm water and solution to the proper line levels- Try to go with the grain of wood if at all possible to help avoid streaking- Hold trigger to deposit solution only while pushing the vacuum forward- Once solution is deposited, pull vacuum backward, toward you, very slowly. You can feel the suction and, if you go slowly enough to keep that suction strong, the dirty solution will be sucked right up!- If it's been a while since you swept or vacuumed, a really quick pass to get the bigger debris up in vacuum mode will make the process quicker (but that's not necessary)Bottom line: I absolutely love this all in one. I might still get a new robotic for daily maintenance but I will surely be using this a couple times a week. It's truly terrifying to realize how filthy the floors had been! I'm officially scared into product loyalty!",150

S. Marion,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can't believe how dirty my floors were!!!,the United States,24-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am so incredibly happy with this mop.  We have dogs that go in and out and track muddy prints in on a daily basis.  I have tried using wet mops to clean the floor, but the amount of pet hair that gets clogged on the mop heads is just disgusting. Swiffer works for about 4 square feet. I'd need 100 wipes to clean my house!  I can't use a broom because the floor might be wet, and even then I'm just swiping the dirt all over the place.  This crosswave is exactly the tool I have been searching for for years.  I can use as little or as much cleaning solution as I want, depending on how dirty the floors are.  It sweeps, it cleans, and I can have nice floors without a ton of effort.  Also, unlike my dyson and roomba vacuums (you can tell I've tried everything!), I don't have to stop every time I use it to clean it out. Yes, I still dump and rinse the dirty container, but I don't have to go digging into the brushes to clean out the pet hair. Dust and pet hair all show up like magic in the dirty water container.  It's also amazing how much dirt I am picking up every single day. I am genuinely happy and my only hope now is that it keeps working for a long time...",5

I have pets that shed and a house that gets messy especially in the winter months! I used my cross wave for the first time on my tile floors and my area rugs and it worked wonders. My rugs looked brand new and my floors felt so clean. It really does exactly what it says it will do. It sucked up every piece of hair, pebbles and miscellaneous mess in my house and cut my cleaning time in half. No more sweeping, then vacuuming and then finally mopping.

It used to take me an hour and fifty minutes to sweep and mop my hardwood floors. Now it only takes 50 minutes to do the whole house! Tip: you kinda have to go back an fourth kinda slow.  It doesn't do a good job if you think your going to whip it around like a vacuum cleaner. Its so easy to clean! All snaps apart. Take it outside and spray it down with a water hose.,

It is easy to use for quick spills and messes and with a very old pup with bladder issues it is a must! Love that it vacuums and mops at the same time!!

If I could hug the engineers at Bissell I would. We bought a house with a mishmosh of flooring, tile, laminate, wood, vinyl AND carpet. To say it's a nightmare to clean the floors is an understatement and with 2 year old twins and pets our floors can get pretty gross plainly put. Chunks of food, pet hair, yogurt, Lord knows what caked on there some days... Not any more! This thing is amazing.

I followed all of the troubleshooting steps and even Googled some which I tried to no avail.  So... it now works as a vacuum and *very light duty* wet cleaner but that's it.

I've read through the entire instruction booklet, and have followed the recommendations, but every time I use this, it doesn't vacuum well at all, and leaves dirty streaks all over the hardwood floors. Once it dries, it looks terrible. I'm returning it to Amazon today, because I seriously hate this machine. Way overpriced for something that doesn't work.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's a no for me.,the United States,18-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Honestly save your money. I had high hopes for this and was severely let down. I gave it 2 stars only because it does kinda vacuum hard floors but as far as mopping goes it just smears the dirt around your floor and has no scrubbing abilities what so ever. I'd say skip it and stick with a broom and mop.,

D. Bush,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick and easy floor cleaning,the United States,19-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"New favorite purchase. And I feel like a dork for saying it but I love this thing. Easy to use, does a good job. Have to clean the machine when done but it’s still less work than the separate vacuuming and mopping I used to do. Also good for laminate floors which is great!",
Eric von Letkemann,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely despise this vacuum.,the United States,24-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Please please please, don’t do like I did and buy this. Hardly sucks anything up and most definitely does not clean the hardwood floors good. Plus if you get done cleaning your floors it will leave black streaks all over your carpet. Such a shame and a massive waste of money.",
Amanda Yates,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just Average,the United States,13-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It’s convenient for vacuuming and mopping at the same time. It worked okay for a small apartment or reasonably clean area. I didn’t feel like it had amazing suction or power.,

Chantal Berho,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed,the United States,29-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Very disappointed!

J.B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t Bother,the United States,21-Jul-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the most disappointing purchase I’ve made. This doesn’t function as a regular vacuum, much less as a “mop”. It basically pushes around dirty water. There’s no suction so it pushes around dusty bunnies and dirt alike. I clean my home faster using a broom and a regular mop. Don’t waste your money like I did. You’ll spend twice having to purchase this vacuum’s replacement.",One
D. O. Pulling,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good floor cleaner,the United States,28-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It has replaced a Shark steam mop AND a vacuum for kitchen tile clean up.,
K Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase for clean freaks,the United States,12-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to clean my newly installed porcelain tile and it does an amazing job!!!  I was in the process of selling my home so I needed something that would make cleaning the floor easier and faster and THIS WAS IT!! I have had it for about 4 months and it still works great. I have cleaned porcelain tile, laminate, wood flooring, small spots on carpet and even the garage floor (I know I have a cleaning problem lol). I have had to get a new filter and brush but I was cleaning some seriously dirty floors. This thing isn't perfect but it's pretty close. It is louder than I thought, so don't clean outside a sleeping kids room. It doesn't do a great job on carpet or rugs but if it's a small cleanup right after something happened, it does a decent job. The cleaner that comes with it is nice smelling but I have been using just water lately and that seems to work fine too.",5
Christine P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The dirt is gone!,the United States,9-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,We love our Crosswave. We should have bought it sooner. No more pushing the dirt around. Our floors shine and we love it.,
Laura Crim,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed with the quality of cleaning,the United States,19-Aug-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"The product seemed like it would work. The brush rolls and it vacuums up the dirty water, but if you are looking for deep cleaning your grout - DON't spend the $249.00.I read the reviews and everyone said it cleaned tile floors and grout. It really works as good as a mop in that the brushes do roll and it does vacuum but it doesn't have enough power to really clean tile.I sure do wish it cleaned like it claimed to. The whole machine is very lightweight plastic...so I am planning to use ittill something breaks.. very disappointed.",
K9J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great time saver,the United States,13-Dec-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This thing is awesome. It cleans and vacuums my hardwood and vinyl floors in one step cutting my time in half. Just don’t forget to clean the collection tank before putting it away.,

I live in the country so there’s always sand and dirt in my home. This machine picks up everything and all the dog hair you can handle. Only complaint is that the brush needs more hard bristles so it would brush harder.  Highly recommend.,

M&K Walker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very convenient.,the United States,22-Feb-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This is a great tool! My friend tried mine and has bought herself one. I like that the liquid container is smaller so you don't have all that extra weight and sloshing going on. Cleans up easy.,2

mtlemieux,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good vacuum!,the United States,6-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Collection for vacuum vs. map containers should be separated. Other than that, vacuum smells when using to vacuum after having previously used it to map even though I allowed to thoroughly dry out.

Tayanita Hodges,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money!,the United States,18-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I don't understand all the negative reviews on here, my hardwood floors AND my area rug look so freaking clean now. No dirty streaks, no build up of any sort. AND I own 2 dogs one is a purebred husky and the other is part husky, and their hair was no match for the Crosswave. The Crosswave was SO worth the money. Just keep it clean and you should be fine 🙂",
Shyra,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY,the United States,9-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I was so excited to get this vacuum but 3 months later the vacuum cleaner doesn't suck as well anymore & the mop part leaves large puddles of dirty water from time to time & leaves streaks.

Annie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for Hard Floor Mopping!!!,the United States,10-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have been waiting for something like this all my life! I love not having to sweep first. This leaves the floor truly dust free. The suction is really good. I can see fur fly into it from a few inches away. It won't vacuum larger items like a regular vacuum would. You have to pick up the scraps of paper first. But dust, fur, hair, dirt clods...no problem. It feels as if it really hat getting the floor cleaner than a mop could. It is constantly using clean water and rinsing the mop roll while getting rid of the dirty water. The floor dries in about 10 minutes, way faster than a mop. It can only come within an inch and a half of the wall but it will suck the dust and dirt all the way to the wall but it leaves an unwashed gap. Only in the dirtiest areas did I have to wash that space with a rag.  I would not buy this to function as my vacuum.  This is an awesome mopping device. I drag out my regular vac for carpets and rugs. I wasn't impressed with the carpet washing mode. I love this as a hard floor mop I don't need it to be my carpet vac or carpet shampooer.",3
steven,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as expected,the United States,9-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I would not buy this again.  The first time I used it, it was okay.

Lilly Tudor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans very well.,the United States,22-Aug-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Love this machine. This is all I use when cleaning my tile floors. Even cleans the grout lines. Very pleased as this reduces my workload.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vac/mop,the United States,27-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,It's a great vacuum/ Mop but I wish it had sperate compartments for the dirt and water pick up. Maybe a strainer built into the bin? Other than that complaint I'm happy,One
Jaime,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ineffective at Cleaning,the United States,6-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes for this machine, after rave reviews from a friend.  The price seemed steep, but I was bewitched by the idea of being able to vacuum and wash the floors at the same time.  While the Crosswave is lightweight and easy to set up, it is ineffective at cleaning and therefore was a poor use of money.I first tried this machine on an area rug; it didn't seem to be really ""scrubbing"" the material but instead just lightly grazing it.  It also didn't suction the water back up well at all- there was very little water in the dirty tank when I finished and the rug was very damp.I next tried cleaning the tile kitchen floor.  While the machine did thoroughly wet the tile with solution and this time was much more efficient at suctioning the fluid back up, it didn't actually clean the floor!  Despite multiple passes, it didn't scrub or otherwise remove dirt.  I had to go back and mop the floor afterward.There are two small things that I do like about this machine:1. The cord was a useful length (I haaaaate when vacuums and similar small appliances have ridiculously short cords, leaving you stuck hopping from outlet to outlet)2. The Crosswave is useful for vacuuming smaller areas, instead of dragging out my much heavier Dyson.Overall, the few positive attributes of this machine do not save it from being a piece of crap.  I am very disappointed in how it performed, especially for the price tag, and I would not purchase this item again.  Boo.  :(",2
Sara Hartz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Would not recommend!,the United States,12-Apr-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Not impressed whatsoever. I have 2 dogs and it constantly was getting clogged with hair, leaving dirty streaks, and overall left my floors still dirty.

It cannot pick up large debris (example popcorn), the wet part leaves muddy streaks and puddles everywhere, and the clean up of the vaccum itself is time and effort.

The CrossWave makes quick work of it, and the floor is ""bare-foot clean"".On a side not I originally bought mine from Bissell.  After a week I called and asked for a tracking number.

I have hardwood, linoleum, and a little bit of carpet.  And a dog.  I wanted something that was light and easy to maneuver and when I found out you didn't have to vacuum first I thought I hit the jackpot.  The suction even when dry vacuuming is marginal at best.  The machine leaks dirty water even with the water tanks seated properly and after being checked for blockages.  Not worth the money and it's going in the garbage.  I expected more from Bissell.",

Kristy Ellis,4.0 out of 5 stars,This floor cleaner is amazing on carpet & rugs,the United States,25-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This floor cleaner is amazing on carpet & rugs.  Decent as a cleaner on hard floors.  It comes apart in several pieces so you can actually get the whole thing clean.  No just out of reach places that mold and mildew.  It does require 24 hours to dry before putting it back together, which means parts hanging around instead of just popping it back together and putting it away.",

We have porcelain tile floors that look like wood.  They have a lot of texture to them, but this seems get down in the cracks and pull out the dirt.  We were cleaning them previously with a steamer type mop.  Unbelievable how much cleaner they look and feel using the CrossWave.  Seems to be extremely effective floor cleaning tool.  we only use on tile and haven't tried it on any other surfaces.  They dry very quickly.  No pooling of water on the floors.  Not sure how clean it will keep the grout, but time will tell on that.  The floors are almost brand new, so not alot of wear and tear on them yet.  The suction does a great job pulling the water up.  We've only used the Bissell cleaner specifically made for this.  The cord comes out near the bottom and is in an awkward spot, but we just hold it up and it's no issue.  If you didn't hold it up I think you'd be constantly running over it.",3

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money,the United States,14-Jul-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is the most unfortunate purchase I have made in years.  There is no suction when vacuuming, the water keeps leaking out the front even if you've pulled out the water source, and the vacuum opening cloggs with dirt very easily.

cris,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best thing ever!,the United States,7-Feb-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Life saver. Every one with more that a couple square feet of hard surface floor should have one.

Laurel J Linnemeier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing suction and scrubbing capabilities,the United States,5-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Just got my Crosswave delivered this morning, was able to track its shipping progress so purposely stopped scrubbing the floor each evening for the last 2 days.  I have a 4.5 month old puppy that brings the entire back garden in with her everytime she goes out.  The Crosswave was super simple to put together, love the storage tray (this is replacing my Hoover wet and dry vac that leaks all over the floor when not in use).  Turned the Crosswave on and it literally sucked all debris that was a foot away from it in from the start!  I took a single swipe on part of the floor to get a good before/after shot, and can see my days of scrubbing on hands and knees are hopefully going to be a thing of the past.  The device has distinct hard floor/carpet settings.  Very pleased and will review further after I have actively used the Crosswave more.",2

Rancho Guy 4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny tile floors and Drooling Dog - This does the trick.,the United States,26-Mar-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I keep my expectations low on floor cleaners.  I've had the Hoover counterpart to this, a ""star-mop"", a power scrubber, multi-purpose rug and floor cleaner, and Steam Mop.  This is as close to a cleaning miracle as one can get.  I have shiny tile floors and a dog that drools.  The dried drool is hard to get off.  This machine does it.  It is fantastic, not that hard to clean, easy to fill and empty and has a nice long cord.  Nothing else like it on the market.  I would but it again in a flash.  Also, it s rather well made for this price range with parts that snap confidently in, filters and gaskets where they are supposed to be, and it actually works!  I just go over my shiny floors and use either the floor or rug setting depending on the amount of dried dog drool and dirt.  Then the machine sucks up almost all the water leaving a lightly moist surface the dries fast.  If I want the surface to dry faster I just go over the damp area quickly with a dry ""star mop"" (available on amazon). and that's it - ready to walk on.... or drool on.",12
Kathleen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,28-Jun-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This is a great product.  I like the fact that I am cleaning with CLEAN water all the time.  As other reviews said, the worst part is clean up.  But that is not that difficult.",

Jacki Lee,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy with this product at all,the United States,17-Jun-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Not happy with this product at all.  Used it twice.

Slakkie,5.0 out of 5 stars,We have a Oreck vacuum and Orbiter for the carpeting upstairs but I have wanted something easy to use for the rest of the house,the United States,19-Nov-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This will be long.Downstairs our home is primarily wood, tile and area rugs.  We have a Oreck vacuum and Orbiter for the carpeting upstairs but I have wanted something easy to use for the rest of the house.  Did I mention I have dogs?  I show Australian Shepherds and they all live in the house they shed, sometimes a little sometimes a lot but they shed.I am constantly battling muddy paws, hair you name it.  Plus the humans as well.  While I am not a clean freak (I don't have the time) I do like my house clean.  I have a house cleaner that comes weekly to do the big stuff but one good rainstorm (or a good tug of war) and its all gone.  Yes this is long but I want to set the stage.  To be fair I prepped like normal (house cleaners had been here on Monday so it had been 5 days)  I bought all the various supplies and attachments.I started with my tile.  This room is where all my dogs and dog stuff resides.  I usually hand scrub the floor weekly with bleach or vinegar, then use a Swiffer to try to get the rest up.  Even after this it never feels clean.  I used the Bissell and was not impressed - it seemed too easy and so I was sure it did not work, then I reached down and felt the floor - NO GRIME.  In shock, I used the Swiffer afterwards and usually it takes 6-8 of the cleaning pads and this time I used one and there was barely anything.  It is now so convenient I used it again this morning.  Still easy still clean.  YES!Next up were my area rugs.  So it had been 5 days since vacuuming.  I vacuumed before then switched to the area rug brush.  Again, it was easy to use and since the rugs looked clean I was not really impressed until I went to change out the brush.  OMFG the hair and dirt that were buried in deep.  I have no words.  Again I have an industrial strength vaccum, I had just used it and I literally had to take a knife to pull the hair out of the brush (a 9 x 14 area rug and a 5 x8)  The dirt it pulled up was enough to make me want to vomit - again vacuumed twice in a week and still that full.  Still a big YES!Last were my hardwoods, again prepping like usually, a sweep then I vacuum (did I mention dog hair) then I used the Bissell with the hardwood brush.  We had just had a rain storm the night before and the dogs had brought in mud.  The mud was not match for the Bissell.  The floors cleaned incredibly fast.  The only thing I will say is I do not like the cleaning solution and will make my own with vinegar from now on.  I pulled the brush out and was again horrified at the amount of dirt and hair it found.  Because I do not like the solutions film I used my Swiffer to go around and usually for cleaning purposes I use 8 or so of the pads.  I used one and there was hardly anything on it.My floors look and feel clean, switching our brushes was easy.  I think if you wanted you could use the multi purpose brush only.  I think it does a great job.  It does not get right in corners but most do not.  If eel it was definitely worth the price.",9

RandK_G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For laminate, wood, tile, and area rugs, this thing is excellent!",the United States,30-Jul-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"We installed water-resistant laminate flooring all through our house. I found out about the CrossWave while we were installing the new flooring and purchased it from Amazon. We have been using it for about four months now and this is one of the best products I have used to clean my home with. Anything mess that I could have cleaned with a mop is handled as well or better with the Crosswave. Very sticky things like jam that dried on the floor will not come up with the Crosswave alone. I still have to get down and scrape it up, but I would have had to with a mop, so no issue there. A few stubborn stains or marks may take a few passes with the crosswave, but again, so would the mop. What makes the CrossWave so good is the time it saves you. Cleaning wise it is as good or better then a mop and bucket but it is easier to use and since it vacuums and mops at the same time, it save a lot of time. I can clean about 700 square feet (great room, kitchen, hallway, den, and one bedroom) in about 20 minute,s which includes setting up the crosswave, making the cleaning solution, and cleaning the crosswave when I am done.How good is it as a vacuum only, such as for hard floor or area rugs and carpet? Well. it is the best dry vacuum for hard floors I have ever used (you can dry vac without pulling the trigger to release cleaning fluid). It picks up all different sizes of particles and does not make the large one fly out of the vacuum like my traditional vacuum does. It also does a very good job dry vacuuming our area rugs. We have no carpet in our house, only several rugs. I still have my old carpet vacuum but I keep it only for the hose and attachments for cleaning things that you need a hose to reach.Do I have to use Bissell cleaning chemicals? Nope. We use vinegar and water as our cleaning solution with a few drops of essential oil for fragrance. We simple add about a 1/4 cup of white vinegar to the bottle and fill with hot tap water. It works great on the laminate floor and I even use it on the area rugs (tested each rug first to make sure it was safe and all mine are). I did try the Bissell cleaning chemicals and they work well, but they are expensive. A gallon of white vinegar is about $4.00 and lasts all year or more. Buy a few essential oils like lemon or pine for about $5 to $10 each and those last us about a year too.Only things I do not like about the CrossWave is that the cord is too short and could be about 10 feet longer (easily fixed with an short extension cord). The waste water take is a little small and sometime I have to empty it before the cleaning solution tank is empty (especially if I have to tilt the handle low to get under something). I wish it had a hose and hose attachments so I could replace my old traditional vacuum. The last wish would be a cordless version!One note: The difference between the floor and rug settings is that the rug setting puts out twice the cleaning solution then the floor setting. If you have a hard to clean spot on your hard floor, use the rug setting to get it wetter with more cleaning solution.",One

I really love this product! We have 2 dogs and family of 4 bringing in dirt and this really  makes cleaning up faster.

If you have a wet mess or loose dirt or dust on the surface this may work for you.  If you plan to use this weekly to maintain the cleanliness of your floor this may work as well.

I have tried swiffer's, regular mops, steam mops and good old fashioned elbow grease.  This is fantastic! It was SOO easy to put together and it vacuums, so I don't have to vacuum before hand!! For really tough stains (e.g., I had some gummy kinda stuff on the floor, it didn't clean it, but I think that is true of most any mop/cleaner.  It did a FANTASTIC job on my WHITE tile floors!  I also have a PUG and she sheds 24/7 and this picked up all of her dog fur, along w/the sandy grit from the bottom of my shoes.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone... you do not have to constantly replace the pad, like you do with a swiffer or even a steam mop.  SOO easy to remove the roller and let it dry.  I know some people were complaining about it not getting to the (edge) of a wall, but what machine does?  My steam mop would only push the dirt further into the edge of the wall.  This gets as close as possible and I for one and not complaining about that.",25

It does take a little longer to use then a mop- only because I go over them to try and get them dry too.  Easy set up, easy clean up.  So far- I am VERY happy with this purchase!",5

The product is very heavy and hard to lug around 2.  The spray mechanism is located directly below where your hand holds the sweeper so there is a tendency to inadvertently press the sprayer  3.  The sweeper does not easily fit underneath furniture 4.  It is OK as a dry sweeper but useless as a wet mop sweep - the floor became streaked and dull and dirty.  5.  It is a mess to clean this thing and there is absolutely no time saved which is why I bought it.  If anything, it took longer to clean the floors.  6.  I got a blister on my hand from holding the thing  7.  The cord is too short and gets caught up when sweeping.",3

The second one doesn't seem to suck up as much water as it puts down but it does still dry quickly. I have tile and engineered hardwood throughout. It does great for muddy paw prints , dog hair , grass , and light dirt , but forget stuck on baby lunch time messes. You can hold the spinner bar part over a dried mandarin orange for 5 minutes and it still won't scrub it off of the floor. I am still within my return window and heavily debating returning this second machine. It's also very very loud and has a high pitch whine.",2

Lisa B,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your time!!,the United States,20-Sep-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So as a mother of a young child and a homeowner with hard flooring constantly covered in crumbs and spilled goo, I thought this device would be a life saver. Boy was I so wrong.The vacuum part works ok. Nothing special. Works average at best and produces the most god awful sound while on (the vacuum part actually won't turn off while in use).As for the scrubbing portion - what a joke. It literally took 15 passes over most spots to gets the dirt to lift. I swear the cleaning solution is just meant to freshen the air. Don't dissolve any dirt. And the brush head itself is worthless. Not to mention the cheap plastic/rubber bristles in the mop head marked up my floors!!!In short, this device leaks all over the place, left streaks, marked up my floors, makes a ton of noise, and is weak when it comes to removing the crust, goo, and scuffs of normal every day life.I wanted to love crosswave, but it's just an overpriced piece of junk and I retuned it after one use.

Olivia Walls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissel Crosswave,the United States,21-Mar-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased my crosswasve just about a month ago. Ive used it at least once a week and i completely LOVE it!. My house is roughly 1700 square feet of stained concrete; when I purchased it I saw no reviews for homes with that type of flooring and I wanted to give my input. My floors have never looked better, every time i use it I am amazed at what it pulls off my floor. I have a roomba that goes off daily and a 110 pend german shepard-so my flooring puts the cross wave to the test. It is very light weight and easy to clean. The sample size cleaner that it comes with lasted me only 2 uses-then I had to purchase more, the cleaner has a light floral smell-nothing strong. I do use only the ""rug"" button because I find that it cleans the stained concrete better. Before I bought it I was concerned that the cord would be short and the cord actually is pretty long.",17
JB shopper,3.0 out of 5 stars,Solution won’t dispense on right side,the United States,13-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get my Bissell CrossWave, but now I’m a bit disappointed. After reading all the reviews I thought it would be great.  And it is, but mine seems to only dispense solution from the left side of the sweeper head.  You can see the solution going through the clear tubing on the left side, and I can see that the floor on that side is getting wet.  But on the right side, I only see what appears to be bubbles going through the clear tubing. And nothing seems to be dispensing on the floor on the right side.  So I’m very disappointed.  I can still clean my floor but I have to make several swipes in one area to get the solution dispensed evenly.",One

stephen newmark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell beats Hoover in a Landslide,the United States,7-Jan-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this machine when my 1 1/2 year old Hoover floormate bit the dust.  I thought I would change because I was not totally happy with the Hoover but I would have given it an average rating.  I was going to say that by comparison this machine is great but that really would not do it justice.  Let me just say that they are not the same things.  The Bissell is better in every way.  The assembly only requires that you push the handle into place and fill and snap in the solution bottle.  The refill bottle is much easier to install and remove than the one on the Hoover.  The rug/floor button is right where it should be on the handle.  No searching around for a little rubber encased button that is difficult to depress.  No green brushes that fall off every-time you try to clean the machine.  This little machine does wonders.  I am using it on a 2350 sq ft. tile house that includes three dogs.  This is like an every other day thing for me. No need to vacuum first which is a huge plus.  Really, I could go on and on but at the end I will only say that I do not understand how Bissell could have gotten so far ahead of Hoover.  The last time I felt this way was when I purchased a Lexus back in 1991.  I just don't get it.",23

Suzanne,4.0 out of 5 stars,It does the trick.,the United States,7-Apr-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I recently bought a new home with all hardwood floors on the first level. I bought the CrossWave because I did not want to lug my heavy vacuum cleaner up and down the steps just to vacuum 3 area rugs. I also wanted something to safely vacuum my hardwood floors. I read the reviews before ordering. I was pleased overall with the performance of this machine. I like that I can wet/clean the hardwood areas and then switch to vacuuming the carpet to complete cleaning one room quickly.I have a largish furry dog and two cats and I think this does a good job picking up the fur and associated dust bunnies. Having the water feature was a bonus for me. I also agree that a good old bucket of hot water with Murphy's Oil soap and getting down on my hands and knees with a wet cloth is the best way to clean a hardwood floor, but this does help with the maintenance in between.",4

Paul Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t manhandle this gem,the United States,29-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,Ok so to some this review will seem a little strange but I wanted to write something because I feel like there are a lot of people out there like me that need to know. I got my Bissell crosswave after weeks of research online. I wanted to make sure if I was going to drop that amount of money it would be worth it. I am ultimately glad I got it and it came just as expected. I do however want to put this advice out there to others that clean their homes with this. This machine does NOT like to be manhandeled. What does this mean you ask... well I was so used to pushing around a big heavy Dyson vacuum and whipping through my house with a big industrial mop that I had to push and pull with the strength of an elephant. This mechine needs a soft touch and that is how you will get the best results. The first time I used my Bissell I was pushing and pulling and could t figure out why the spots on my floor were not coming up. I went through and made the same mistake 3 different times unsatisfied with the results and the way my floor looked after. I then decided that it was clearly my fault and tried a different approach. I SLOWED down and barley held on to the handle and the damn thing started working like a champ. Apparently I was so rough that the Roll pad was not sitting on the floor all the way and that is why stuff was not coming off the floor. If you just be easy with it and let it do what it needs to do then it works fantastic. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone I know 😊,18

The vacuum system is excellent, it is a pain to clean, but definitely shows it is picking up dirt.  The problem is it we did not care for the roller system in picking up residual water and leaving the floor without streaks when drying, we still had to use a mop type device for finishing.

This morning our housekeeper swept and mopped a guest bedroom. As a test, I followed up with the Bissell CrossWave using only hot tap water, no cleaning formula. We were truly amazed at how dirty the water was when we emptied the reservoir from just this one room. Our floors have never been cleaner! We need an edging tool as you can see along the walls about a one inch wide dirty strip that stands out against the adjacent clean floor.Due to our tropical climate in Panama we do not have carpet or area rugs so I cannot comment on how the machine does on rugs, but on tile, it is fantastic. We are delighted with the CrossWave and highly recommend it to anyone with tile floors.",12

In fact, I think this product does a much better job than the swiffer.However, if you're expecting it to scrub floors (ie sticky stuff, mashed food particles etc) it won't. It does a good job as a daily, quick clean of your floors, but it won't replace an appliance or good ol' elbow grease when it comes to actually scrubbing floors.We got it just for the fact that we'd usually do the broom / dustpan + swiffer 2x a week. The CrossWave does a better job in that use case.",7

Shane L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hardwood helper,the United States,13-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Great great great for hardwood, tile, or any other hard surface.  You don't have to worry about sweeping and then mopping, you can just go with it and you're good so it saves a ton of time.  The downside is on area rugs; it doesn't really do well on that and I do still have to use my normal vacuum.  The other downside it that it doesn't clean all the way up to your wall so there's about an inch around the outside of the room that won't get cleaned by this machine.  Overall I like it, if it did better on area rugs and carpet I would love it but you can't have everything right?  First world problems. =)",

Christine Bailey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,the United States,9-Apr-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have lived in a home with hard floors for 25 years and have just about tried every cleaning tool known to man. I decided to up my game when I saw my sister using the Oreck Orbiter on her tile and had it in my cart for weeks while I checked out other tools. My main concern was my area rugs with a puppy pee smell and I just wasn't sold on the Oreck for that.I changed my mind at the last minute after talking to my daughter, who told me that the wives living on her base were all raving about this Bissel. The cost was better than the Oreck and I loved that it specifically referenced Area rugs.I ordered one from Amazon Warehouse and you would never know it wasn't brand new. Assembly was super easy, the design is very intuitive. I cleaned the area rugs first and then moved to linoleum and tile. This was easy to use, you need to do a slower pass than vacuuming for a good clean, and rinsing the dirty water between each floor type was quick and easy.I have since ordered the area rug brush and dog accident cleaning solution to keep on hand.Bottom line - I feel like I have stumbled on the Holy Grail of floor cleaning machines. The floors feel so clean on my feet and I'm no longer worried about grandbabies crawling around or how to keep my area rugs clean. (Pee smell is gone!!)",9

JO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes-- this is a good machine that does a good job,the United States,15-Jan-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I've waited to review the machine because I wanted to give it an opportunity to disappoint me. So far, it has been great! I follow the manufacturer's recs on cleaning it and leaving the parts out to dry. I don't find the care/ set up/ clean up to be a big issue the way other reviewers have mentioned. I think it's super easy to use and does a fantastic job for a machine. The only way to get your floors truly sparkling clean, I think, is to go old school and scrub them by hand-- a machine can't get the edges of a floor (although this one comes darn close!). That said, I would prefer to do so many other things other than cleaning my floors by hand...!In summary, I am super happy with this machine. It is easy to use. It is easy take apart & clean. It leaves my floors very clean. I would buy it again.",21

Does a fairly good job of cleaning for me. (I am only person in house)  The only inconvenience is taking everything out to clean, as the brush really cannot be cleaned in that little tray...especially if you have a dog like I do; however, it does come clean in the sink.  The rest of the parts are easy to clean.  Also, have to let all parts dry before reassembling them.  Don't like the odor of the cleaning solution.  Swiffer makes a great smelling product; Bissell's does not 'smell' clean.",14

Running a light cloth over them does not clean. They need light water and s little scrubbing.  Enter the Bissell Crosswave. Perfect solution.It allows me to run enough water to get the dirt up, scrubs the floor, then I can run it over same area to suck up excess water.It does have to be cleaned after each use.The good news is, it is easy and actually possible to get it completely clean. No little alcoves for dirt and hair to get stuck.It had good suction, great job getting dog hair up.I do not, however, use it to sweep if there is a lot of hair,, in that case I will sweep first. Not because it won't do it, just because that much wet hair grosses me out. Sincecrosswave is easy to use, i do every two or three days which keeps amount of hair down and I don't have to pre-sweep.First time I've had really clean floors since I got the dogs!Good job Bissell!",8

Daphne,1.0 out of 5 stars,This machine does NOT deserve the good ratings,the United States,31-Oct-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"After reading all the glowing reviews on this product I decided to buy the Bissell CrossWave.  The intention was to replace my 10+ year old Hoover floor cleaner that is starting to have issues.I do not understand the 4 and 5 star reviews this machine received.  It is cheaply made and simply does NOT work.  I first used it to try and clean a spot on an area rug where a cat had thrown up a hairball.  I cleaned the area so nothing was left but what was soaked in.  Not only did this machine NOT clean the spot after going over it multiple times it also bunched up any cat hair that was on the rug and left it in wet clumps that I had to clean up afterwards.  Next I tried it on a similar spot on my tile floor.  Same results, after going over the same spot multiple times there was no difference, it was like the roller wasn't touching the floor.  Not only was the original dirty spot still there now I had puddles of water the machine just pushed around.I ended up having to get my old Hoover cleaner and clean those areas, which it did in no time without leaving clumps of wet cat hair on the rug or puddles of water on the floor.I am going to return this product and keep looking.",5

I have always believed that the best way to clean the floors is on your hands and knees.  Getting to an age where this is becoming troublesome, I decided to purchase this product (I have two other Bissell cleaners as well).  Having hard wood floors throughout the house and two dogs, the floors get pretty messy.  The CrossWave has made the cleaning process easier.  It is easy to handle and seems to do a good job.  Sometimes I have to go over heavy traffic areas a couple of times but its easier than using a mop and bucket.  I did not find the clean up process for the machine to be any big deal.  You just have to clean up the different parts.  I would highly recommend this product.",12

And actually more hassle than a mop having to go over a spot many more times, cleaning all the tanks, flushing the plumbing and pump, removing rinsing drying brush, cleaning out the brush housing. I'd rather just dump a mop bucket and be done.Less than 24 hours and the hard floor power button doesn't work. Will turn on with area rug button.Biggest design flaw is that it can't get within 1.5 inches of wall unless you go at it perpendicular.

If your house is clean, this will do a fine job on small daily messes.  If your house isn't clean, this will do a barely adequate job.  When I got this, it had been raining daily and the cats and the hubby going in and out in the rain and mud...my house floors weren't clean.  I thought it did a great job, till I kicked the cat's water dish, and had to use a towel to wipe it up and the clean towel came up dirty.  Th good? Wow, it does vacuum the heck out of the solution, picking up kibble and hair.  However...it's SO LOUD!!!  It needs a light on the floor so you can see.  Other negative?  There's no way to not have to take this apart to clean it, and if you don't, it will smell.  I tried to use this as a vacuum alone...meh.  Frankly, it's just easier to use a mop and bucket, and it does a better job.  Especially if you have a washable mop head....",5

VMR,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must Have,the United States,1-Dec-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,I ordered this Bissell Crosswave for our vacation home after owning one for several months.  I have a vacuum sweeper and a steam mop but those two items just weren't completing the job.  The Crosswave does a great job on the hard floors including the hardwood floors.  It is easy to use and comes apart for cleaning.  It is amazing as a spot cleaner for the heavy traffic areas.  It cleaned up cat vomit as though it had never been there and left the floor smelling fresh.  I even used this on our filthy basement floors (spot cleaning) and was pleasantly surprised.  This small unit will clean carpet but you'll have to empty the dirty water and add fresh cleaner and water often.,

Lisa K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fabulous, must have little machine!!",the United States,25-Feb-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"TIP: I use a mesh bag to put all my clean parts in to dry, this keeps them out of the way and prevents them from getting misplaced.  I just hang it up and the parts are dry and ready to go for the next time.This is a fantastic machine!  I have a scooba (washing robot) and I thought I loved it, but even though this may actually be a little more work I know I got every spot.  The scooba could not be left unattended.  If it got stuck, which it did often, you had no way of knowing if it happen before or after it had done most of the cleaning.  I would bump into tables and knock trinkets and even lamps off.  With the Crosswave you just have better control.  The suction it very powerful, you can feel it suctioning to the floor as you slowly push or pull it.  It leaves the floor as dry or dryer than a mop.  It cleans 1000 times better than a mop because it is always cleaning with clean water.  I just love it!!!!Now, it's not perfect, just pretty darn close.  The few cons are not deal breakers for me, just a little annoying 1. It will not go under things very well.  Like under the bed, when you lay it all the way back to go under, the front end (the brush and suction part) kicks up.  So you can run it up and under the bed but you're not really cleaning anything, so you will have to hit these areas with a swiffer and/wet mop every now and then.  2. The on/off button seems to be in a bad spot, I keep accidentally turning it off.  3.  There is a bit of set up to get started and then some cleaning of the parts at the end, which makes it not so easy to just grab and use on a quick spot or spill.  I only use this when it's time to vacuum and mop the whole room or whole house. Tip: I use a mesh bag to put all my clean parts in to dry, this keeps them out of the way and prevents them from getting misplaced.  I just hang it up and the parts are dry and ready to go for the next time.  4. It doesn't eliminate the need for a regular vacuum or a mop, there will be times and areas that you will still need these.  ie: anything you would need to use the vacuum attachments and for quick jobs.",3

mojosharkey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do Not Doubt!,the United States,22-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"It is hard to believe, but this multi-surface Cleaner actually works great!  I live in a condo and so had no reason to keep the big rug cleaning machine I used to have for my big house.  Because I gave it away, I needed to rent a machine from time to time....costly, heavy, sloppy, and did carpets only.  I wanted the convenience of having my machine handy...and it cleans hardwood and tile too?...hard to believe.  But believe it!Once the machine was set up and I understood it, I began.  Lo and behold, I could roll out of the marble floored bath, onto the dressing room carpet and clean with only the press of a different button!  Then onto the hardwoods!  Another button change back.  Amazing.  It uses just enough multi-surface solution on the hard floors to clean without ""wetting"" the surface too much.  It is as if you were carefully handwiping.  A second pass without spraying helps the floor dry really quickly!  The carpets dried quickly too.  I cleaned every part of my floors in less time and with less trouble than with a dedicated commercial rug cleaning machine.  Much lighter too.  Another surprise is that the vacuum is powerful.  You are NOT supposed to use it as a vacuum cleaner, but it works as you wash the carpets, etc.  Too be sure, I vacuumed all my floors before beginning, although they say it is not required.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the dirt bin and found a big ball of dust and hair!  Embarrassing, but gratifying too.  This thing really works!!  Do not doubt.",2

I have a wool rug that's shedding a lot, and all it just pushed the fuzz around the rug instead of sucking it.2) Related to the fact that it's not a vacuum, it doesn't come with any accessories for vacuuming something other than the floor. You can't vacuum anything narrow or upholstery or anything that's not on the floor.3) As a floor cleaner, it sucks. What it does:  It sprays water on the floor and then spreads it around. It absorbs some back, but it's not even strong enough to suck the water from in between hardwood floor ridges. You have to pass the vacuum over the same area over and over for the water to be sucked back I to the vacuum.4) It also doesn't scrub. All the spots on my kitchen tile such as dried food spilled by kids are still there. All the black spots from dirty shoes on the hallway tile are also still there.5) You have to take it apart and wash it every single time. There's 6 plastic pieces that need washing and a brush. Every single time.6) It's super heavy.So, if you need a vacuum, don't buy. If you need something to wash hard floor, it doesn't clean better than a regular wet mop. Why pay over $200 when a microfiber mop is $20 or  I a floor steamer is under $100? Ifou need a carpet or rug washer, then maybe (I did clean a shaggy rug that doesn't shed and it looks a tad whiter).I'm begging Amazon to let me return this.Here's a photo of a wet paper towel I rubbed on my tile after I ""cleaned"" it with this machine.",351

Of course getting into corners and the area around the toilet do require some additional attention. Doesn't matter though because it has already cut your mopping time by half. I have dogs and this thing sucks up dog hair along with the dirt. Just finished putting up a tile backsplash which involved a lot of cuts done in the house because pieces were to small to use the tile saw. I have porcelain dust every where. No problem for the CrossWave. It seems to take everything in stride. Cleaning it is a bit of a challenge.

Then I scrubbed on hands and knees with a sponge to see how well it did. My sponge and water, which I usually refresh several times for the kitchen floor, was nearly clear after re-cleaning the entire area. For that I was very impressed. It did leave streaks in places, which is why I didn't give it 4 stars. But getting it clean is more important to me than streaks, so I'm happy enough. And it didn't get the very edges of the floor, so I had to clean that separately.I felt the cleanup of the machine was easy, but a little frustrating to have to leave everything out to dry for so long. It makes it less desirable to me for quick clean-ups, but it's terrific for the big jobs.This machine is much better thought out than many. Super easy to install, easy to take out the parts for filling and cleaning, easy to hold the buttons and push the machine (though I wish there was a 'hold' button for the trigger, since it's being held most of the time). I rarely felt the need to use the suction-only feature to dry the floor (really only after an area that had been really dirty), and combined with the awesome vacuum feature, it was quick overall.I don't plan to use this as a carpet vaccume. It's not an all in one machine from my perspective. But it's a great hard floor vacuum, saving a step in the mopping process!",9

Emma,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not going to replace your mop and vacuum.,the United States,16-Jan-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So for all you ladies and gentlemen coming over from the Laundry, Love and Science FB group looking for the scoop on this all the rave popular crosswave item, let me give you the inside scoop. As a member of the group, I was psyched about this item. I hate having to vacuum and then mop and then possibly do some steam mopping too.  It takes a lot of time and lets face it, who doesn't like to knock out two chores with one task? The shark vacuum craze proved to be well worth it, I love my shark rotator and I love my shark steam mop and I love my spin mop. Well, why not try the cross wave since it was gaining huge popularity right now...well here's why you should wait until it either drops in price or they upgrade it to a newer model (or why you should just try the hoover floor mate or stick to your vacuum and mop). It may be good for ""quick trips"" across your floor when you spill a dish of something or when you just need a quick clean. This is not at all good for deep cleans. Im still using my vacuum and mop after I use this (therefore, I don't really see it as doing it's job).** will update with photos and videos after three months of owning this to see if it improves.10 things I dislike about the crosswave:1) The brush isn't big enough. When I'm using it, it seems to take forever because the brush just doesn't cover a wide enough area. I just see two tracks from the ends of the brush leaving soap marks.2) The cleaning/drying process is a pain. You will get dirty. Use a garbage disposal side of your sink or a garbage can. It will be messy and you will have to use a cloth or paper towel to get the rest of the machine cleaned out. Then you have to leave the parts out to dry for at least two days.3) It doesn't get up most spots on my floor. I still need to go over my floor with my steam mop or my regular mop.4) The solution it comes with leaves my floor feeling sticky and not really ""clean"". Im experimenting with just water/other solutions. I just don't like a residue on my floors.5) The buttons are annoying in placement. I keep hitting the carpet button or the ""soap"" button by accident when Im not trying to simply because they are all on the handle.6) It doesn't replace my vacuum either, it still misses a ton of small debris on my floor.7) It is actually heavier than I expected. It's a pain to lug up and down stairs.8) Forget getting close to your walls, under cabinets or close to your baseboards, it's not happening.9) Its SO LOUD. I think it's louder than my shark vacuum. It is not something you're going to do when the kids are watching tv thats for sure. You can't really hear much else when you run this thing.10) The price tag. Its not cheap and definitely not worth the price. If it were $100 cheaper, I'd say maybe.And as a bonus disadvantage for me, I live in an old house with very few three prong plug outlets and of course this bad boy has a three prong plug. I have to stretch across a few rooms to plug it in.I have tried this item on hard wood floors, carpets, tile and linoleum. And on my unfinished hard wood floors to just give it a shot.Some tips if you actually do decide to buy it after this review:- Don't put a lot of cleaning solution/water in to start. Use the ""small area"" level. I have a huge house and I never use up all the water/solution.- Vacuum with your regular vacuum first. It just saves you trouble.",39
Donna I.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!!,the United States,6-Dec-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This Bissell Crosswave all-in-one is awesome! It cleans our tile floors without streaking or leaving residue. No need to sweep or swifter first with this puppy. I use the term puppy because it is small, light weight and convenient and easy to clean. Spot cleaning and overall carpet cleaning is pretty impressive. I do believe for deep down carpet cleaning a beefier machine would work better, but this machine is great for sprucing up the carpets and for quick spot cleaning. I would highly recommend this machine for general household cleaning.Mike, Phoenix AZ",4

That being said I did have an issue.  I used it once and then it wouldn't turn on.  I contacted Customer Service who instructed me to turn it on and gave me a few other ridiculous suggestions.  You can say I wasn't impressed.  I asked Customer Service what the next step was and they informed me that I would need to send the CrossWave in to have a technician look at it.  Thankfully, before sending it in, I looked over the renews and found my answer.  ""If the handle is pulled up to its highest position, the machine will not turn on -- you must press down on the handle until you hear a click"" and this fixed the machine.  I'm disappointed that their Customer Service didn't suggest this as a solution.",10

Roy,4.0 out of 5 stars,My floors are finally clean.  A couple small improvements needed.,the United States,3-Jan-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Overall I'm glad we bought this to clean the hardwood and tile floors throughout our apartment. It cleans very well.Some details:- The floor looks shiny and spotless after using this!- We've used it on the kitchen tiles, bathroom tiles and the hardwood floors in the living room and bedrooms.  It gets any visible dirt off and leaves the floors looking perfect.- The machine is easy to use, but requires a couple extra steps compared to a vacuum: filling up the upper tank with soap and water before use, emptying the lower tank after use and cleaning out the brush and filters.- Since I don't want the hardwood floors to get saturated with water, I usually go over each area in multiple passes pressing the spray trigger only for the first pass.  That way it gets wet with soap and water on the initial pass and the subsequent passes allow the brushes to really scrub the dirt off and suck as much of the water up as possible.- I almost always clean the floors first with a regular vacuum to get all the dust and dirt up before using the Bissel Crosswave.  That might not be necessary, but seems to allow each machine to do what it is best at.- The most rewarding part of using the machine is emptying the lower tank afterwards.  That's where the dirty water is collected after scrubbing the floor.  Every single time I empty that tank it is full of filthy black water.  Feels great to see that and know I made the floor so much cleaner.Three minor design issues:- The on/off buttons are on the handle in a location where I find myself accidentally turning the machine off as I'm using it.  It's a minor annoyance.- The machine bends back at the base for usage.  However, if you try to recline the machine significantly in order to reach under furniture, the bottom of the machine has a tendency to lift up and spray water.  Again, also a minor annoyance that I've learned to avoid.- The brush head doesn't extend all the way to the sides of course.  So it can't clean all the way to the side wall.  I'm starting to see a roughly 1/2 inch band of dirt on the edge of the floor along the walls where the machine can't clean.Overall: Best way I know to clean the floors.  Hopefully Bissell perfects it further when they create an updated model.",18

SA Workman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with my Bissell,the United States,4-May-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this tool. My older dog recently had a surgery on his hip, a location we couldn't keep a bandage on. I had dog towels and sheets covering the rugs but it wasn't keeping the wound discharge from getting on my carpets in the areas he laid.I was amazed what this little powerful machine does, moving from hardwood/ tile to carpet cleaning with just the switch of a button. It is so lightweight compared to carpet cleaners I've used before, easy to maneuver and gets closer to the corners/ walls then I thought it would.I still use my Bissell vacuum BEFORE I use the CrossWave, I don't think it is a true replacement for a regular vacuum in my situation.Just astonished on how much it picks up and just how dirty the water becomes --- almost like a sludge. I found that my carpets were not very wet to the touch and dried quickly which was a concern as my area rugs are on hardwood floors. Pervious carpet cleaners I've had to find a place to move the carpets while cleaning and drying as to not damage the hardwood. This is much easier and quicker.While this tool does require a little attention before you're finished - disassembly, rinsing/ cleaning the parts and letting them air dry- after the first couple times its easy and ready to your next use.  I found a matching green mesh laundry bag to keep the drying parts together- looks like it came with the product.  Thank you Bissell !",7

The first cleaning of the machine was difficult as their are so many parts to clean.  I gave it a 4 because one of the area's to clean, I needed to use a knife and my fingers to pull out all the hair that was stuck in it.  Did finally get it all out.

After 2 years of vacuuming first then still having to mop, the Bissel Crosswave is a Godsend!  Hitting 2 birds with 1 stone is always a plus in my life.  *I will note that I still used my vacuum for a few areas that had accumulated quite a bit of furry clumps.*  My one and only gripe is about the size of both the dirty water tank and the clean water tank.  It took 3 clean tank refills, and 4 dirty tank dumps to finally finish the job (which was only half the house).  Both were easy to do but it was just annoying to have to stop so frequently.

(I use multi-purpose cleaner on rugs, bathrooms, and laundry room.) I particularly like that the floors and rugs aren't completely saturated. They are almost dry after one additional pass of the machine. I thought my floors were clean, but after using my CrossWave I realize that I was kidding myself. Great product!",3

I've had steam ""mops"" that didn't come close to what this little machine will do.  You don't even have to sweep before you mop.  Just pour warm water and cleaning solution into the water tank, plug it in and start it.  It works perfectly.  I used it today on my tile floors.  Could not be happier!  It was so easy and quick.  If you have something that is really hard and dried on, you might pre-treat it, but for your usual cleaning jobs definitely not required.",49

ILENE M WATSON,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for people with pets!,the United States,20-Nov-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I stumbled on the infomercial for this last week and have been obsessed with it ever since.  I finally convinced my husband to order one and it got here today.  We are a family with three kids, two dogs, and two cats (one with long hair), and sweeping and mopping the floors in our house is my least favorite job.  I had been sweeping with a brook or using a stick vac and then using a spin mop and it took FOREVER.  I seriously just cleaned all the floors in my house less than half the time it would normally take me, and I'm not exhausted after!  The floors are so clean and absolutely streak-free, which is amazing for these aging laminate floors.  I did clean one area rug and it looks great and smells so much better!  The only thing I don't care for is that there is about an inch gap between where the machine cleans and the edge of the baseboard, so you will periodically need to go through and clean the edges with another method.  But for quick clean-ups, especially ones that involve pets and/or pet hair, this thing is a lifesaver.  I can't believe how much dirt it got up from the floors!  Clean up was a breeze.  Just be sure that you dump the dirty water outside or in the toilet if you have pets as it had quite a bit of hair in it and you wouldn't want that in your drains.  I would also recommend ordering the larger bottle of the all-surface cleaner as the one you get in the box is pretty small.  All in all incredibly happy with my purchase and would recommend this to all of my friends, but especially the ones who hate to mop!Edited to add:  My 16-year-old cat had a major diarrhea episode in the dining room.  This thing cleaned it up super fast, without touching the mess and without using paper towels.  That in and of itself is worth the purchase price.  Once I soak all the parts in hot, soapy water, it's as good as new and ready to be used the next time a major spill comes my way.  Have had it a few weeks now and love it even more!",48

Edith Casique,5.0 out of 5 stars,"2 Kids, 3 Dogs, & A Messy Husband",the United States,15-Mar-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"In my home, spills and fur are unavoidable. I ordered this on a Saturday and decided to only clean up big spills. Until the Crosswave came in. Due to a few inches of snow, even with Prime, it came in on Wednesday evening. I have 2 small children who are ALWAYS spilling milk, water, juice, food, snacks and more. We have oil splatter from trying, and coffee grounds. And 3 short hair dogs that all shed. And though you wouldn't think they shed this much, they DO. Even I didn't think it was this bad.I have never been so excited to clean. And when I saw what this picked up, I was simply amazed.I own 3 different hardwood mops. And a swiffer, and a broom. And no matter how much I swept and cleaned I never felt like my floors were truly clean. They still looked dingy and stained. But, one pass with the Crosswave and a few on the nasty spots and my floors are as clean as when they were first installed.I'm so very happy with my Crosswave. My mother will be getting one next. Definitely worth the investment.",31

mg New York,2.0 out of 5 stars,Crosswave vs Floormate - a knockout for Crosswave - when it works,the United States,27-Nov-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I am going to review this  but also compare it to theHoover Hardwood Floor Cleaner FloorMate Deluxe Corded Bare Floor Cleaner with Foldable Handle FH40165CrosswaveThis review is for hard floors onlyComparatively light and easy to maneuver - pivot head.  It is not a super light dyson but I am on the older side and have mild arthritis and I can manage to do my apartment (with a break !)It does do a better job than a swifter or mop, and all in all it is faster than a mop.  It IS faster that doing a vacuum and then mop for sure.  If I keep up with a swifter during the week on the weekends I do a good clean.  The cross wave did an ok job picking up a stray leaves (it is autumn now) and I didn't have to dust first.It does leave the floor streakyIt doesn't get all the way to the edgesThere is some cleanup, but  not more than with a mop - and I would say the Crosswave cleanup is less onerous than the mop (or the Floormate for that matter).Comparison to Hoover Hardwood Floor Cleaner FloorMate Deluxe Corded Bare Floor Cleaner with Foldable Handle FH40165The Floormate is a beast- it ways a ton and is very hard to push.  Crosswave wins in this categoryThe floor mate did a better job on textured tile, but neither will replace a scrub brushFloormate leaks dirty water.  Crosswave does a little also but Crosswave wins hereCrosswave is easier to clean afterOn a pretty clean floor Floormate did a slightly better job cleaning, but without first sweeping and vacuuming, Crosswave did an overall better job.

Two teenage boys and three dogs with a pool = continuous dirt.  Have had my Crosswave for awhile now. The vacuum feature is fantastic for dog hair. I find if I don't constantly stop and rinse the roller it leaves puddles of dirty water everywhere.  If you don't go very very slowly it doesn't clean at all.  Also be sure to contact it every time you use it.  I forgot and when I went to use it again it smelled like three dead dogs and two dead teenage boys.  At this point I give up.  Not worth getting price.  A spray mop works better for cleaning.  Would not buy again.,4

S. Fowler,5.0 out of 5 stars,I *love* this machine!! (EDIT. Great for laminate and linoleum. HORRIBLE with tile and grout!),the United States,28-Nov-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This floor cleaner is insane!!I hadn't cleaned the kitchen floor since the day before Thanksgiving, so it was already bad from the long weekend.But I woke up this morning to an absolute disaster. I have no idea what happened. Maybe my husband dropped his pecan pie - the whole pie - and didn't have time to clean up before work. Maybe the cat knocked a pie - a whole pie - onto the floor after hubby left for work. Maybe a ghost tried to help himself to a slice and the pie slipped through his ghosty fingers. Frankly, I was baffled.I stepped over the piles of pie crust and pecans and made myself a cup of coffee. Much too blurry to cope with that mess at the moment.As I was leaving the kitchen I heard a knock on the door. UPS dropping off packages.I clutched my robe around my body as best as I could and dragged the boxes in. One of them was the crosswave that I ordered on Saturday. (SUPER fast shipping)After dumping two cups of caffeine down my throat, I decided that I was awake enough to tackle the hell that I'd been avoiding. I decided to break in the crosswave big time.Assembly consisted of pushing the handle in until I heard a click. I'd watched enough YouTube videos on the cleaner that I was pretty confident about the operation. I turned it on, wet the brush, and went to town.Plunged that sucker right into pie.One pass and there was no more pie.I cleaned my entire kitchen floor in five minutes. It was actually drier than when I hand wash. Moved it into the back room and took care of the area around the litter box.It took care of EVERYTHING. The dried coffee drips.The freakin' pie mess. The scattered litter. Dirt, crumbs, the dried splatter of candied yams, the gravy splotch. Some of it took two or three passes, but I was asking a LOT out of this machine.It got much closer to the edge than I thought it would, but I can see that I will have to give it a swipe every once in awhile by hand. The foot swivels enough that it's really easy to maneuver. It didn't use as much water and cleaner as I thought it would. Not even close.People complain about the noise, but it wasn't as loud as my vacuum. My cats were curious and weren't afraid.This thing is a miracle of modern engineering. I will never live without this in my house. I will actually use this every day. BEST money that I've ever spent.What a time to be alive!!If anyone is interested, I've discovered the vacuum's limits. (Well, where the machine begins to struggle)It's two smashed eggs, 1 cup of ketchup, and 1/2 cup of mayo. (I kept upping the ante until there was a slight problem)At that point, it took four passes. When I went to clean up the machine I had to use soap and water on the brush and the dirty water container. I also had to wipe out the part of the machine where the roller goes.Yeah. I'm having too much fun.But you should've seen my daughter's face when I made her smash an egg on the floor and it cleaned it up with one pass! Total shock! lol!EDIT: We moved into a bigger house with nearly 3000 sq ft of laminate. I couldn't live without my crosswave. I thought that it didn't edge well enough and that I'd have to go around the corners by hand every once in awhile, but the suction is so good that I'm not getting a buildup of dust or pet hair.Very short nap rugs... so awesome! Yes. I've used this to clean up cold cat puke and it didn't let me down. Better than dragging out the give carpet shampooer.But the two bathrooms have tile and that's not working out so well. It doesn't get proper suction. After 6 months, the grout looks so bad that I'm going to have to have a professional come in and clean the dirt out. And it is dirt. We have light grey grout and red dirt in our area. We now have red grout. smhI have a very  bad back and there's NO WAY that I could maintain my laminate without the crosswave. But this is not the answer for tile.Other minor issue. The cleaning solution doesn't leave the floors shiny. I'm not particular, but I know that will bug some other people. The good thing is that it doesn't leave a buildup. But it does look dull. (Yes, I've tried both multiuse and wood formulas)",60

I was impressed with the floor cleaning, and it looks like it does a much better job than just using a Swiffer Wet Jet. I did vacuum with a Dyson before using, but next time around I'll probably skip it. My only issue with this is, you do have to manually clean it after each use. I probably will only use it once a month instead of every week. It should have shipped with a full size bottle of cleaner, or multiple trial size bottles. I was able to clean my entire apartment by filling it up to the max level, I still have more than 50% of the trial size cleaner. I did have to empty the tank once about half way through.",12

Lisa,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't cut it,the United States,23-Dec-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Apparently we are too dirty for this vacuum. I was really excited about using this vacuum after reading all of the positive reviews. However, we live in the desert and have two dogs and two young boys. Therefore, our house gets very dusty and has lots of dog hair. By the second use, I found that this vacuum left a lot of dirt streaks and dog hair behind even though I had rinsed it thoroughly after the first use. In some areas, I was going over the same spot several times and it just felt like too much work. I think it would have worked okay if I had vacuumed the floors first with my regular vacuum, but then what would be the point of having an ""all-in-one"" vacuum if you have to vacuum before you use it?! I opted to return this vacuum and get a regular Bissell steam mop. Now I vacuum with my regular canister vacuum and then use the Bissell steam mop and this seems to be the best option for my grubby house!I also found the dirty tank of hairy water to be disgusting to empty. We have a fairly small house (about 1400 SF) and I would have to empty the dirty water and add clean water at least 3 times to get through the whole house. It seemed like a lot of walking back and forth to empty and rinse the dirty tank in my laundry room sink and it was seriously gross to have to separate out the dog hair from the dirty water so it didn't clog our drain.",32

Scott H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes the Hoover FloorMate look and feel like a Army Tank,the United States,18-Aug-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I just received this today.  I have a house that is almost entirety travertine tile. For the past year and a half, I've been using a Hoover FloorMate Deluxe.  The FloorMate was a great improvement over using a mop and I was very happy with it until recently when it just didn't seem want to suck up the dirty water as well as it once did.  So a quick search and I saw that Bissell was just releasing the Crosswave and I decided to give it a try despite it being substantially more expensive than the FloorMate.I'm a heavy user of this type of product because I have 2 dogs and several cats.  Compared to the FloorMate, the Crosswave is a bit quieter, a little lighter, very smooth and much, much easier to maneuver.  After reading many of the reviews of the Crosswave, I can tell many of these people have never used a FloorMate. The Crosswave is a great improvement over the FloorMate.  The FloorMate is louder and it required you to bend over a flip a dial to dispense the cleaning solution and then to suck up the dirty water, you needed to flip that dial back to suction. It was major nuisance especially if you forgot the flip the dial.  The FloorMate also would leave a small pool of water on the floor whenever you stopped using it.  The FloorMate could only handle minor dirt, anything like cat litter would just be pushed around. I would normally have my Neato BotVac vacuum before using the FloorMate.My only real complaint is that the Crosswave's dirty water tank is very small and fills up way to quick. But I can deal with it.Overall, it did a great job on my travertine, it easily vacuumed up any debris which a FloorMate couldn't do at all.In my opinion, its worth the additional money over the FloorMate.I have no opinion on it's use on area rugs,",61

AH80,4.0 out of 5 stars,this really does a great job at getting floors clean,the United States,11-Nov-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"As others have stated, this really does a great job at getting floors clean, and I mean 'bare foot' clean with no sticky residue. I only give 4 stars overall however for a couple of reasons...Firstly, I really do not enjoy the clean up afterwards. It's taken me a while to perfect how I tackle that job (down to about 10-15 minutes now) and the system does require space to leave parts to dry out for 24 hours. If you have a dedicated space that's okay I suppose, but I don't! Secondly....I really hate the positioning of the power cord as it exits the cleaner. It's set way too low to the ground, meaning that it constantly gets under foot or is in the way of my cleaning path. I reckon I tread on it at least  four to five times in one cleaning session, so as I push the cleaner away it comes to an abrupt halt as I've jammed the cord. I worry about damage I might cause. Poor design decision in my opinion, and I'm surprised no one has really mentioned this?? In summary, I would buy this again, but for the squeamish, the clean up is pretty nasty, and the cord is v annoying!",53

This vacuum/mop is a lifesaver for two reasons. First, I have many pets, and it's always difficult to vacuum and mop without some pet hair getting on the floor in between those two tasks. So, the fact that this vacuums and mops makes this ideal for pet people!  Second, I have degenerative disc disease, so my back can't handle vacuuming and mopping the house all at once...I can just do one or the other.

Martin A,2.0 out of 5 stars,Major disappointment - who wrote the glowing reviews??,the United States,21-Nov-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"After using this machine three times, I'm concluding that the wildly positive review that caused me to purchase it were fake reviews created by the manufacturer to deceive the public.  I gave this machine 2 stars [instead of zero] because it does a pretty good job on carpets.  But most vacuums do a pretty good job on carpets.  I could have spent $70 or $80 for a decent carpet vacuum.  This vacuum is sold as a whiz at tile and wood floors, which is mostly what I have in my house.  As to cleaning tile floors, I would give it maybe half a star.  I'd give it about a C- for just the issue of getting dirt and grime off tile floors.  It does a fair job, but not as good as I hoped or expected.  Hand-scrubbing is still required to really clean the floor.  But what is much worse it that it seems impossible not to leave dark streaks on the tile, which consist of dirty liquid cleaning solution that is generated by the machine but not absorbed by the brush.  No matter how many times I go over the same patch of tile, I can't get the brown streaks up and I still have a cleaning job to do on my own after the floor has dried.  How I wish I had saved the carton so I could send this back to Amazon, but it's a $250.00 life lesson.",46

D. Sharpe,3.0 out of 5 stars,Be prepared to spend some time cleaning,the United States,9-Jun-18,CrossWave,,"First off, know that I don't take issue with the machine itself. I give that part a solid 4 stars. But, the time consumed cleaning it knocks it down to a 3. Oh, and it's somewhat loud.Now, you don't HAVE to thoroughly clean it each time. If all you do is sweep/vacuum, you're good to go. But if you sweep AND mop, prepare to spend a bit of time cleaning it.The concept of the machine is a great one. Sweep and mop at the same time.Now the reality. What happens when you mix dirt and water? Flashback to childhood...MUD. If you just sweep/vacuum, move along, nothing to do but empty the tank. (And occasionally pull the hair from around the roller.)If you mop, get comfy and keep reading.Number one: Take out the dirty water tank. Remove the filter at the top. You can remove the screen or flip it up and clean. (I prefer to remove it so I don't accidentally break it). Just dump the tank out in trash if dry. If wet, wipe out the crud into the trash, then rinse out and set upside down to dry.Number 2: Take off the brush window.  Wipe out crud, rinse and set aside to dry.Number 3: Remove brush roller. Remove hair then rinse off the dirt and mud. You may need some dish detergent to clean all the mud. Once rinsed and wrung out it is recommended to set it in the sun to dry. Arizona sun makes quick work drying, but there is still a slight sour smell the next time you get it wet again.Number 4: Where you removed the dirty water tank is the round float stack. Dirt and hair gets sucked up through this on the way to the tank. Not all of it makes it all the way up. You can pull the float out and rinse off. But, there will still be a hairy, dirty clog in the hole. I use a 6"" long thin pipe cleaner brush to get up into the space and yank out all the dirt and hair stuck in there. (Eeewwww)Number 5: The bottom of the brush roller. A lot of mud gets stuck to the underneath side of the machine that, if not wiped off, smears mud across your just cleaned floor. Damp paper towel works great.Once everything is dry, reassemble.Other than the above steps, you're good to go. 😆I wasn't going to write this review, but after having to do this EVERY TIME I mop, I wanted to let others know my experience.",14

Autumn Sage,5.0 out of 5 stars,incredible! I will be using this weekly!,the United States,22-Jul-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Bissell has always been my favorite brand when it comes to my floors. About 25 years ago when they released the first Little Green Clean machine, I drove two hours to find one. I used it all the time.When I moved into my newer house a few years back, I bought a Bissell vacuum. To this day it still is my favorite vacuum. When I saw this I was wondering if I really needed it. I have vacuums to clean the floor and separate units to wash the floors. But having one that does both, that seemed like a good idea. When I opened it, I had to attach the handle and read the manual. It is really easy to use. It comes with a small trial bottle of cleanser. I am going to need to order more. It has a really long cord. I did not roll it up thinking I would need the cord but it was actually too long. What a nice thing to complain about. It is not that heavy, it is very easy to maneuver, and just glides over the floors. I was scared it would not be gentle on the floors but it is really smooth. It you have transition pieces from one floor to the other; it glides right over it without any problems. When you turn it on, it vacuums. I cleaned my floors last night and thought they were clean. I then vacuumed them with this unit. There is also a button at the top to spray the cleanser. I did so in areas I thought was clean. If you check the picture I will be uploading, you will see it picked up more dirt. I love how easy it glides and the swivel head is incredible! I have arthritis and this is easy to use for me.It also comes with a floor piece to put on when done or in between uses. I am really impressed with how easy this is to use. After it cleaned the floors with the cleanser, it did not leave any residue and dried quickly.I have always been a huge Bissell fan but this is up there for a product that I will be using weekly. It vacuums and mops! I am very impressed!",88

JJames,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use Crosswave All-In-One on my LIFEPROOF flooring!,the United States,11-May-21,CrossWave,,"Brutally honest review... 1st let me start by saying I don't have an Amazon card so I bought mine through Bissell and used their payment plan. Yes the Crosswave is a little pricey for some, BUT STILL BETTER THAN SCRUBBING ON MY HANDS AND KNEES!I use this machine on my LIFEPROOF laminate flooring for 2 reasons... 1, even on RUG setting it only puts out enough water to clean the floor not flood it, and 2, you just use hot tap water, there is no steam setting on the Crosswave so it doesn't warp my floor!I have 5 special needs rescue dogs and 5 cats (all roughly 10 pounds each). My pets have accidents in the house. My dogs are jerks and don't like to go potty in the rain so they have piddle pads. Sometimes they miss. My Crosswave handles it all!We are in mud season right now with all this rain. I use my machine almost every day (sometimes I just use my Swiffer mop). Yes sometimes the Crosswave smears the mud, THEY PROVIDE A TRAY TO CLEAN THE BRUSHES WHILE STILL ON THE MACHINE! All you have to do is add water to the tray, put the Crosswave on the tray, tip the handle back to engage the brush and turn it on! It cleans itself! So much quicker and easier than scrubbing on my hands and knees, even when having to pause to clean the brush!Yes sometimes it leaves wheel marks/streaks when I'm scrubbing my floors. This usually happens when I run ACROSS the boards instead of WITH the boards, I just go over it again the same direction of the boards! AGAIN, still quicker and easier than scrubbing on my hands and knees!Yes sometimes it leaves a wet hair mess where my door thresholds are, but so did my Swiffer wet mop, I just wipe it up with a wet paper towel when I'm done scrubbing floors. (Starting to sense a pattern here...) still quicker and easier than scrubbing on my hands and knees!I have LIFEPROOF LAMINATE FLOORING so after I scrub my floors using cleaner/water solution, I let my floor dry and scrub it again using just plain hot water to get the soap residue off the floor. This is still quicker and easier than scrubbing on my hands and knees!Clean up is easy! I run the brush on the cleaner tray. I use my sink sprayer to clean out the dirty water reservoir, hose out the filter and screen, hose of the brush and squeeze it out (just for good measure), hose off the front cover of the roller brush, then put the whole Crosswave down in my sink and hose off the part where the roller goes to get the extra pet hair off, and I'm done! Usually takes all of 5 minutes!If your still reading, thank you. If your curious about the piddle pad misses read on, if not, have a great day! (BUY A CROSSWAVE IF YOU DON'T WANNA SCRUB ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES!) 😆Ok, about the doggies, I use OdoBan Disinfectant with my water. I use about 1/4 of what the bottle shows for solution or it will bubble all over the floor. My pups occasionally ride in the semi with my husband and he feeds them people food. Even when they get yuck belly and have accidents in the house my Crosswave can handle it. I clean up with paper towel then disinfect with Crosswave and OdoBan, then I use spray bottle of OdoBan to clean my roller brush and rinse the soap out good before I put it in the drying rack. I clean my brush same way after cleaning up piddle messes. Easy peasy!",4
melissa,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good cleaner, but leaves a DIRT stripe bordering the room",the United States,18-Nov-17,CrossWave,,"I wanted a robotic mop but was very disappointed after trying the Braava Jet 240, which would be great for a clean house, not so great if there is any significant amount of dirt on the floors. I just bought the Crosswave last night and cleaned about 350 sq ft in about 1-1.5 hrs. I did multiple passes back and forth over the entire floor. This cleans very well. I was concerned that it wouldn't ""scrub"" enough since the brush rolls are mostly soft with just a few scrubbing bristles but it made my dirty floors cleaner than they have been since I moved in, 20 years ago. The solution has a scent but it isn't offensive. After the floors have dried, it lingers a bit, but very faintly. Pros: it vacuums while mopping, which I hadn't really thought through, but does save time and the annoyance of switching back and forth the way I did with a conventional mop if I saw dirt while in the middle of mopping. It cleans VERY thoroughly. It is easy to assemble and disassemble to refill the water tank or empty the dirty tank. Cons: It does not clean the inch up against the wall - this is a big con because you are left with a dirt stripe all around your house - which shows you how well it cleans but reminds you how dirty it was and still is at the wall. See Photos. You have to refill the water tank and empty the dirty water tank in the middle of mopping because they empty / fill up pretty quickly if you are using the solution trigger the whole time, as I did. This is easily done, so it's not a big deal, just a note. You do have to clean parts of the unit afterwards but it isn't hard - I did as another reviewer suggested and used my outdoor hose so as not to clog any sinks with fur. I did not have any issues with it leaving behind too much water. It dried within a half hour. I did not try this on carpet. I have semi-finished (slight finish coating in most areas) wood floors, and sheet linoleum. I also have three dogs and two humans with long hair. I did do some vacuuming with my Rhoomba 24 hrs before mopping. Another note, it is quite noisy.",12
Bridget D.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Some good things; some bad things,the United States,3-Jan-19,CrossWave,,"Full disclosure:  I bought my Bissel CrossWave at a Target; however, if you’re like me, I look up reviews on Amazon for just about anything I buy nowadays, regardless of where I buy it.First, I have a rambunctious Siberian Husky and have owned just about every kind of vacuum, floor/carpet cleaner and mop available. He really puts my floors and carpets to the test.I’ve had my CrossWave for over a year now and have only used it a handful of times. I wasn’t super impressed the first couple of times I used it, but we’ve had a lot of rain lately and Jax has been tracking in a lot of mud, so I figured I’d give it another go.  This time, I was glad I bought it.Pros:- It’s very light weight and easy to move around.- It uses surprisingly little water and floor cleaner, which is good because I don’t want to flood my wood floors with a ton of water.- It will definitely make your floors LOOK cleaner (though it’s questionable if they are).- It disassembles relatively easy and most of its parts are rinse and dry.- The unit shuts off when the dirty water receptacle needs to be emptied.- I’ve had two back surgeries and this makes mopping a lot easier for me. Traditional mopping is tougher for me to endure these days.Cons:- It may just be me, but I have a hard time getting the bottle where you put the water and cleaning fluid to come out.- Plan on this taking about two to three times longer than it does for you to vacuum the same area, if not longer, but it may be worth it to kill two birds with one stone.- It looks great when it’s wet, but there’s a dull look after it dries (though the pictures don’t seem to portray that; it looks pretty good in the “After” photos).- The vacuum portion dumps its findings in the same bin as the dirty water, which becomes a hairy mess I don’t want to dump in the toilet (remember, I have a Husky). I would prefer a separate bin for the dry debris that I could dump separately into the trash.- Though the floor LOOKS cleaner, a white towel test of an area I just went over, still comes up as pretty dirty (see pic). This is likely due to the sponge roll becoming really dirty early on and then just spreading it around. If you’re a clean-freak, this unit will NOT replace your current mop and some elbow grease.- The cleaning of the unit afterwards is tedious and then I have all the parts laying on my countertop for a day or two to dry. If I had a separate sink/countertop in my laundry room, I wouldn’t mind as much.- I’ve only tried to use it once for carpet cleaning, which there’s a setting for, after Jax unexpectedly vomited on the carpet. It did okay, but I still ended up using my separate carpet steam cleaner, as I wasn’t impressed with it on the carpet. I just don’t trust the water output and suction on this to believe it is really getting the carpet clean, but that’s just my opinion. Maybe on a thinner carpet it would do better.",7
M. Julia Morris,5.0 out of 5 stars,WORTH IT!,the United States,18-Sep-21,CrossWave,,"Honestly this machine has been a game changer for me. i have airbnb type rentals and after purchasing my first unit 5 years ago for my own home i have since bought them for each of the rental houses.The secret is you MUST thoroughly clean the unit after every use. At first this seems like a big pain but the time saved by not having to vacuum first and then slog buckets of water to mop the same areas the 5 minutes to clean the machine seems like an easy trade-off.Definitely get the corded unit that way you can do the whole house without needing to recharge, the cord is 25' long and so there is not a lot of plugging and unplugging. my floors are tile, laminate, hardwood and flat weave area rugs and one oriental carpet. the machine is so easy to uses that i find i do the floors much more often. generally every other day in the high traffic areas: kitchen, entry and hallways and major traffic area. And then the normal weekly cleaning in the bedrooms and baths.I have several dogs and this is a whiz with pethairs...no more tumbleweeds for me! It is important to use scissors or a razor to periodically (3 months or so) cut  off long hair, threads etc that can wind around the roller bar and especially get twisted around the ends of it where it inserts (quite easily I might add) into the spindle sockets otherwise it will make the roller not turn easily, stress the motor and eventually break the machine.I use the recommended Bissell cleaning fluid because it has a very pleasant -NOT ICKY FLORAL - neutral (almost like earl grey tea)scent and seems to leave no residue or streaking.Comments about the edges of rooms is valid. like any vacuum there is a small gap between where the machine can clean and the wall.  So I use a swiffer wet mop to run around the edges before i start. It also does not lie down super flat to get underneath beds and such..it will only extend under things about 1'. so the swiffer is the solution for these places too. I love the fact that with hot water in the canister the rooms are dry within a couple of minutes and the rooms is clean and usable again. it is very light and maneuverable and yet the suction is surprisingly powerful - as good as most regular vacuums - which is evident by the amount, size and weight of the debris you dump out of the waste container.I love the fact that, unlike a regular sponge or string mop you never just push around increasingly dirty water.These machines do not last forever. This isn't an electrolux that you will have for 20 years. about 4 years is what you can expect. And I have has a couple of lemons in the bunch that failed quite quickly but they were promptly replaced by Bissell. Nevertheless i fully intend to keep replacing them for as long as bissell keeps making them.I live in florida and go around barefoot a lot. the feeling under your feet when you do the floors is so wonderful. not sticky just squeaky clean. i am a college educated professional woman and I cant believe i could EVER get so enthused by a floor cleaning machine. Not to mention taking the time to rhapsodize in an amazon review.If you have a lot of deep pile wall-to-wall this may not be for you. but if you have children esp toddlers or pets and mostly hard floors you will find this necessary chore soooooo muuuuch easier. i recommend getting a spare brush and filter and swapping between uses, Also spraying the filter after hosing it at the sink with chlorox clean-up or similar before setting it aside to dry. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to thoroughly clean the unit after EVERY use otherwise the dirty water canister will smell like an outhouse (not kidding!).The only thing that could improve this machine would be to have the option of an extensible wand for corners, cobwebs up high, crumbs down the seatcushions and stuff like that but I understand that that would add to the weight and complexity (and cost) of the machine. So all in all I am 94% completely satisfied.",2

Dirk Van Essendelft,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Honest Review From a PhD Engineer Regarding Bearing Corrosion and Performance,the United States,23-Mar-19,CrossWave,,"I decided to buy this product because it could help us keep our house super clean when we have multiple messes a day with two little kids.After reading the most popular critical review and having a Hoover Spinscrub 50 that actually did have a fatal design flaw regarding wet bearings, I decided to take my vacuum apart and see if it has issues for myself and if/how they can be avoided.My answer is it might, but it should be easily avoided with a few simple maintainance tips. The vacuum motor is indeed sealed together as a single unit so if a bearing goes bad, there really isn't anything you can do but replace the motor which isn't hard.  Secondly, there is a set of seals that isolates the lower housing and turbo fan from the rest of the unit which is good.  Since the impeller unit seemed to be sealed and not able to be inspected without destroying the motor, I couldn't look for proper seals.  Given the speeds that the fan spins at, it is likely that there is no seal and there actually probably shouldn't be one as it would trap liquids and not let it dry if there e were a catastrophic liquid intrusion.Knowing that though doesn't make it a ""FATAL"" flaw because there are simple practices that will prevent damage.1) Keep the float in the tank free of debris.  That is your first and most important defence.2) Inspect the pleated filter for moisture after every use. If it was wet, just run the vacuum without anything attached for a couple minutes so it dries itself off.  That impeller spins itself so fast that it will dry out really quickly.3) look for moisture on those line of holes to the outside of where the filter seals against the plastic motor inlet.  Those are actually drain holes on the outlet side of the turbo fan.  If water got into your fan unit it will come out there.  Again the treatment is simple, run the vacuum for a few minutes not connected.4) MOST IMPORTANTLY.  Never never never never put the lower water bin back in the vacuum when any of the parts are wet.  In fact, it's probably best not to store it with the lower bin in the unit just in case.  That is probably the biggest cause of carosion.  In fact, this is probably why the manual says to wait 24hrs after washing before putting it back together.  If moisture is present in that lower bin, it will migrate to any and every part connected to it including the lower bearing in the fan and just sit there enabling corrosionPerformance wise, this thing is great.  It gets our floors clean so fast and does a fantastic job.  My only criticism is that it isn't a great dry vacuum.  I tried using it dry and it did pick up the dirt well, but everything ended up packed against the filter body and not in the canister.  For dry messes, use a broom on hard floors.",6

We’ve owned this machine for over 6 months and have no issues at all. It gets used 1-2 times a week. We have a larger home with LVP, tile, and a lot of area rugs...this machine cleans them all flawlessly! We have 3 cats so hair, puke, and litter pellets are aplenty. Even when I think the floors LOOK clean, the water this machine extracts up is FILTHY! Love it!! Almost want to buy a second one to keep in the box for a backup if this one ever dies...I hope they never discontinue these! (PS, I perform all recommended cleaning/upkeep on the machine after each use. It’s important to do!)",5
Cali Royalton,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great concept but…,the United States,11-Oct-21,CrossWave,,"Great concept but just like with most things, it’s great in theory but when it comes to execution, it just doesn’t hold water. (I mean it does, but, well… you get it.) anyways, first things first, the Pros:1. The idea is a great one. I’m definitely a sucker for  multipurpose products. The convenience and space they save is definitely appealing. So needless to say when I saw this, I had to try it.2. The roll comes out for easy cleaning. My shark, I literally took apart…with tools!! And still wasnt able to extract the roll to properly clean in. The suction stopped after awhile. Hence why I was in the market for a new one when I saw the crosswave.3. It is pretty easy to operate and comes mostly preassembled. That was appreciated! Lol4. The suction was ok. It wasn’t bad, it picked up pretty well for being a wet/dry vac.Ok. Now for the “fun” part. 😞 the cons. Now, let me start off by saying, I really, like REALLY wanted to like this vacuum. I really wanted this to work out. It would have been a game-changer! So let’s dive in the reasons why I took it back:1. Right off the bat, there’s no hose. I knew this before I bought it but that right there is pretty disappointing. But I thought, “well, it MUST get in crevices pretty well if it doesn’t have a hose attachment, riiiight?” Negative, Sarg. 😞 it did NOT get close enough to base boards to get those pesky crumbs. This is supposed to be geared towards pet owners and that’s exactly where the fur balls collect is at the edge of base boards. So that right there was a no-go for me. But let’s add on, shall we?2. The dirt reservoir, if not thoroughly cleaned EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Right away, it will end up smelling like someone took a dump right in your vacuum and left it there to mold for 6 months. Like it’s BAD!! I almost threw up, which woulda been bad since I wouldn’t have had a way to clean it up because the dry/wet vac needed to be emptied lol so lesson learned. Don’t leave it in there dirty more that a few hours. 🤦🏻‍♀️ But that means not only when I use it but when my family uses it too and they are notorious for NOT emptying the vacuum after using it. Tbh. I feel like it’s quite a task to clean it EVERY time. Like REALLY clean it. If it’s a matter of JUST emptying it, that wouldn’t be a huge deal, but it’s like, empty, clean filter, wash it out to rid the smell, take the roll out, rinse THAT, get hair etc off the roll, let it dry, clean inside the vacuum where the roll goes and the dirts sucks in. Whew, it’s a lot! And I vacuum everyday!!3. The cord gets in the way a lot. Pretty common with vacuums with cords, but it wouldnt stay hooked to the place it goes so I kept rolling over it. It’s petty, I know, but it really bugged me because I’m not used to it. Lol4. I saw other complaints of corrosion over time. I didn’t have it long enough to get to that point, but it’s definitely something to consider.5. The price. Now, it wouldn’t be that bad if it didn’t have the cons, but if I had to have a regular vacuum on top of this one, it defeats the purpose and is definitely not worth it. Lol6. It didn’t get messes very well. I had to go over and over some dirt spots on my kitchen floor several times.So overall, I love the idea, but there’s some definite flaws they need to work out.1. I’d love it if they added a hose. Even just a small one for base boards.2. Steam. If it put out hot steam, I feel it would clean much better and wouldn’t have to go over a single spot multiple times.3. I saw they now have a cordless so that’s cool but I would love to see a self-cleaning feature on the docking station that flushed the vacuum so I didn’t have to do it every time and dump the dirty water in a reservoir. Idk how it’d work, but that’s what they pay engineers for lol 😂4. Use better parts so it doesn’t corrode. Look into that, bissell! lolAnyways, hope that helps someone. That’s all folks!",One
Thomas Condon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum for 5 min.; clean vacuum for HOURS,the United States,24-Nov-20,CrossWave,,"The vacuum is the worse case of industrial design I have ever seen in a vacuum cleaning device.You vacuum for 5-10 minutes then spend the next half-hour cleaning the device itself after breaking it down. Then you have to let it air set so the future vacuumed dust and hair don’t further clog the poorly designed air channels that all have right angles, rather than smooth curves to move the debris through.So: Vacuum; empty (cough, choke!) dominate the sink space and use brushes and forced water to clean the guts; and THEN let it dry for minimum of 1-2 hours (1 in Dey sunny weather; 2-3 in damp conditions) before you can use it again.",3
BT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Trust me,the United States,9-Mar-19,CrossWave,,"After returning a shark rocket because I couldn’t bear the weight on my arm, I liked the idea of the cross wave. Let me tell you, it’s fabulous. 1) you CAN vacuum normally without the pad/brush on the bottom. Works pretty well to pick up my long hair, because there is no beater bar for it to get stuck in. So if you think you have to fill it with water and use the pad to vacuum, wrong. Works just fine. Why would you just vacuum, and leave the pad on the bottom to get dirty? I don’t understand people. Not a dyson; but pretty decent suction power.2) easy to clean. Even easier if you vacuum first. Then use the mop setting. Why? Ever try to mop a dirty floor? You’re still doing it, just with suction. I hate the reviews that show streaks. Don’t spray water on dirt. You get dirty water. Duh. Works fine doing a section at a time. Vacuum, mop the spots, next three feet.......I used to sweat bullets vacuuming and mopping my floor, now I look forward to it.3) rug setting works nicely. Expels more water than bare floors. I also use this setting for dog drool that’s like Elmer’s glue near my kitchen. I don’t care for the complaint reviews that it doesn’t get some stuff “stuck on” the floor. Well how did you get it off before? If a regular mop can do it, this can do it, on my floors anyway.4) the photos of the dirty water. No, your floor isn’t THAT dirty. Take a regular vacuum and dump it’s contents into a cup of water. It’s the same effect.I hope it holds up. I have a 155lb dog and a man-child who make a mess daily, this is my “go-to” for everyday cleaning. I got the green one. No idea if the purple one for pets is better. I did not get a discount, I was not asked to write a review.",4
elise mckenzie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Eh,the United States,16-Jun-21,CrossWave,,"I’ve had the crosswave for a few months and feel like I’m able to accurately review it now. After seeing people on Facebook & insta review it picking up whole meals I had to have it. When in reality they had to of been paid and worked some magic because mine absolutely does not do that. If you’re looking for a replacement for your mop and broom look elsewhere. Maybe a replacement for a steam mop or swifter. The rug feature? Absolutely pointless, leaves it dirtier than before. With all that being said I do use it about every other day. It does clean up well and make my floors look nice but I also sweep regardless if I use it and mop weekly still. When you do use it you have to get all the corners with a broom before you do because it’s terrible in tight places. Don’t even try to pick up food with it unless it’s maybe like a cheerio or 2. Tried noodles the first day I got it, smeared and streaked all over the floor big pieces broke up everywhere and wouldn’t suck it up. There’s also the absolute complete hassle of taking the whole machine apart every single time you use it. If you don’t you risk breaking it at the very least it will be absolutely disgusting and won’t work well. Is it worth the price no not at all, I got it as a gift though.",One
KCAT,3.0 out of 5 stars,Love this machine for my low pile rugs only....detailed review.,the United States,19-Apr-19,CrossWave,,"I have owned my BISSELL CrossWave Floor and Carpet Cleaner with Wet-Dry Vacuum, 1785A for almost a year now.  It comes with multiple cleaning solutions and rollers and because I bought it directly from Bissell over the telephone, I was sold a lot of add on products (larger containers of solutions, more filters, and more rollers for different surfaces).  This set me back about $500 which I had to pay in 6 installments to my credit card.  I have high traffic rugs and 5 cats.  I will say that because I use this machine, that my rug is immaculate.  I long ago stopped using it on my wood floors because even using the wood floor roller with the wood floor cleaner streaks were made and it was frustrating.  I use my swifter  wet as I have for many years.  I also no longer use it on my kitchen or bathroom hard floors because it does not seem to have the suction required to draw the water up from the floor and it remains wet for a while (just like traditional mopping).  Bissell claims that it vacuums and washes at the same time.  Does it do that? Sure it does; however, it is really, really, really disgusting to clean after use.  It takes about 30 to 45 minutes of post cleaning to make sure that mildew and residual hair and dirt does not build up in the machine.  If you fail to detail clean this machine, it will smell.  All parts much be 100 percent dry upon reassembly.  I use a hair dryer to accomplish this task.  The ""washing tray' this machine comes with does not perform the deep cleaning necessary.  I just use my tray for roller and machine storage.  So how do I make my life easier?  I first use my battery operated carper broom to remove every day cat litter and shoe traffic, then i use the BISSELL CrossWave Floor and Carpet Cleaner on dry mode to thoroughly deep clean the run (using the rug roller)  You would not believe what this machine picks up.  This is why I have not returned it.  Then I empty the dry dirt and debris into the garbage and return to my carpet to use the wet function.  Yes, the rug comes out bright like brand new, but the water is never fully extracted from the rug and I have to put my fan on for a half hour to make sure it fully dry.  That is when I retreat to my kitchen sink to clean all the parts of this machine.  I use it about once a week.  Again, I emphasize all parts must be completely dry before assembly.  You also must make sure that all the debris is removed in and around the sides where the roller sits.  One  last place you absolutely must clean is the base where the waste container meets the bottom,  The rubber hole holds onto a lot of dirt that should go into the waste container but is does not.  I hope this has helped someone trying to decide if this machine is really for them.",3
Jenn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Requires a lot of maintenance to use correctly.,the United States,24-Apr-21,CrossWave,,"I had purchased this to replace my prior Bissel Steam mop. My routine was usually to sweep than steam mop. But I thought I’d give this a try, and do both at once. After testing 4 products, this one was the worst and least efficient. I also tested the Bissel Steam mop and vacuum ( the winner) and the Shark Steam mop and a robot vacuum. This product left behind TONS of wet pet hair and debris. It also left dotted streaks all over the hardwood floors. Because it’s a floor cleaner, it works like a carpet cleaner, with a clean water tank and dirty water tank that needs to be emptied and cleaned after each use. I knew that when purchasing but still underestimated how much work that would be in reality. So even after all that work setting it up, adding cleaning solution, cleaning out the clean and dirty water tanks I was still left with clumps of wet pet hair and streaks all over my floors. Then I had to clean and dry the fabric roller  it was so much work! Definitely not worth the work involved and definitely not something I’d want to do every week.",One
D.

This was my favorite item in my Miami apartment… because it did such an amazing job cleaning my Jerusalem Stone floors.  It was not the best on ceramic or shiny floors. Best suited stone and wood flooring.  I purchased new and used it once a day for every day.. until it died after 6 months.  As you can see in the photo, clean it to see where the issue is to fix on my own. So I start researching it on here and find out that there is in fact a defective issues with this and it will die for everyone at some point.  So I text my best friend and his friend who recommended it and they both said, their unit died a month ago.  I was going to send it to be fixed or replaced… but based on how they make products.  I’m not sure if I want to be a customer of their products anymore.",2
pianogirl9,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs greater flexibility and faster post-use cleanup,the United States,8-Jan-21,CrossWave,,"I used my Crosswave for the first time and loved how easy it was to both sweep and mop at the same time! Saved me so much time not having to do both steps separately for around 1500 square feet of floor space. The flexibility of the handle is sorely lacking. When mopping under the kitchen table or under end tables for a deeper ""whole house"" cleaning, the head lifts off the floor because the handle doesn't have much range of motion. Also, because of that, I wasn't able to get the mop into tighter spaces such as between the toilet and sink vanity. The cleaning solution doesn't get all the way to the outside edges of the head as the roller doesn't go all the way to the outside edge, so when mopping along a wall, there will be about an inch stripe along the wall that doesn't get cleaning solution on it. The cleanup of the machine itself is a bit time-consuming if you want it to be thoroughly clean. These things are a little frustrating, but the overall benefits outweigh these minor inconveniences. It cleaned the floors (laminate and vinyl plank) quite well, and my husband even commented that the floor looked good and felt better under foot. I do think it's a bit overpriced for what it does and how much maintenance is required after each use.",One
MAKER OF THINGS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend!  Especially for dog owners!,the United States,3-Aug-21,CrossWave,,"I have a Bissell carpet cleaner and this floor cleaner.  Both are great.This vacuums and cleans.Easy to fill water/solution reservoir with water & solution lines.  Very easy to empty dirty water container.I purchased a second water/solution reservoir for about $25.  I fill both reservoirs at the same time to get twice the coverage per filling.  Still needs dirty water container emptied twice, but is easy to do.I like the smell of the floral cleaning solution better than the pet cleaning solution.  I use the floral solution, even though I have dogs.It is worth the money because I save on paper towels (about 6 half sheets) and bottled floor cleaner when my dogs have an accident.I paid $199 on sale, but would still buy it realistically up to $400.I end up cleaning the floor 4+ times each week, because it is so easy. I never liked using a mop and bucket, or the floor pads on a stick.I would wash your floor with your old way, then use this.  Your collected water will probably still be dirty.My dogs and I have short hair.  I have not seen my wife's long hair around the roller, so I think hair seems to be ok.I have recommended this Bissell product to many of my family and friends.",One
Sara Thurman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for Day to Day,the United States,11-Jun-20,CrossWave,,"Okay, so I've had this for about 2 weeks now and I've given it a good go. Just to give everyone an idea of the kinds of messes I clean up I have a toddler and an inside dog.Okay for the pros, my son and I both had an allergic reaction to the cleaning solution that came with it (and I didn't care for the solution) so we have been using just hot water or really diluted Dr Bronners for especially messy floors. Since doing this, this thing is awesome for day to day clean up. We have engineered Harwood floors and I find as long as I don't go against the way the floor is laid it doesn't leave streaks and since I'm not using a cleaning solution I'm not getting a waxy build up on my floors. It functions pretty okay as a vacuum, but I have a Dyson stick vacuum and you just can't beat the turning capabilities of a Dyson so I'm slightly biased on that point. My #1 selling point was using it to spot clean our white rug. After a few passes it got a raspberry stain out that had been there for months with JUST WATER! Definitely keeping and would purchase again based on that alone. You do have to disassemble it any time you're mopping, but I don't find it to be too cumbersome. Takes 3 minutes to take it apart and rinse everything out. This thing stays in my utility room and gets pulled out several times a day to spot mop.Okay, now for the cons. As I mentioned earlier it doesn't turn all that great, but whatever. Then other major thing for me is, as a mom I do the most of my cleaning early in the morning or late at night when my kid is sleeping. It's just way too loud for that, probably even louder than a traditional vacuum. Lastly, this will NOT replace deep cleaning and getting up against base boards, etc. Every now and then I will have to pull out my actual mop and deep clean to get in all the corners and random spots the Crosswave just doesn't clean well. But hey, I've had it for two weeks and haven't had to do that yet. My bet is I'll only have to actually mop about once a month which is pretty sweet!",One
JeanneP357,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love my crosswave but I think the advertising is a bit misleading?,the United States,14-Dec-19,CrossWave,,"I love my Crosswave.  I do think advertising it as a machine you can vacuum and mop with at the same time is a bit of a stretch.  You don't have to be a chemist to understand that if you add any quantity dirt, hair, and miscellaneous debris to a bit of water you are going to make some sort of hairy muddy substance that will be difficult to suck up.  Plus if you have all that on your floor from the start it's going to take a long time to get your floors clean.  However, if you start with a reasonably clean floor BEFORE you add water and solution to your floor cleaner and run your floor cleaner until the water in your return tank is reasonable clear you will have really clean floors.  I had to clean my floors several times before my water was not an very opaque gray. If you have streaks it's because your floors are still dirty.  MOPS, and Vacuums at the same time...hummm .  I also have a Hoover.  It does pretty much the same thing as the Crosswave.  I even have a steamer with sweet little pads..no magic there either.  You have to vacuum first!!

Gattina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I'd Known About It Sooner,the United States,9-Apr-20,CrossWave,,"I have travertine floors, and they always felt dirty,, except right after I had therm professionally cleaned. This machine changed that. My floors are clean enough after using it that I can walk around in white socks, and the socks don't get dirty. Today it really proved itself. The dirty water tank was full, and when I took it off the machine, I dropped it, emptying all that dirty water and pet hair all over my kitchen floor.. No problem. I put the tank back on,, sucked up all the nastiness,, then went over it with clean water. I was impressed. I'm surprised there are so many complaints about how hard it is to clean when you're finished. It's not.

pickymom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dogs and white tile can finally get along!,the United States,9-Apr-17,CrossWave,,"Answer to my prayers!  I have wanted something like this FOREVER because the only thing worse than mopping is doing it after you've had to vacuum. This does both...really well!  I have white tile, a LOT of it and 2 dogs, one of which is black and sheds a LOT. Seriously, I don't have dust bunnies I have dust rabbits (see photo). When I vacuum (regular vacuum) if it happens to go over a wet spot like near the water bowl, I end up with smeared hair everywhere that then just spreads around with the mop. I was VERY skeptical that this would do the same but it didn't at all. From dried slobber, to muddy paw prints to grass clippings and dirt, this Crossswave handles it all.  I was also concerned I would end up using a ton of cleaning solution but it dispenses it very sparingly.  That's good news and bad news.  It doesn't put out much liquid so I found I had to go over each area twice to get it good and wet. But my floor is sparkling and I know it's super clean because I wasn't just pushing around dirty water with a mop. It's super easy to set up, empty dirty water, and refill the clean solution bottle. I didn't love the Bissel solution so just ended up using my own with hit tap water.  As far as cleaning edges, the vacuum aspect takes care of this well, but whether you run it along sideways or front first, the brush does not get right up on it and leaves about 1 1/2 dry.  But since the vacuum sucks everything away from the edges I didn't see this as a problem. My only complaint is the cord it too short, but I have huge areas to cover so for smaller spaces it would be sufficient.Overall LOVE this product. Have only used it once but hopefully it will continue to perform well and last a while. Btw, I got mine cheaper elsewhere with a 20% off coupon.  You all know where...BB&B.",10
P. Carrera,2.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted this to work!,the United States,16-Jul-17,CrossWave,,"2 units and a month later...1st unit had problems turning off. Right out of the box if we wanted it to turn off, we had the unplug it from the wall. No big deal because the cord isn't that long. So when we went from room to room, we have to unplug it.2nd unit worked pretty well until today (2nd time I used this unit) when the whole bottom part, where the brush is & liquid is dispensed,  just sprang apart, twice, while I tried to use it.My friend told me about the CrossWave & made it sound like a miracle worker. At $225-$250, I did a lot of research & decided to try it because I really hate doing floors and anything that might help is worth it.My personal situation is 3 cats, 1 dog, 1 husband & 2 teenage daughters with VERY LONG hair. All common areas in my house have tiles.1. Absolutely no time was saved. It takes me just as long to sweep or vacuum & mop. Maybe even less if you count the clean up required of the CrossWave.2. To get it as clean, I have to treat each area three times. Once as a dry vac, then while holding down the liquid dispensing button a 2nd time, and then go over it a third time. The all in one, 1st time is a charm, is tv fiction.3. It doesn't vacuum big things, like lollipop wrappers. Plus with the vacuum, I can just use the attachment to quickly dust the baseboards, or go under the edge of the dryer or furniture. This it too bulky to do that.4. Doesn't reach edges & it's too wide to go between the wall & toilet, so I still have to use the mop to reach those areas.5. Cleaning it up afterwards. EWE!!!! You have to take it apart. You just can't pour it down the drain like it shows you on TV. It's filled with hairs, dust, sand, etc. (See picture) So after you pour out the liquid, you got to touch that icky mess. After you clean the multiple pieces, then you have to clean the base of the unit. And the brush.. remember I said my girls have long hair? Well I have to cut through the hair wrapped around the edges of the brush. Making clean up a big pain.Bottom line is, not worth the money. I got a blister the first time I used it. It does not save time. Nor does it clean as well. I still needed to use the vacuum & mop. And the clean up was gross and not worth the effort.Back to sweeping, vacuuming & mopping I go.",33
Brandon Golway,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good vacuum, Meh WetVac",the United States,7-Sep-20,CrossWave,,"I've had this for a few years, thinking it would be great for a smaller apartment (800 sq ft). While it does both functions fairly well, you can't really use them together with great results. If you decide to use the mop/wetvac feature on tile floors you'll most likely end up with dirty water in between the tiles since the suction power isn't amazing; if you use both functions when your floor is dirty/full of pet hair be prepared for pushing around globs of wet hair. Exactly what I want to do. The brush bar only spins when you have it on rug mode, so no scrubbing happens when you have it on hardwood mode, it just spits out water, which you move around and it hopefully sucks up. The best way I've found to use it is to vacuum first to get everything up, then go over the entire area again with the mop function, using rug mode regardless of the surface type. This way you cover all of your bases, and it definitely works because my water in the tank is always a dark opaque grey with a bunch of crap floating in it. Another downside is that it's a bit of a pain to clean since you have to clean the brush bar, the tank, the vacuum head and tunnel where it connects to the tank since that collects all sorts of nastiness, and then the filter....each time that you use it.",One
Meg,2.0 out of 5 stars,The search continues,the United States,28-Feb-20,CrossWave,,"I had such high hopes for this little mop/vac.  As a single mom with two messy kids and two dogs, I was looking for something to cut the time it takes to vacuum and mop, so that I could fit it more frequently into my busy schedule. Unfortunately, this machine just does not live up to my expectations. It vacuums well enough, but the mopping action is pretty lackluster. After my first use of the machine, I mopped a section of my hallway and laundry room and then when I was done, I went back over it with a clean bucket of water/cleaner and a microfiber cloth and the floors were still pretty dirty. I decided to keep it for a few months to give it a chance and see if it made mopping easier so that I would do it more often.  Well, it didn't and I'll explain why.This machine takes way too many passes going very slowly to mop and then suck back up the cleaning fluid, the clean water tank (which is virtually just a cheap pop top water bottle) doesn't hold nearly enough liquid to complete my small home. There is no heating element or steam, so even if I fill the clean water with as hot of water I can with the cheap plastic the bottle is made of  - the cleaning water is room temp long before I'm done. There's no way to adjust the friction or put more pressure to get crusty or dried messes up. The machine would also really benefit from a light to see the cleaning path, like my shark vacuum has.The cord doesn't seem nearly long enough, and is always in the way. I would try the cordless version if the machine had worked well otherwise, but I've owned a half dozen cordless vacs and they never have enough watts or maintain a charge long enough to complete the job - then you have the hassle of a degrading battery.There is no filter in this model to separate the solid materials or pet hair from the water, so when you're done you have to figure out what to do with the dirty water filled with crud. I have to use a kitchen strainer or flush the dirty water down my toilet. You could splurge for the pet version that comes with a filter, but at well over $250 - it should really come with it because even if you dont have pets you're going to have crud when you vacuum and mop together. Then when you're done, you have the cleanup of the machine and parts, and you also have to wash the roller. So after filling the tank, mopping, plugging and moving the cord to different outlets numerous times, replacing the water/cleaner at least once and then cleaning up the machine - I dont feel like it really saved me any time or effort. I think my floors got much cleaner with about the same effort and time as vacuuming then mopping. Not worth the cost of the machine, so unfortunately, it's getting returned and I will keep looking.",One
Romy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,20-Nov-20,CrossWave,,I have all tile and I love it. I've had the crosswave for about 4 months and it works great. I still use a regular mop once in a while for deep cleaning but this vacuum does a really good job and leaves the floors clean and ny house smelling nice. The only thing I had to get used to is rinsing the filters after every use but it doesn't take long at all. I would recommend replacing filters/brushes every 6 months or so dependent on how often you use it and how dirty they get. Rinsing with soap and water works well but after a while they do start looking and smelling funky. Not sure if I would recommend this for carpet as I've had no luck using this on the one area rug in my house but I also haven't looked much at the instructions to know if it's something I'm doing wrong. Overall this is a great vacuum and mop.,3
norwichlover,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than mopping,the United States,25-Nov-19,CrossWave,,"I have a pack of dogs and concrete floors.  This gets up much more of the dirt and smell than mopping over and over again.  It does take a LONG Time to get the floor done.  You have to pass back and forth a couple of times very slowly for it to pick up the water which is why, I think, some reviewers say it leaves streaks and water.  First time I got it I did the whole area twice and on the third time I finally got somewhat clean water.  I've had it a couple of months and use it once a week, takes about 1.5 hours to do my 1000 sf kitchen/family room.  It does not get up against the baseboard, it gets about inch and a half away.  I'm looking for maybe a commercial machine that puts more water on the floor and has superior suction.  It'll cost a lot more but this thing was not cheap and doesn't feel particularly sturdy.  for your information, the clean cup water holder holds about a quart and that sprayed on the floor is going to be spread pretty thin which is why I have to go over each area 2-3 times.  For my area I fill the tank about 3-4 times",3
CJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!! Time saver !!!!,the United States,24-Apr-21,CrossWave,,"I can’t emphasize enough how great this is... Definitely a time saver. As a mom of an infant and toddler, my time is limited. I can sweep AND mop my floor if I only have an extra 10 minutes to spare!!!! Yes, you have to clean some components. Yes, you have to air dry some components but you also have to do that with a mop.. cleaning is very fast, just rinse out the dirty container. It cleans messes and spills with ease and efficiency. Floor dries extremely fast. I accidentally bought carpet cleaner formula (instead of multi floor) and noticed a little extra water/cleaner is expelled but nothing major. Only con (not a deal breaker) is that a retractable cord would be great. Other than that, no complaints... Great, great product! A ++++",One
Chris McCray,3.0 out of 5 stars,A Very Expensive Mop,the United States,24-Dec-19,CrossWave,,"I bought the Crosswave for a great deal at a local wholesaler.  I used it for the advertised purposes and have a pretty solid understanding of its capabilities.First, let's call this device exactly what it is: an electric mop with a vac feature.  Anything other description would be dishonest.  It's basically a stick version of the Bissell Spotclean (which I have and use occasionally).  The Crosswave is engineered for and around mopping hard floors quickly without the need for a sweep beforehand.  For that purpose, it's fantastic!  It saves a lot of time if you have a large area of tile, linoleum, or hardwood.  The brush roller is microfiber with nylon bristles, which has been able to pick up even dried sticky fluids with some repeated passovers.  A vast majority of the water is vacuumed up with the debris, making the timeline for floors to dry very short.I tried rugs with it and unless the rug is large and heavy, the suction is too much - I guess they tried with the dedicated nylon brush roll in case you do have heavy rugs on your floors.  I don't; I only have a few small rugs that just get stuck in the vac when I attempt to clean them.  I tried just vacuuming the hard floors (and short carpet) and found the container cleanup to be just as tedious as when it has dirty mop water.  Ergo, the only reason I'm gonna be breaking this thing out is for a quick mop.  No streaks, pleasant smelling formula, good for that specific purpose.The reasons I have to dock it a couple of stars is for the following:- No hose/attachments to get in the corners, against trim, or between small obstacles - it is NOT a replacement for a regular vacuum cleaner- Still corded, which makes it just a touch cumbersome, and I think that Bissell should be a master of replaceable, recyclable, rechargeable battery devices by now (like, say, Ryobi in their own product line)- Holy moly is this thing expensive.  Maybe my expectations for a $200 machine (on sale) is too high, but I wanted this thing to replace my vacuum for carpet, too.  It does not, so this is one of the world's most expensive mops.  Yes, it saves time and is light and nifty, but honestly when I can buy a new steam mop and excellent HEPA vacuum separately, for much less, it does create a degree of buyer's remorse.",One
TallStar's Muse,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible for pet hair,the United States,10-May-21,CrossWave,,"Despite the less than glowing reviews, I got this because my friend has it and loves it. My friend only has one, short haired dog. I have three dogs and three cats, and that seems to make all the difference. I used this after vacuuming all floors and carpets with another vacuum, but the cross wave still got so full of hair. Hair is bad because it clogs the tube, but also because the waste container gets full of absolutely disgusting wet, super dirty, clumps of gross pet hair. I had to fish this out with my fingers and throw into the garbage can, then dump remaining gross water into toilet, then rinse the waste container in the shower. I also had to repeatedly stop the machine and clean out hair from the tube. I had to do that whole long and gross process four times for 1000 sq feet that I cleaned. The machine also leaves smears of dirt and hair along every edge. Another commenter stated that people who have dirty houses have this problem… Well, fair enough, with six pets I have a lot of dirt and I need cleaning help that this new cleaning machine cannot provide. This machine is probably best as some kind of “polishing” device for people who already have a clean home. On a more minor note, I really dislike the smell of their cleaning solution; it made my nose run the whole time I was using it.",One
Chris Roth,3.0 out of 5 stars,Solid 3,the United States,31-Jul-21,CrossWave,,"The thing cleans hard floors amazing. I don't know if I would really call it a rug cleaner... it slightly outperform a traditional vac, lightly mists, brushes, and does a decent job at removing surface stains.My big issue is the overall design. The thing makes very little sense. Everything pops apart and isn't held together very well. The lid on the dirty water is not secure at all. Once out of the machine it is 3 pieces that neat I to eachother. I frequently clean the entire house and spill the dirty water as I try and clean the machine. Added bonus the dirty water container is not flat on the bottom so is extremely prone to tipping.The other thing is prepare to get intimate with that mess. It feels great sucking up a nasty mess with this thing on hard floors. Then when you're done you get to pop all these nested prices and filters apart, and clean them by hand. So now your floor mess in in a sink... There are about 5-6 pieces that are covered in wet nasty dog hair and dirt. You get to clean these by hand every time. The machine itself has a 5"" intake tube at the bottom. This will also be caked in filth. Be ready to lift the entire unit onto your counter so you can wash this bad boy out.All that being said, it does clean floors...",
Cattle Pillar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Freakin Amazing!,the United States,17-Dec-18,CrossWave,,"My husband bought this machine to add to my cleaning arsenal to combat the fur and mess from 5 cats and 1 dog, and the everyday gross that comes with 2 kids. It's been awesome so far! I've only had it for a few weeks so I can't speak to the longevity of the cleaner, but Crosswave's performance has me over the moon happy.In my 2 story house (hard floors on the first floor, carpeting in most of the 2nd floor), I have 2 Roombas, 2 upright vaccuums, 1 canister vacuum, a Braava, 2 stick vacs, and assorted brooms, dustpans, and swiffer type mops. If you already own Roombas, you know that there are limitations to the level of clean you will get with them. The vacuums are great for day to day pick up and do help to keep the mess down, but you have to use manual vacuums for the superior suction power a couple times a week (I often find myself vacuuming with my uprights or canister vac WHILE the Roombas are running). Same with the Braava. It's a great little mopping robot to set to go in busy times and keep the floor looking reasonable, but it is not going to give you that deep clean that a machine like this will give you. In my household, this machine is for that deep cleaning after the roombas and braava have kept noticeable surface dirt at bay over the course of the week.The advertising is a little deceiving for the Crosswave, because you are not just going to pull it out for little messes. It's an ""event"" type cleaner, one that you take hours to run and move all the furniture around to get under it, etc. The reason why is that it needs a fair amount of cleaning itself once you are finished using it. I don't think anyone would want to use it for a little mess then dump the cup, rinse everything out, wash off the roller, set everything out to dry, etc. It truly does pick up so much dirt and funk though, it is an amazing cleaning tool. I love that it picks up fur like a champ and I don't have to sweep before I start or prep too much at all. The water is always a dark horrible color when I am done and the cup is filled to the brim with fur. It boggles my mind that my other cleaners miss so much dirt and grime over a week of cleaning. The best part is that I can move the litter boxes and go right over what my cats have kicked out of the box without much ado. It sucks everything up and leaves a clean floor behind. If you have a pet situation like I do, I highly recommend that you dump the waste cup in the toilet instead of trying to use the sink. All that fur, litter, and dirt the Crosswave collects is no joke!My floors absolutely sparkle after using this. I realized quickly that the difference in the floor shine comes from no surface fur left on the floor when I am done. The Roombas leave a haze of fur and dust when I am finished as it settles back onto the floor after being blown into the air, but not the Crosswave. The Braava cannot pick up all the dust and fur because it works with a disposable pad system that doesn't suck anything up, same with my other pad mops. With the Crosswave, the floor is so clean, it's actually thrilling!One of the biggest cons is that you won't be able to get in tight spaces so plan to do a bit of the cleaning of corners and around the toilet by hand. I don't mind this so much because I clean the baseboards and toilets frequently so I am wiping a lot down by hand anyway. The Crosswave takes care of the bigger areas (as well as my area rugs-it works like a charm on those too) and I attend to crevices and corners with microfiber cloths. It's still a time saver with great payoff. I can't use it on my carpeting upstairs so that stays Roomba and vacuum territory, but I use for all the bathrooms and any hard flooring/area rugs I can find.I have used the Bissel cleaning solution that came with the machine and once that was gone, I moved on to using Mrs. Meyers all purpose cleaner or white vinegar with no issues whatsoever. A tip for using other cleaners that might create more suds than the Bissel cleaner is to really reduce the amount you are using. I don't use the marks on the water container when I use Mrs. Meyers because it is very concentrated and will suds up too much if you add that amount. I wing it and add just a dollop to the cleaning tank, and it works great (and smells great!). If you are using vinegar, you can definitely use the mark guidelines on the water tank. I love the versatility of all the different cleaners you can use with this machine for different purposes. For me it is Mrs. Meyers for the main floors, and vinegar for the rugs and bathrooms. Works great!Just to clarify, I am not a germaphobe nor do I particularly enjoy all the cleaning I have to do because I am a sucker for furry friends. I realize that I sound like a lunatic with all my cleaning supplies, but it's really just out of necessity or my house would look like a trash heap in short order. This is my absolute favorite tool for cleaning that I have gotten in a long time! I'm kind of an expert about what works and what doesn't, and I think the Crosswave is a total boss all around. Highly recommended!",2
E. Oliveira,2.0 out of 5 stars,Left big streak marks on my floor!,the United States,15-Nov-17,CrossWave,,I REALLY had high expectations for this vacuum cleaner. I have a large apartment with waterproof vinyl flooring throughout and this vacuum left big streak marks on my floors - on both vinyl and porcelain tiles - see pictures. I used it 3 or 4 times and tried different cleaning solutions on it since their cleaning product did not work for me at all. At the end the big marks were still there and I ended up having to hand mop my floors with my good old towel to fix the problem.I would still keep the vacuum for the following reasons:- great suction - really cleans well- wash cleans carpets (something other regular vacuums would never do)- mopping and cleaning at the same time is a great time saving feature (that is if you don’t have to do anything else after the job is done)But I will return it because:- after all the work I still have to come and hand mop the entire house again to take the streak marks out.- this is a heavy vacuum which hurted my back- very pricey I paid $250 for itAt the end I am very disappointed it did not work on my floors. So try it first and decide for yourself!,5
Sage Kanosh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible! Just buy it!,the United States,7-Feb-21,CrossWave,,"This thing is amazing! I don’t know how I ever lived without it. I live in a small apartment with my husband, our baby, and our dog and two cats. I knew our floors would be dirty because our apartment was built in the 40s and still has its original hardwood floors, and they were filthy when we moved in. But I was shocked to see the kind of dirty conditions we’ve been living in!The suction power is amazing; it’s great for cleaning up hair and other debris. I think it makes a great dry vacuum. My floors have never been cleaner and I actually enjoy using it and look forward to it each time. Truth be told, it will leave streaks, but I’ve heard this is just if your floors are really dirty (like mine were) however it’s too early for me to confirm that since I’ve only used it twice. If you do another dry pass over the streaks they will go away. Unfortunately it won’t work on a shaggy area rug or high-pile carpet. And cleanup can take a little while if you’re like me and you use soap every time to clean up. I thoroughly clean all the parts and it takes about 10 minutes. If you just do a quick rinse it will only take a few minutes. However, I think it’s well worth the cleanup time!I think the crosswave is a must-have for anyone with hard floors. I’ve already recommended it to my whole family. If this one breaks I will buy a new one; that’s how much I love it. If anything changes, I’ll update my review*I did not buy this on Amazon, I was able to get a better deal on the bissell website*",
Brandon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product so far.,the United States,10-Sep-17,,,"I didn't purchase from here, but, I really enjoy it, It does a good job on floors and I used to use a mop that was the pad and spray nozzle, I was looking for something that wouldn't just push the dirty water around, this does great for that, as it sprays the rollers and the rollers scrub the floor, Before I would sweep and vacuum my floors and then mop, This does it all in one, the only gross thing is the hair it picks up is gross looking. most of it will make its way to the dirty water tank, however, some stays in the track on its way and you have to remove the brush (which is easy to do) and wipe the hair off. My wife and i are on the fence overall. Her feeling is, for the price, it should do a better job. But i can't fault it for not getting tape residue, or pasta that has been stepped on and dried onto the floor. We have a new baby and have ignored cleaning as much as we should, we bought this and the water was really dirty, which was gross but i went over the area a couple times and it came out almost clear after the third pass.I can't think of a better product for what it does, the other options, like the steaming version, uses a pad and steams, but for how dirty my floors get, it would be the same problem of pushing a dirty mop pad around.Don't plan it getting hard, caked on stuff first pass, but I really think it is great and worth the price for saving me extra steps and time and the fact that it sucks up the dirty water.One thing is that once you clean the filter, it has to dry for 24 hours. It doesn't get really dirty, I'd treat it like a vacuum filter, clean it every once in a while. the brush can be cleaned if you want and the reservoir can be rinsed each time you dump. When i rinsed the brush, mostly clean water came out of it, which was nice to see that it wasn't holding dirty water, the reservoir just rinses off and put it all back together, if you turn the vacuum back on and let the brush spin, it will remove extra water and then turn it off and store it to dry, ready to use for the next time.Hope this helps with your decision to get one.",4
Mother of Pearl 3,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE MY CROSSWAVE!,the United States,9-Sep-18,CrossWave,,"I love this machine! I use it almost everyday. Really makes cleaning up great and quick. I even use it to VACUUM my carpets and when I get to the tiled floors get back to the mop and vacuum setting. It truly makes full house cleaning seemless. I can pretty much get through my entire lower level - which has tile floors in my kitchen, breakfast nook, foyer and two bathrooms on 2 full containers of cleaning water. So I end up stopping to throw out the dirty water one time during cleaning. The clean up is quick too, I throw the dirty water down the garbage disposable side of the kitchen sink, wash the canister, filter and the multipurpose roller brush, wipe the inside of the vacuum head/ nozzle part with a Lysol wipe or two and set it all out to dry for the next time.  I use hot tap water and follow directions when adding my cleaner (pine sol) and so far so good. Smells so clean and nice afterwards and actually very little pine sol is used since I just go up to the indicator line on the canister.  I plan to order another multipurpose roller brush or two just to have on hand.  Great machine! Oh and my bathroom toilets happen to be located just right to get the vacuum head around both sides of my toilets in both bathrooms on the first floor so I only have to manually clean around the toilet in my upstairs bathroom while I mop/vacuum. The vacuum head does leave about a half inch or so of space when I run it along side (parallel?) the baseboard area of the floors but if I run the vacuum head straight (perpendicular?)to the baseboard it cleans right up to it. So for my house it’s worked fantastic. I wash my floor rugs so I don’t use this vacuum to clean them and I don’t have throw rugs so I can’t attest to that use of the vacuum. Overall I’m a very happy camper.  I was going back n forth between this and the Bissell symphony steam vacuum and I think I will still get that one because I’d like to steam clean the floors once a month or so.",2
zuziie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disposable 2 years Product,the United States,3-Mar-20,CrossWave,,"I bought a Bissell Crosswave at Costco and while it was working was very useful, the concept is great but parts are not, gears should be metal not plastic, specially for the price. It stopped working just a few months after warranty ended, what a coincidence looking at all the reviews this products are design to fail and trash the planet, wow! it looks like I was one of the few that the product lasted after warranty ended, can't belive it!!. I called customer support and they couldn't do anything for me even though they said they report the issue to their corporate they could only offer me a discount to buy another one...what??? Every two years I'm supposed to buy a new one to TRASH THE PLANET ?? I asked where could I get the internal parts to fix it and they offer them only through their service locations but they don't sell the parts to customers they install the parts and want to charge you as if you bought the product new. I wouldn't recommend Bissell, this are disposable products design to fail in a year, or two the most.

Kimberly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saves so much time!,the United States,10-May-21,CrossWave,,"I don’t hate cleaning, but sometimes I just don’t have the attention span to sweep and then mop all of my floors. I live in an old house, with three cats so dust and cat dander ends up everywhere so sweeping is a must. When I heard that this thing does both at the same time, I was skeptical and obsessively consumed reviews.It was SO weird not sweeping up cat hair, cat food, cat litter, the dirt from plants they push down. I didn’t sweep any before using this machine. So to watch it suck it all up and then continue to mop the floor and was strange and exciting at the same time.I was SO impressed with the performance! And the clean up was very easy. I see a lot of reviews that complain about having to clean the whole machine but most of it is just rinsing things. The worst part was taking the big hair ball out of the dirty water! But it didn’t take me more than a few minutes before it was nice and rinsed.

Foodiewife,5.0 out of 5 stars,Understand that this isn't a professional floor cleaner. It's beautiful for maintaining the cleanliness of your floors! Love it!,the United States,10-Sep-17,CrossWave,,"Here's the thing. Don't buy this, expecting it to remove grime that has been on your floor for a long time. Don't buy this, solely, as a vacuum cleaner. Otherwise, you'll hate this.  The first time I used this on my tile kitchen floor, I was disappointed. But, wait! Husband gave the floor a good scrub on his hands and knees (I have an artificial knee, hence that's why I bought this-- to make my life easier).  The next time I used this on the kitchen floor, everything was clean. Bottom line: This is the perfect way to MAINTAIN your floor!  I love that I don't have to sweep or vacuum first.Secondly, this was the solution to cleaning my laminate floors.  My husband was worried about using this, because if water seeps into the laminate flooring, it would be a problem.  I find that just enough cleaning fluid squirts out (since I have control) and then I vacuum a few times and the machine picks up 99% of the cleaning fluid.  This is sooooooooooo much easier than vacuuming, then squirting with Bona  (which is a good product), and then mopping.As far as cleaning, it takes me about five minutes to clean the machine, when I'm through.  I dump the dirty water into the toilet.  I then rinse out the dog hair and brushes in the kitchen sink.  I dry the brushes outside, and don't have any problems with moldy smell.I think the majority of haters are expecting this product to be a professional cleaning machine. It's not.  It has made my life a lot easier, and my floors look great. I'm happy!",4
David Kingsley,1.0 out of 5 stars,15 minutes a day?,the United States,19-Mar-19,CrossWave,,"I'm not a troll, really. I bought mine at Target. I am here to try to get the attention of Bissell Customer Service. I watched all the videos. I went through their silly telephone troubleshooting, and I had to hang up it was so bad. I requested an RMA (Return Material Authorization) through their customer support site and have not had a reply in over a week. As an engineer, I see what the issue is here, and it's not easily resolvable. In my experience, after about 15 minutes of use, suction suddenly stops. The internal filter clogs and needs to be removed and washed. Per Bissell instructions, you need to let it dry for 24 hours. So, 15 minutes of use each day. All of the reviews here complaining about streaks and mud are experiencing this sudden loss of suction. As a house cleaning tool, this is of no value to me. If you just need to clean up a spill every once in a while it would be useful. For $240, I'll use a mop for that. Perhaps having 2-3 filters to rotate through would help. Bissell, I'm waiting for your reply.",4
Karozans,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read this to know what to expect from this machine.,the United States,22-May-21,CrossWave,,"I purchased my Bissell from the Bissell website directly.  This product is really good concept, design, quality, but only for certain things.  Here is what you can expect.In my opinion, this machine is only good for quick and easy daily cleaning.  It works great against loose dirt and dust bunnies.  Basically a daily sweeper.  It also works great on very smooth surfaces as a mopper. Smooth porcelain and ceramic tiles, hard wood, linoleum, smooth epoxy, or polished and sealed concrete.I does NOT work very well for any textured floors as a mopper, but is pretty good for a sweeper.  Also it does NOT work well if your floors are very dirty with sticky spills.  It just doesn't put out enough liquid for heavy cleaning.  If your grout lines are uneven very much, it will hit the edge of the tile.On my textured tile floors, I had to use the rug feature because it was just taking far too long.  This of course filled up the reservoir very fast.  However, this machine does a wonderful job of cleaning.  The water was totally black and full of dust, dirt, hair, and junk.If Bissell offered a Heavy Duty version, I would be happy to pay $300 or $350 for it.  Here is what I think Bissell should do for a Heavy Duty grade sweeper/mopper that is good for heavy duty cleaning in the home.1.  Move the cleaner and waste reservoir off the machine and put into a seperate tank that is on wheels.  It can carry 1 gallon of cleaner, and one gallon of waste.  Make it where the tanks are sealed in case you turn it over, or if you need to empty the waste, but still have fresh cleaner left.2.  Make the electrical cord go into the separate tank, then bundle all 3 hoses into a single cord (electrical, fresh, waste return) that goes to the sweeper/mopper handle.3.  Make the sweeper/mopper brushes 4 to 6 inches wider. and a bit bigger in diameter.4.  Make a heavy duty version of the scrubber/mopper rotating heads that is for really scrubbing hard tiles floors in the kitchen.",One
Hogchoker,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of the worst investments we've made,the United States,21-Jul-21,CrossWave,,"My fiance and i bought one of these because we work extremely long hours, have a lot of vinyl floor space and two dogs that pick up a fair amount of dirt.  Granted, its not the pet model, but we weren't expecting a miracle, just something to help us keep on top of cleaning a little better with our tight schedules.  This thing was the exact opposite.  A swiffer can do what it does for the hard surfaces, it ruined several rugs and the amount of time spent cleaning the product itself basically doubled our overall cleaning time.  After about the tenth time trying to clean a rug with it, we threw it into the back of the junk closet and haven't touched it since.",One
Squishy,5.0 out of 5 stars,My floors are finally clean,the United States,17-Jun-21,CrossWave,,"My home is full of laminate flooring. I would typically mop once a week with a swiffer wet jet and my feet were constantly getting black and dirty, tracking onto the area rugs. I purchased the Crosswave and it's getting everything the swiffer was leaving behind. The dirty water this sucks back up is proof of how well this is working. There's even a window near the brush head that you can see if the area your mopping is pulling up dirt still.It does take longer for me, than a conventional mop. But I rather have something take more time if it's actually effective. It doesn't get close to edges and it can't vacuum my ruggable rugs, they're too thin and it creates too much suction. I haven't used this as an actual vacuum, I make sure to run my Roomba before mopping with this. With 3 pets, I wouldn't want to deal with cleaning wet hair out of this machine.",
irish,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life Changer, no, seriously.",the United States,12-Jul-18,CrossWave,,"So I typically don't write a bunch of reviews, unless the item is a complete waste of time/money or a life changer. This one is a life changer.  I am not a huge fan of cleaning, but I like a clean house. Anything to save time and effort is great.  This is one of those products.  When I say it has changed my life, I do mean it (though on a relatively small level).  I purchased this in Sept 2017, right before we listed our house to sell.  I have a 7 year old and a two year old, and to say they are messy is an understatement.  I also have a medium hair cat and a wiry hair dog.  In the house we were selling, I had hand scraped look laminate flooring in the living areas and linoleum in the kitchen.  I honestly don't know what I would have done if I had had to sweep and mop the floors each time we showed the house; typically there is not much notice when a realtor wants to show.  I literally was using every bit of time I had to clean up almost daily.  This probably saved me as much as 45 minutes each time I used it.  Now we are in a rental and have tile floors in much of the downstairs area.  It doesn't get the grout as well, so about once a month I take a very wet mop and hit the high traffic areas.  It also does not pick up those tougher spots, such as candy, forgotten small spills, etc.  I will spray these or hit them with the mop first- basically what I did when I used a mop and bucket.  The water is GROSS every time I clean, so I know it is getting the yuck.  The floors look good, and typically it only takes 15-20 minutes (as compared to 45min to 1 hour).  It has great suction- so you need to make sure anything you don't want to be pulled in is off the floor.  I put a strainer on the sink when I dump it so all the garbage doesn't go in the drain.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't get super close to the wall/cabinets.  I will do a quick sweep in the areas that get a lot of stuff in these areas.  \  As far as clean up, it is super easy but pretty important.  If you are in a hurry and don't rinse the collection container, expect it to be stinky the next time you use it (especially if it was for a milk spill- don't say I didn't warn you!).  The brush DOES need to be rinsed frequently on floors that show streaks- you will get a much better result.  It has a nifty little plate that it sets on after you clean up so that the water does not drain and create a puddle.  So if you are on the fence about this, well I hope my review helps make a decision.  I have literally told anyone that cleans about this, and I seriously think they believe I am a salesperson for Bissell.  No; I have had other Bissell products that were ok but not like this.  Do I recommend?  HIGHLY!",2
Jeanne Piper-Myers,1.0 out of 5 stars,lousy product,the United States,23-Nov-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,This product does not have the suction it claims. Too much water remains on surface.I would like to know what possibility there is to return this item.,25
A.V.P,4.0 out of 5 stars,Anyone who doesn't like cleaning... needs this!!,the United States,16-Nov-18,CrossWave,,"Nothing is ever perfect and this product doesn't come without it's flaws (or inconveniences) but I would happily take it. Our house is 2700 sq ft with tile floor/ hardwood on the entire downstairs and some upstairs.  We have a messy dog (Golden Retriever) that sheds to the max (we love him anyways).  I've been looking for a 2 in 1 (vacuum and mop)... I Hate mopping!!  It's just a lot of floor downstairs to clean then go through and repeat the same process.  Comes the answer to my prayers!  Don't expect Dyson or Shark quality suction, or chunky dog  kibbles to be picked up. Still, it picked up all the hairs and it did a good job as a vacuum.  As for mopping, I did have to run through certain sections plenty of times to get  rid of the dried debris and stains. I don't have a lot of patience so there are parts I did finish cleaning with my Steam Mop, but those were minimal. The machine is lightweight which is a big deal for me.  I am petite and was able to maneuver this machine very easily.  Depending on how dirty the floors are, expect to run through the same section a couple of times until it looks visibly clean.  My floors are mostly tile but I noticed the Rug setting dispenses more solution which helped speed up the cleaning process. The tiles look clean but don't think it did much for the grout.  The water solution and the dirty water tank will run out quickly in each room.  Expect to clean the dirty water tank plenty of times to empty the bin, the holding capability is for a small room.  The manual assembly was incredibly easy.. although I watched many videos on YouTube about it before it arrived.  I bought this to use as a maintenance tool (everyday) but I do recommend giving a deep cleaning to the house a couple of times per month.  I'm loving how lightweight it is and if cleaning the dirty tank bin is the only real task, I'll happily take in if it'll save me from repeating the entire process!!",One
amanda,1.0 out of 5 stars,This machine is the pits!!!,the United States,20-Aug-20,CrossWave,,"I was so excited about a floor cleaner that didn’t not require vacuuming first.  Boy was I wrong about this machine. The amount of time I spend cleaning this machine and brush that is full of liquid, dirt and hair, is 10 times longer and 100 times more repulsive, than just vacuuming the tile and using the steam mop. I cannot understand how this machine got so many excellent reviews. The vacuum definitely has adequate suction for a hard floor but it’s truly terrible on carpeting. Save your money because this machine will disappoint you.",2
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth the Effort,the United States,8-Oct-17,CrossWave,,"This was a great product, in theory. But whatever ""convenience"" there is in spraying water down and vacuuming at the same time goes out the window when it comes to cleaning it (and if you don't clean it right away, expect a vile stench to cause you to vomit within a few hours or day). Think about it, you're vacuuming up dust, dirt, debris - and then letting it float in a closed container of water. It's disgusting! When it comes to using the traditional mop, yah, you get a bucket of dirty water, but if you have vacuumed first, you won't have debris floating in your bucket, just dust and miniscule dirt. So you can throw that bucket of dirty water straight into the drain. Not so without the Crosswave. You'll have a canister of water filled with debris that was vacuumed up. You cannot dump that into a drain because it'll eventually clog! So somehow, you have to use paper towels to catch the debris as you pour out the water very carefully, or use some sort of strainer to catch the debris and hope the small pieces don't go down the drain. It takes a good 30 minutes at least to clean the canister, filter, and roller, all the while, you are at the point of puking at the sight and smell of it all. I would rather vacuum first, and then mop (or steam mop) afterwards.But if you have absolutely no problem doing the post clean-up (which again, offsets any convenience of a 2-in-1), then there are some things Bissell could improve. For starters, the trigger to spray water is right on the handle that you grip, so more often than not, I inadvertently am spraying water when I don't want to. There are also times where you are not pulling the spray trigger but there is water still in the bay, which still wets whatever you're vacuuming (and if that's a rug or carpet, that's not cool). Moreover, spraying water on the floor is not the same as mopping - I have no idea how this could be considered ""mopping"". I don't mind it being what it is, but we shouldn't call it mopping, maybe just ""refreshing""? All you're doing is spraying water down, and then having the vacuum rub against it and hopefully the warmth and friction will dry it up after about 10 runs over that square foot you're working on. Imagine doing that for an entire floor. Tedious! Also, you can add their scented water products to the vacuum and spray it out (the orange stuff), but it doesn't disinfect. So all you're doing is adding a slight scent to the floors. It'd be a whole lot nicer to get something that disinfects, because if that's what your goal is, you might as well be using a steam mop (some people do use vinegar solution in their water, and that definitely helps more than scented water, but it's still not exactly disinfecting).",3
Imagine,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed after a month,the United States,30-Mar-19,CrossWave,,"I wish I could give the crosswave 5 stars! It is a great vacuum and has become my go to cleaning machine.  At first, it felt like I was not saving time at all and it took forever to clean my 4 bedroom home.  I did see some streaks on the floor, but not like other reviewers mentioned.  The streaks are due to your floors being dirty (so I thought, see update). I clean daily and my floor was dirty, and I get dirty water out of canister daily.  I use it every night throughout the house, and touch up in the am as needed.  My one complain is that it does not deep clean stuck on messes or grout.  It does a great job, don't get me wrong.  But I have used the different rolls and even when I go over stuck on messes several times, I still have to use a knife or my nails.  But I would have done the same with a broom, mop, other vacuum, etc.  What makes this machine better than all those things is that you are picking up dirt, sand, food particles, dust, hair, etc while also mopping your floors. And you aren't using a dirty wet rag to just move dirty water around.  Would highly recommend. I just wish Bissell would come out with a harder bristle brush for grout.***Update***It’s been a month and a half and I’m very dissapointed with this machine. Crosswave started losing suction and leaving the disgusting dirty streaks some people were talking about. Then it just stopped suctioning water all together, so the brush would just keep rotating dirty water. I read manual and recommendations on bissell’s website. Cleaned every part out and still no suction. Thankfully I read in a post to make sure water tank and filter “clicked” when putting in place. Still nothing but that lead me to think filter needed to be replaced even though I clean it daily. I replaced it and problem solved. Machine started sunctioning water again. Sucks that filter won’t last more than a month. It seems to have warped after a few washings.  However, even after suctioning issue was solved, I’m still seeing streaks everywhere. I clean the machine out often, wipe the wheels, and bottom strip. Nothing! Still leaves streaks. I have light-medium traffic in our home and we take our shoes off at door the majority of time. We have some renovations being done, but not to the point where this machine shouldn’t be able to handle the dirt/dust when it’s advertised to pick up much worse things. I stopped using it daily and now using it weekly. I have to sweep, vacuum, then mop every night. On weekends I take out crosswave and use it so that I don’t feel like I’m spreading dirty water around. I do two passes throughout house and still get streaks even when water dries. I have to go back with a mop. So frustrating.",One
Julia Felix,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Purchase I’ve Made in Years,the United States,6-Jan-20,CrossWave,,"I was so excited about this vacuum. We have a 14 month old baby who just learned how to walk a couple of months ago, and I already knew it was going to be a challenge keeping the floors clean enough for him to walk around all the time, as my husband is a little messy and we also have a little Pomeranian. I watched a ton of review videos to make sure it was going to do what I wanted and saw that it works on all types of floors and also vacuums area rugs. It looked perfect, and I convinced my husband it’s okay to spend $300 on a vacuum if it is going to do all this!The first handful of uses were great! It had great suction, scrubbed the floors fairly well (with a little more emphasis on the sides of the roller instead of the middle, but it worked enough), and left everything looking sparking clean and smelling pleasant. I was a little disappointed that after each use you’re supposed to clean the vacuum by running it in it’s special holder with clean water a few times, but it made sense and I figured that it probably keeps it in good working order.However, after about 3 weeks (probably about 5 or 6 uses in a small 3 bedroom apartment) I noticed the suction wasn’t great, to the point where it wasn’t even able to pick up 2cm bits of felt or the little bits of paper from my husbands’ piano work. The “no tangle” brush roll had a bunch of hair tangled in it, and the wheels were leaving dirt tracks all over the place that the vacuum then struggled to clean. I should mention here that I usually clean the floors once or twice a week, so it’s not like the place is disgusting, there’s no mud or broken eggs or cereal like in the commercials. This is just normal scraps of things, hair, leaves, and dirt that gets tracked around.The next time I used it, I finally had to tear a bunch of hair off the brush roll so it could function again, and in the process realized the whole suction part was clogged up with hair and all the little things that one tends to vacuum off the floor. I had to pull it all out with my hands, then clean the entire thing very thoroughly. It was very gross. I thought that must be why the suction was bad and hoped that fixed all the issues.Next time I used it, I noticed it was spitting out things I had vacuumed in one room while I was vacuuming in different rooms. The dirty wheel problem was worse, and the vacuum started just leaving puddles of dirty water underneath when you stopped moving it for too long, including on my brand new rug! And of course by this point it didn’t really clean the rugs at all, just rubbed them with dirty water and left debris all over the place.This last time I used it, I realized it was now blowing dirt away instead of vacuuming it up.  This and all the other issues made me finally decided to write a review to warn people not to get this vacuum. It seems so great, but if a fairly clean house can kill it within a few weeks, it is clearly garbage. I’m so disappointed and embarrassed, and not looking forward to having to tell my husband how much of a waste of money this was :(",
Beth R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Floors MUCH cleaner since I got this,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave,,"This has been the best purchase I've made in awhile. My wood look tile floors have been so much cleaner. I have 3 toddlers and they're a huge mess obviously.  I used to vacuum, then mop with a spin mop. It took more time and effort than I'd like. This thing solved my problem. I have a couple tricks that make it work REALLY well.1. I use a spray pump to quickly spray soapy water all over the floor and let it sit for a few minutes2. Fill bissell with clean water (i don't use the bissell cleaner)3. Slowly run bissell over wet floor to suck up soapy waterThis works great. I've tested it by scrubbing a freshly cleaned spot with a bsby wipe and it comes up clean. Allowing the water to sit in the floor for a few minutes is key to getting ut clean with this thing. If you skip that step, the crosswave doesn't do that great a job in my experience. Definitely recommend though. This has cut my floor cleaning in half (or more) and my floor has been very clean!",One
LJC,2.0 out of 5 stars,Mine burnt up after a year,the United States,13-Nov-20,CrossWave + Multi-Surface Pet,,"Bought this exactly one year ago. I used it everyday on my tile and laminate floors. Did a wonderful job but as I said, its 1 year old and the motor just burnt up in it.",10
AJ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to edit my glowing review. It sucks, not in the good way.",the United States,12-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"Edit....after 2 years, I have finally given up on this thing, and I'm changing my review. It started out GREAT. It worked like it was supposed to until it didn't. I noticed my floors not getting clean. I used the recommended solution, and even bought new mop heads. I gave up and got a Shark steam mop. The picture is the floor after using the steam mop on the right, and the dirt this product failed to clean on the left. The other picture is what the mop head looked like after a couple back and forthcoming in the living room. Inexcusable.I feel I have made a life-saving purchase with this item.I have a home with all wood and tile floors. I also have two cats and a dog, all rescues. I have an evil cat, Gabby, who, in particular, likes to make my home as nasty as possible. She is the spawn of Satan. She likes, for example, to wait until 3 am and start puking up something random. Then, she somehow convinces the others to walk in it and traffic it everywhere. If she were a human, the government would have stopped her years ago. I have gone through mop after mop, usually of the spin variety, which always ends up not spinning in the end. I was shopping for another mop and decided that since I was old enough to adopt evil into my house, I needed a grown-up mop. The money will be saved in the long run over buying those expensive and worthless spin mops.EDIT: I see other reviews complaining about it not being a great vacuum. It will NOT take the place of a regular vacuum. It only grabs dust, small dirt and, of course, hair. It will not, for example, suck up all your child's legos to teach them a lesson about picking up their infernal toys. It will, however, clean up the small things so the mop works without getting clogged. Keep the Dyson handy for the Cheetos and toenails.It is convenient when someone is coming over, as I can run it over my floors very quickly without any issue.",3
DJ DOGGO,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Broken TWICE, Bissell customer service is a joke",the United States,25-Dec-19,CrossWave,,"Do NOT buy this machine. Bought in July, by the end of November it had broken down completely. Was leaving muddy puddles of water everywhere, barely sucking any of the water up and completely dumping everything back on the floor once it was turned off. No, it was not clogged. Yes, brush and filter had been changed. Bissell gave me the run around until I got on their Facebook and stated my issue, at which point they offered to replace it. It has been almost a month since we got the replacement, and it is ALREADY doing the same mess. I also noticed this time, when I rinse out the hose to the dirty container, water gushes out the back. Probably not supposed to happen. So done with this product, and Bissell will not do anything to make this right. They clearly made a defective product and just keep selling it to people for almost $300. Just say no.",One
J. Alexander,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke shortly after warranty expired,the United States,2-Jun-20,CrossWave,,"I purchased the Bissell Crosswave Model 1785T in November 2017.  I probably used it about twice a month and I would always clean it every time I used it.  In March 2020 it stopped sucking up the dirty water.  It spread filthy water on the floor that I had to mop up the old fashioned way.  After paying $250 for the Crosswave in 2017, I had to pay an additional $90 to have it fixed just over two years later.One month after I got it fixed, the brush stopped spinning.  I called Bissell customer service and asked if they would honor the warranty.  (They wouldn't.)  Bissell wouldn't even send me a replacement piece so I could fix it myself.  I really liked the Crosswave when it was working, but it is expensive to fix when it breaks and Bissell does not stand behind their product.  Buyer beware.",One
Mrs. S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep cleaned our martial arts tarp style mat - amazing!,the United States,16-Feb-19,CrossWave,,"I actually bought this thing in a store - I was trying to figure out a way to deep clean our gym mats since there was a lot of buildup from people's sweat plus dirt, etc. And it was affecting how we did our breakfalls  The only video I saw online that  demonstrated this kind of deep clean used an industrial type scrubbing machine but I don't have that kind of money. The difference in the mats before and after is impressive - we have the black tarp vinyl mats and this vacuum was gentle enough to not damage them in the least and managed to make them like new. We avoided the overlapped parts to not damage the seal, but otherwise did a space of about 30x30 but we had to get an extension cord. We went over the space once, and did a spot a second time to see to see if any more grime came up and nope! The water came up clean, which is also impressive because the first pass it came out literally black. As far as solution, we just got an extra bottle of the Bissell multisurface floor  cleaner -  the kind that comes in a sample size in the box. I'm so glad we got this machine!",One
Ozzallos,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost Perfect,the United States,8-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"My wife got a recommendation to buy this from an OCD friend, which was probably as good as an endorsement as any. Sure enough, the Crosswave delivers. The first thing that we noted was how simplistic everything is laid out. There's two ergonomic buttons to denote hard floor and carpet cleaning within the reach of your thumb, the cleaning fluid canister clearly marks water to cleaner ratios for you and disassembly is easy and straight forward. It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to be up and cleaning your floor within five minutes.For such a thin, light unit, the suction is amazing and fully capable of sucking up any excess water, dirt or dirty water. Apply as much of the cleaning solution as desired through with each pass and watch the floor you thought was clean actually become clean. Our unit included three different brush types for smooth, tile and wood floors, as well as cleaning solution for each. Since most of outr 1700sqft hous is tile, we're using that one and it works perfectly. Even the plastic storage base which appears merely decorative at first is very practical, severing as both anti-drip tray, cleaning station and roller storage.No product is perfect, but the Crosswave is pretty darn close. The cord is shorter than the Shark this is replacing, but it's much, MUCH lighter. After use, the Crosswave tends to drip slightly and since you just cleaned a dirty floor, you get dirty drips... Which is why you use the base tray to park your vacuum during idle. And that's it. We're pretty happy with the product. Admittedly we haven't tried it much on carpet given the layout of our domicile, but it's performance on tile is exemplary.",2
Lynn Van Deusen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheaply made,the United States,12-Oct-20,CrossWave,,"Purchased 3 months ago. When you put in cleaner bottle, it leaks water all over the place. evidentially it stops leaking. The suctions is horrible. there are dirty rivers of water after you go over the floor. Mine does not pick up any water. The battery only last approximately 20 minutes. I have a very small home and my fiance has a small home. His is porcelain textured tile throughout the whole house. Mine is Linoleum and porcelain tile smooth.Be very careful, when walking....as the rivers of water are extremely slippery.After waiting hours between charges to continue the floors, and finally complete them, I took a white paper towel damp, and wipe the floor.

Australian Shepherds Rock,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not great if you have pets with long hair....,the United States,9-Oct-17,CrossWave,,"I recently purchased the Cross Wave from another retailer. If I was writing a review for just cleaning tile and hard wood floors, it would be a five star review. This machine is very effective on tile and hardwood floors. I have Australian Shepherds, with long hair. Even though the CrossWave has vacuuming capability, I did vacuum the area rugs very well with the vacuum before using the Cross Wave. Even with vacuuming first, it was necessary to take the machine apart and clean it multiple times while cleaning three area rugs. The good news is that it picks up dog hair that the vacuum didn't, the bad news is that it clogs the machine quickly. I have been impressed with the CrossWave for effectiveness for cleaning hardwood and tile floors. If you purchase this product and have pets with long hair, definitely plan to vacuum really well first before using the CrossWave. Update: I no longer recommend at all. I had the CrossWave for about three months. It stopped working completely. I followed the instructions for a complete cleaning after each use. It appears that even with this that dog hair was getting pulled back into the bearing that turns the brush. I have tried to free all the hair, but it still is not working. Going back to store, as it is still under warranty. I have had this problem with other Bissell products too. Just not designed for dog hair. It can be done, I don't have the same problem with other brands.",5
Philip G Koshy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent but not great,the United States,24-Feb-19,CrossWave,,"I have mixed feelings about this product. Prior to getting it, we used a vaccuum and then a swiffer sweep, which was time consuming. I hated using the swiffer because if any amount of dust was on the floor, the thing would make the dust wet and then just move it around the floor, getting into our grout. I was really excited to find the bissell because it not only washes the floor but sucks in the dust so it's not trekking around the floor. I definitely prefer it to my old method, but it leaves much to be desired.Pros:1. Very easy to assemble/disassemble since everything snaps in place.2. Does a decent job sucking in the dirt so it's not just being smeared across your floor as you clean. Definitely saves time since I don't need to vacuum beforehand unless the house is really dirty. Unfortunately the suction isn't that strong so anything more than some dust or feathers (we have a bird) and it won't pick it up. While it does suck in the dust bunnies, it takes several passes to get them to stop being pushed around the floor and get sucked into the machine.3. Relatively light and easy to maneuver in most places.Cons:1. The container for the cleaning fluid and the container for catching dirty water have grossly mismatched capacities. It would make sense if they were the same so that when I ran out of fluid, I would then go empty the dirty water. Instead, 3/4 of the way through, I have to stop and pour out the dirty water, only to have to refill the fluid container a few minutes later. At least if they made the dirty water container larger, I would have the option of doing the disassembly in one go.2. The high-pitched noise is really annoying when the dirty water container reaches capacity, but there is absolutely no indication when you run out of cleaning fluid. It takes a good several minutes to realize that you've been vacuuming with just the water left on the brush.3. The vacuum is physically incapable of getting close to walls, leaving about a 2 inch perimeter of unclean floor around every room. It also can't be folded flat, so you can't really get under furniture with it.4. If you disassemble and rinse it immediately after use, it's pretty easy to deal with. If you are in a rush and leave it uncleaned, you will spend a bunch of time scrubbing it. This whole disassembly and cleaning regimen makes my SO (who favors the swiffer due to this) not want to use the vaccuum.5. You absolutely need to make sure the bottom of the vaccuum and the filter are clean. I made the mistake of not checking the filter and had a bunch of dirty, streaky water keep spewing out as I was cleaning. The bottom of the vaccuum tends to pick up dirt and if you are cleaning a large room, it will eventually start smudging across the floor.",One
Dennis Sweet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hassle to clean out.,the United States,14-Jun-19,CrossWave,,"I've used my Bissel Crosswave for about a year now, and it's honestly a hassle every time I use it. Owning pets, our floor gets very dirty very quickly. Pet hair, waste, and muddy footprints in every room was quickly becoming an issue. So, we bought a Crosswave in hopes that it would help! Cleaning is no issue, it takes about fifteen minutes to clean the entire floor, and it does a very good job. The cleaning solution given plus a brush designed for pet hair really helped! But when I'm all done using it, I absolutely dread cleaning it out.Unless you love the smell of mildew all over your house from the Crosswave, you need to clean it regularly if you have pets. I'm talking after every use. Not just taking the brush out, washing it, and emptying the tank. An actual wash out. See, the wet pet hair and mud clumps together in the internals of the Crosswave and creates a gunky, thick buildup of material that smells awful and mildews quickly. If you don't clean it the day of using it by taking apart every piece and taking a toothbrush to get into the hard to reach places, you can say goodbye to a nice smelling Crosswave. I've learned by experience that allowing the material inside the Crosswave to harden and sit without cleaning it immediately results in what I can only describe as the smell of a sewer. It takes about ten minutes to actually CLEAN OUT the device once used, which is an enormous hassle. A fifteen minute use followed by ten minutes of maintenance? Not worth it. Would not recommend, just because of how ridiculous the maintenance is.Cleans well though.",2

April Pancone,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a great find!,the United States,8-Jul-19,CrossWave,,"I will warn this could be a lengthy review, but I promise it’s worth reading! I had a Hoover Floormate for about 5 years, and to no fault of its own, it broke. So I started to research a new hard floor cleaner, and came across the Bissell Crosswave. I read reviews and took into account the good and bad, not just on the Bissell but the Hoover as well. I finally chose the Bissell. Wow! I can’t believe what I was missing. And I’m here to say, I loved my Floormate! The Crosswave completely blew me away. Fist off, it’s super light, found it to be very easy to transport up and down stairs. But the cleaning! I have a large area of tile that it easily cleaned and in very little time. I felt Iike I was using my dyson, but with soap and water. Not only that but the drying was remarkable. It left more of a dampness on the floor which quickly dried. In fact I have two dogs and a 6 year old that I’m always trying to keep off floors while they dry and I didn’t have to do that at all. It dried that fast! I. Ever refilled the tank during this time which I would have sometimes up to three times with the Floormate. It was crazy good at sucking up dirt debris which previously I would have grabbed my Dyson to do first. I’m so happy I made the decision to get this! You will not be disappointed if you go this route as well. If for the sake of just saying something that could be improved, I would recommend Bissell to enhance the cord length. But honestly, it wasn’t really even an issue either. Love, love, love!!!",2
Aaron F.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"PLEASE BISSELL, FIX THE BRUSH ROLLER BEARING DESIGN !!",the United States,31-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"It pains me to only give this 1 star.  I have been a crosswave owner since day one but the problem I keep having is with the bearing that drives the roller brush, after 6-8 months it rusts and seize's up. Bissell replaced one machine under warranty but now the replacement has been sitting dead for months with the same problem.  I love this thing for my tile floors when its working but it keeps breaking.  The bearing is not easily replaceable either it seems to be pressed onto the shaft with a special piece of plastic molded onto the end that fits into the end of the brush roller.  If Bissell could make it easy to replace this $2.50 bearing, I would gladly buy a bunch of bearings and swap them out twice a year.  Or they need to make a better seal so the water isnt getting in the bearing, something.  Please Bissell fix this flaw with your machines.  You almost have a great product.  BTW if your machine starts for a few seconds and then shuts down this is your problem too.  Once that bearing sieze's up the machine will try and run for a short time but since the motor is trying to spin and cant some type of overload protection kicks in and shuts the machine down. If you let it rest for a minute it will repeat the process.",2
Public,3.0 out of 5 stars,FIve stars or three?...a split decision.,the United States,27-Aug-17,CrossWave,,"This unit is great for general cleaning...not major crud removal. I hoped it would clean 10 years of dirt embdded in my floor tile grout...but I was wrong. The hard-floor  brush only has a few hard bristle-tufts which are good for general all-around cleaning, but not for major jobs. After using it on floor grout for about 30 minutes, the wash water was very dirty...but the grout was only slightly cleaner. Bottom line: the machine is great for general cleaning, but wimpy when the dirt is heavy and ground-in.After researching grout cleaning on the web, it seems the pros use either a pressure washer/vacuum floor machine or a high-pressure steam cleaner. Both are very expensive ($1000 and up) and a commercial cleaning company charges by the square foot. I already own a 2800 psi pressure washer, but I suspect my wife would probably object to using it in on the the living room tile (wives are funny that way). Commercial cleaners are riduculously expensive, so I'll probably rent a high pressure-steam machine to clean off the major dirt and then use the Bissell to maintain the floor...not produce miracles.",3
Andrea,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hate it. Doesn’t seem to really clean.,the United States,25-Feb-18,CrossWave,,"Originally I was looking for something better than my Swiffer Wet Jet for my stained concrete floors. I came across this and saw nothing but great reviews so I went and picked one up. I have some area rugs as well as two dogs. My main issue is really cleaning my floors, especially marks from shoes and when my dogs come in from outside. I often have a mix of dead grass and dirt because of them.At first I thought this thing was awesome and was getting ready to throw out my Dyson Pet vacuum and Wet Jet. After a few more uses with more of a mess it completely let me down. I don’t have too much dog hair around because I frequently use a hand vac but the little the Crosswave did come into contact with (along with dust and grime from shoes or whatever else) clogged it right up and made it just give up.After a few rainy days my dogs and family tracked a good bit of mud into the house. I brought out the Crosswave and it did not seem to pick up any of the paw/foot tracks easily; whether they were wet or dry made no different. If anything it seemed to somewhat wet the ground and smear the mess around. I can tell you for a fact it wasn’t actually cleaning, despite a wet ground drying eventually and taking time on all the tracks, white socks clearly said otherwise. Disgusting.I’d spray solution it wouldn’t spray evenly. I don’t understand what the problem is. I have to take apart this machine and clean all its parts but it clogs right up. The stuff clogging it up is barley anything.This does absolutely nothing on my area rugs, no matter the length or type of rug. I tried to clean them with this and realized it didn’t do a very good job. So I got out my Dyson and it picked up a lot more than I even expected. The Crosswave did nothing.The cleaning solution leaves smudge marks on my floor worse than the Swiffer solution. Not a good lookThis machine is extremely overpriced. I regret buying it. Don’t let the reviews and videos fool you. Sure, maybe it does work great when you have a “perfect” consolidated mess but in the real world it far from makes the cut. I plan to use it one last time to make a video showing how much it fails since every other review must be sponsored by Bissell.",3
KDWJT22,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great at first, but doesn’t last",the United States,24-Jun-21,CrossWave,,"I bought the crosswave directly from Bissell when it first came out. I loved it. It was wonderful being able to vacuum and mop the floors all at the same time vs sweeping then mopping. Pro: It really cut down in time. Con: You are supposed to take the roller, filter, tank and all attached parts off after each use and clean. When you have toddlers and a geriatric blind yorkie who doesn’t  always find their way to the potty pad, you need to clean the floors multiple times a day. The filter/rollers don’t dry quickly so purchasing additional filters and rollers to switch them out for multiple uses is necessary.My crosswave didn’t last the three months of the warranty so I returned it and bissell sent a replacement.  I had problems with streaking, suction, and the solution tank was leaking all the solution/water.  I hoped this was an isolated thing but unfortunately I had the same experience with the replacement. It’s too bad it doesn’t last, I love the concept.",
Greg,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell crosswave and a Hoover FloorMate comparison,the United States,16-Sep-17,CrossWave,,"Picked up this Bissell crosswave after having a Hoover FloorMate for quite a few months.  After reading various reviews and watching different videos on the two machines, for my use it seems like the Bissell crosswave would be a better machine and I wanted to compare the difference between the FloorMate spin scrub brushes and the cross wave roller brush.For reference, I have a husky dog which sheds quite a bit and also tracks dirt and dust into the kitchen area where we allow him to stay and where his crate is placed.  With the Hoover FloorMate, it would take some effort to get the floor dry after washing and sucking up the liquid left on the area after cleaning. In comparison, the crosswave seems to do a better job of picking up the cleaning water. I can clean the floor in my socks and my socks will not be damp after because the crosswave does such a good job of drying the floor.Cleaning the machine is very easy also. The dirty water cup is easily removed at the front of the machine and you can take out the roller brush to rinse out under the sink. Even with pet hair, the hair does not seem to stick to the brush or the inside of the machine.  With the Hoover FloorMate, I would vacuum the area quite a bit before cleaning the floor, but I don't find this necessary with the crosswave unless there are large debris on the floor.  With both machines, the dirty water cup always has lots of dirty water, so I have no doubt that they both clean very well, but the crosswave is a little more convenient because of its weight, maneuverability, and the way that it is able to dry the floor while cleaning.",2
Allison Brock,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I had bought it sooner!!,the United States,13-Jan-19,CrossWave,,I bought this yesterday at target because I wanted to try it out this weekend and I have probably never been so impressed with the purchase. You can see from the pictures that it clearly got up a lot of dirt but what you can’t tell is that I’ve vacuumed and mopped the traditional way just three days ago and we had a cleaner a few days before that.  I did this two days apart and it still got up more dirt. It leaves the floors clean without any residue at all and the cleaner that comes from Bissel smells amazing.  You can actually order the strainer for the tank that comes with the pet one from the Bissell for 9.99. I wanted the Pat one but they didn’t have that in stock and from all of the things I’ve read online that is basically the only difference.,2
Mike,1.0 out of 5 stars,Won't last long - less than a year,the United States,1-Oct-19,CrossWave,,"Same situation as most; lasts only a few months and now won't power on at all. Bissell's unhelpful videos show for this issue to remove handle, check cable for breaks and plug back in. Not sure what they think we'd use this device for that would result in cable breaks. Took unit apart and all looks well and clean, but just won't power up. Too expensive to buy another just to have it only last a few months to happen again.It's ashame since while it was running, it worked well; better than our hoover floormates, but at least we have a floormate for backup.One thing that has outlasted all of these units is the good old mop and bucket. ;-)Advice to self, if I ever buy another system like this, check to see if parts are sold first, otherwise I'll just be paying Bissell for me to transport it to the trash.",One
A. Holloway,5.0 out of 5 stars,We love it! Perfect for regular cleaning!!,the United States,1-Dec-18,CrossWave,,"I have only had this for less than a week. The reason it is not listed as a verified Amazon purchase is because i purchased it from Bissell because i got a special deal. That being said if you want to see that i am a good Amazon customer you can click on my name and see my history with Amazon.  Ok so we have half tile in our house and half carpet. We have a great Bissell rug shampooer but we needed something for our tiles and for perhaps a period spill on the carpet without dragging out the bigger machine.  Up until recently we tried several different tile steam cleaners, mops, and a whole array of their things to try and keep the tile half way decent.  My husband and i are both disabled vets and in our 70's and frankly I am tired of...sweeping, dusting, vacuuming, mopping, re-vacuuming just to keep the tile half way decent. So I wanted to give it a try.  Easy to put together so no problems there.  Directions are also easy. On the top of the handle there are 2 buttons, hardfloor and carpet.  Push whichever one you are going to do.  First I did all of the tile which goes from the kitchen, hallway, and foyer.  It really worked way better than i expected.  There were 2 or 3 bits that had been stuck on the tile and i did have to scrape that off. However, considering (as i said) i had to dry mop/dust the tile, wet mop or swiffer the tile. Then have to go back over with a vacuum to get any web dust bunnies up.  this got everything up except those few stuck on bits.  Some people might consider that a negative but it did so well on every other part of it i really can't hold that against it.  The container you put the water or cleaner in is easy to get in and out and fill.  I did all the tile and that and 2 areas on the carpet that I wanted to spot clean.  Yep, perfect.  Don't plan on using this as a deep carpet cleaner but for a few spots here and there it does the job.  It has a long cord, easy to deal with.  I watched a youtube to make sure i could get the cleaning roll out correctly, easy, take the top part off, lift the roller out and wash it OR you can use the washing tray.  I then rinsed the inside of the roller container area which had loads of dusty and such and it rinsed easily.  The cup container where the dirty water and bits go was easy to remove and wash out and place back in.  Haven't tried picking up spaghetti as they show in the advertisement but there i did have some dirt  and things on the floor (put there for testing too) and it came out a real winner. Picked up everything and washed the spot as well.  So I see some people gave it a negative because it did not clean up caked on mud and things but honestly, for us that is not what we are looking for. So if you are looking for something to get on even a few times a week to vacuum/dust/wash the floors then this is for you. I think if you are looking for a workhorse to vacuum and wash up caked on mud etc. then I don't think they make a combination machine that will do that yet.  For us it is perfect. If as time goes by there are any problems or concerns i will update.",
Laura  A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell Crosswave,the United States,1-Jan-18,CrossWave,,"Although I didn't buy the Bissell Crosswave at Amazon ($40 cheaper online at Bed Bath and Beyond when you use the 20% off first time buyer or BB&B other coupons), I wanted to review this product because I just love it!I used it for the first time today and I am so pleased with the results. Vacuumed and washed all my floors in under 45 minutes and no dragging buckets and mops or having to redo floors (as in, vacuum first then wash). It cleaned the tile floor in the bathroom nicely, getting even the grout. In the roll-in shower it sucked up the hair in the drain (nasty!) and toothpaste blobs (even nastier!) in one easy pass. It picked up kitty litter and cleaned the litter mat equally well.With the flick of a button the unit switches between hard floors and carpet. In the bedroom living room and kitchen it made everything so much easier. It has lots of suction, picking up up not only the litter but also leaves that blow inside everytime the doors open. It sucked up the lighter floor mats (as well as my slipper!) but what does one expect? You want suction? Well, that's what suction does! 🤣It is more lightweight than the Bissell vacuum I bought 18 months ago (still a good machine) even though you have 2 on board tanks - one for  the cleaning solution and one for the dirty, used solution and everything else.Yes, you do have to wash out that dirty tank (very yucky) and rinse the brush (although it has a brush cleaner in the base of the storage caddy for light duty.) In my book it's a small exchange for the  heavier labor of a mop and bucket! The discard tank snaps easily on and off, as does the cleaning solution tank.My unit was easy to assemble and came with a quick start guide and an instruction manual, neither of which have I even glanced at yet! Also included were one installed brush and two spares, one of which is different from the one that came installed. I guess I'll have to look at the manual after all!I do consider the cleaning solution to be rather pricey, even though it is concentrated and the fill line for the ""larger area"" (up to 700 square feet) looks to be a cup or or maybe somewhat less. It did last up to 700 square feet, as indicated on the fill tank guides.  My house is 650 square feet and there is some left in the tank, even though I have a heavy hand with the trigger. I admit I only moved some of the furniture. My laminate wood finish floors are beautiful!Bottom line is that this is a good machine that I recommend to anyone who has to wash floors.",One
Nathaniel Pope,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nifty machine,the United States,27-Mar-20,CrossWave,,Very nice machine. I use it for hardwood and tile in our living area.  Does a good job. Is it perfect?  No but I think it’s as good as you’ll find.  A little streaky on the hardwood but I don’t know it’s the machines fault. Maybe if I experiment with different solutions I’ll get a better result. What really sold me was the mess it cleaned up in our basement.  With the snow melt there was some water seepage in the basement near the cat box area. This created a mud mixture of a mess on the concrete floor.  Enough to make most gag. Traditionally the hardest part of this clean up is separating the clean water from the dirty. This is what the crosswave excels at. Is it a commercial grade machine?  No but it’s plenty good enough. The dirty water storage is a little small but the only loss is the time dumping it out.  I have the regular version. I believe the only differences are a different roller and a hair trap in the dirty water bin. I have 3 different rollers on the way to experiment with.,One
J. Mason,3.0 out of 5 stars,I'll NEVER buy another Bissell Product Again,the United States,28-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"The CrossWave's performance has been a total disappointment.  For starters, the vacuum power is a joke … my $39 stick vac does a better job of getting up stuff.I bought my Crosswave about a year ago; but used it only about a dozen times.  It take so long to disassemble and clean it after use that it's just not worth the hassle.  I just went to use it and not the roller brush isn't turning.  (Yes, I took it apart and made SURE the brush was properly assembled.)This is not the first Bissell product that has been a piece of junk.  As my headline says, I will NEVER buy another Bissell product again.",75
Daniel C. Rohda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,the United States,16-Jul-21,CrossWave,,"This is my favorite household product of the past 5 years. I works so well on our wood floors. I no longer use cleaning solution and just water with a few drops of dish soap. Every time I use it I by the end of the day clean all the parts and leave then to air dry. only takes a couple minutes and is keeping the whole thing fresh and working great. For those complaining that it leaves streaks likely their floors are just really dirty and need more time being cleaned to pull up all the dirt. This is one of the few products that if it randomly broke down the road, I would buy another immediately. My only request for future modules would be to have tanks that hold more water (both clean and dirty).",
Aileen Gilmore,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Partial Review,the United States,19-Jul-18,CrossWave,,"I have been pining to buy this product but was a bit weary of the price.  On Amazon day it afforded itself to me and I eagerly opened the box but was sure to take pictures of how it was packed all the way down in case I needed to return.. and here we go!I am a fairly new transplant from NJ to TX and my usual experience was cleaning large pile, wall to wall carpets and a kitchen floor.  It turns out that most of my home in TX has  beautiful hand scraped hard wood floors and some seriously grooved large tiles in my kitchen and breakfast area.  This means I have a lot of area rugs in my house as well and my old super duper carpet cleaner will not do in TX homes.  I have bought so many mops, steam mops, brushes etc but the task of cleaning floors and now rugs with 3 dogs is a major problem.  Also, my house is where appliances go to die while I always try to find the perfect thing for cleaning or in the kitchen which means I should be a tester/reviewer for anything home product related.  Anyway, my house is pretty large based on Jersey standards but certainly not for TX standards so I am not kidding to say that the coverage for cleaning is massive and having a product that saving my back is helpful.  The following pro's and con's are for hardwood floor cleaning.  Tomorrow I will edit to add the rugs. (I have also purchased the Rug Brush Roll attachment that should arrive tomorrow).Pro's:This product vs mopping is major.  Mopping, regardless of the mop , moves the dirt, dust and dog drool around while trying to achieve shine and cleanliness.  This product dispenses either a solution you insert into the product (warm) or plain warm water and the product also extracts the now dirty water leaving a much cleaner floor behind.Having so many dogs, I usually vacuum first and this product alludes that it vacuums while cleaning.  It did just that. I did not have to collect all the collective wet hair that went airborne or missed and stuff in my pocket while I continue to mop.. for hours.. because my house is too big for me..  What I mean to say that the task to swiftly vacuum one more time was not necessary.While washing floor area's with next to zero dog traffic, I have found significant results.  My living room, dining room and hallways that lead to two wings are completely cordoned off to the dogs.  I started in these areas first which are normally clean and just mostly need dusting and cleaning from TX type bug droppings.  Yeah I know.  If you are not from the south, I cannot explain this to you.  Another disgusting effect from living in the south and wonder what the hell the bugs are eating to leave such remains behind.  They might eat their own young.  Lord I digress.  I was impressed with no streaks and an appearance of a clean floor.  I texted my husband and told him so far so good and he wondered if it was a keeper and I told him that we will wait until rugs are done.  UNTIL... I needed to dump the water .  IT WAS MUD!!  No kidding!! MUD!!  4 years of moving around dust and dog drool before I finally cordoned off the area was not really clean!  I do not care!  I am now throwing away the boxes and keeping this just for floors!I have a bad back.  No real impact at all like using a tall swiffer type mop to swoop the floors.  My back is not a problem hereYou certainly do not have to use their cleaning solution.  I was using Bona as a 1 to 3 solution for hardwood floors.Cons:The electric cord is not long enough.  It is a three pronged type male plug so you must plan how to make this work.It may take longer than using a mop since the water does not flow out easily.  Its careful how it lets out the soapy water.  But again, no mop has a spinning brush and your back will thank you.This product does not go to the edge of the floor to wall.  There is a clear one inch not cleaned.  I decided to take my scrub brush mop and wrap a microfiber rag around it and use Bona in a squirt bottle to tackle the edges and use the brush mop to clean prior to using the Bissell.Ok, its clear I had to have a few gulps of wine to get through this review.  I will come back later and correct any spelling or grammar!On ending this partial review.. buy this Product!",2
seb33776,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job,the United States,5-Sep-21,CrossWave,,"I didn't buy this on Amazon, I got it as a gift (and possibly a hint to clean my floors lol) but I wanted to review it.  I'm really impressed with the results.  I have used it about 5 times now because I wanted to use it a few times before the review.  The first time I used it was was happy with how well it did and a little disgusted with just how dirty my floors were.  I have about 1800 sq feet of tile floor and it takes about two large floor fills to do everything.  I use it about once every couple weeks now and it only takes about 1 1/2 hours to do it all and the results are dramatic.  I have the corded model which is better for me because of the size of the floor.  I It's a great tool for a single father who hates to clean.  The above pictures are from the first time I used it but the water is almost as dirty every time.

A.E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely perfect for vinyl plank flooring!,the United States,13-Sep-20,CrossWave,,I have a chronic pain condition which makes mopping extremely hurtful. My house is 80% vinyl plank (roughly 2000 sq ft) and that's a lot of mopping.  This power mop reduces mopping time from 1/2 day to 40 minutes. Suction power is strong. You may want check for long hairs and pull them out every so often. Hasn't been an issue with clogging or binding up the spinning mop. I use about 1/4 cup white vinegar and fill the rest of reservoir with warm water. No toxic chemicals since I have a dog. I think dog paws on a chemically washed floor is bad for the dog's health. The reservoir holds enough water to wash two medium sized rooms. The dumping tank is light and easy to empty. I don't feel pain after using it. This Bissell Crosswave is a gift sent from heaven!,One
Panteralb,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of Money,the United States,25-Sep-21,CrossWave,,"I was excited to get a tool that would clean both area rugs and hard wood floors since I have pets and kids. The first 3 times I used this on my rugs, it worked pretty well (not great). Then a few days later I tried vacuuming the hardwood....all it did was push the dirt around. Vacuumed my area rugs a few more times, then tried wet cleaning my hardwoods, it didn't do much accept get the floor wet but didn't really clean a wet mess. After leaving it sit for about a week, I turned it on to vacuum my area rugs and it did nothing but make a lot of noise and push the dirt around. I disassembled it and put it all back together (which was a pain in the butt!) and it still was useless. I have spent more time ""fixing"" this tool than using it. If you want to use it just for hardwood floors and don't mind sweeping afterwards, this might be an option but its terrible with rugs!My advice: find something else, this appliance is worse than worthless because you will spend a bunch of time taking it apart, putting it back together and not having it do what it was designed for! Save your money, buy a Dyson, you will save yourself a LOT of headache and your time won't be completely wasted!",One
Cheryl C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Update,the United States,20-Nov-17,CrossWave,,I love this machine!  I thought my floors were fairly clean - NOT!  I was stunned to see the dirty water after I used this.  Operation is very intuitive and the crosswave is light weight and easy to use.  I do not find the after use clean-up of the parts at all onerous or excessively time-consuming.  I have about 2000 ft of tile and some area rugs.  I am not thrilled with the cleaning of the area rugs but it's fine for maintenance vac/cleaning.  It's best to flush the dirty water down the toilet as it picks up a lot of stuff that could clog a sink drain.  My floors are so much cleaner!  I was very happy to see that it picked up all the sand (this is a beach house).My only complaint would be the length of the cord.  I wish it were longer - but it's no shorter than a regular vacuum.EDIT:  motor went out 3wks after warranty ended.  Bearings also went bad on the one I gave my son (2 months after warranty expired).  Bissell refused any assistance.  I will not be buying another one.  I used mine about 10 times before throwing it out.,2
R. Manney,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the clean up jobs that make you want to move out and just find somewhere else to live.,the United States,8-Jan-17,CrossWave,,"In addition to everyday cleaning, this vacuum takes care of all the messes I don't want to.For example: as I stood at the counter in my kitchen pressing out spritz cookies in preparation for Christmas, my four year old son who had grown tired of helping made a trip to the bathroom. I concentrated on pressing each cookie onto the sheet when I heard him shuffle into the bathroom and say ""how did that get in there?"" I glanced his way to see him holding a full roll of toilet paper that was soaking wet with streams of water pouring from it. I immediately panic. ""What..where..is...is that toilet water?! Take it back to the bathroom!"" The urgency in my voice caused him to spin on his heels and retrace his steps in a sprint. His steps, which were now covered in what I can only assume is toilet water. Upon hitting a particularly saturated area, my son's feet slipped out from under him and he landed in a puddle of toilet water with the sopping toilet paper on top of him. I quickly ushered him to the bathtub while questioning how on earth that roll made its way into the toilet. It's still inconclusive. According to him, his two year old sister who was napping somehow escaped her crib, maneuvered down the stairs, snuck into the bathroom, and tossed the toilet paper into the Jon. I have my doubts.Enter, the bissell crosswave. I had just received it the day before, so I grabbed it from the closet and went to work, first using the crosswave to vacuum the water, then spraying the area with bleach and vacuuming again. In minutes, this trail of fecal water was removed, sanitized, and dry.And I won't even tell you about the time my daughter got the stomach bug and showered my dinning room with puke. Let's just say, the crosswave can handle that, too. But you'll want to bleach all the things on it after.Finally, we love in a 100 year old home with brick floors in the kitchen and dining room that are a bear to clean. Sweeping is impossible because of the dilapidated mortar and deep groves. I was skeptical that crosswave would be able to clean the floors adequately but I was pleasantly surprised. The vacuum is strong enough to suck all the dirt and gunk out of the grout areas, and except for the impossibly deep areas where the mortar is missing, the mop function gets in between the bricks nicely. It has saved me hours on my cleaning time. That's a lie. My floors are just clean now instead of me putting off cleaning them for days (weeks?) because of the hours it takes to clean them.2,800 square feet of hard floors and I'm pleased with this vacuum. But you will need to run over the edges with a duet mop or something as every vacuum has its limits on how closely it can get to the walls.",2
L Swanson,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Crosswave is amazing!,the United States,30-Apr-19,CrossWave,,"Oh Crosswave, how do I love thee?I bought this as my own birthday present last year, and it was my favorite piece of equipment until I broke it last week.

It cleans them like a champ with no lingering pee smell.I have sticky dirty kids, too. Anything they've tracked in thus far has come up even if it takes 2-3 passes sometimes.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,A 75% approval rating is very suspicious,the United States,11-Aug-21,CrossWave,,"Let me count the ways it drives me nuts. It doesn't pick up well, floor or rug. After doing ONE rug (this was with an empty, clean inside), I can go over and broom sweep all the little fuzzies it didn't pick up. You can see it blow dirt and fuzzies off the rug to the sides instead of picking them up. If that isn't enough, you have to clean the insides VERY frequently. I have to clean it out before completing my three rugs, one small. Best case scenario, it still isn't a close vacuum clean. I am kicking myself for giving my perfectly good Eureka to a friend and being stuck with this thing. This is a lot of money to throw away.

viceversa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaner for light messes - but machine is LOUD!,the United States,28-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"This vacuum / mop is prefect for my use.  Vacuums all tiny debris and then mops the floor, then vacuums up most of the water.  Perfect!The only issue I have with this vacuum is that it doesn't really scrub the floor to get rid of those old crusty stuck on mess on the tiles.  I still had to grab a scrubber and loosen it up for this vacuum to clean up. But this could be a ""good"" thing as it would put less stress on the hard wood floors?I also find the dirty water tank to be way too small!  Maybe the next gen or someone else will come up with a similar system but with a bigger tank.For my needs, this is a perfect lightweight vacuum / mop.  I wish I didn't waste any of my money on the swiffer and the microfiber spray mop. But I do need the swiffer to clean the bathroom tiles as it smaller and gets through the tight spaces.  No way this thing will fit in there!For heavy duty usage or people with a larger family and really need some cleaning, this vac might be too light duty for you guys. I'd imagine you'll have to empty out the tank 5+ times. Plus, if you use this for 30+ minutes, your ears will start ringing cause it's LOUD.Also, read the manual before use!  I didn't know there was a self-cleaning option.  I did it the hard way by removing the brush and rinsing it out in the sink.  When all I had to do was pour water into the tray. Turn the vac on, let it run for a few seconds and done.update: 3/14/2018This is actually a perfect dry vacuum!  When you just want to vacuum and not use the mop feature, it works great.  Since it has a microfiber brush, it does a better job at picking up dust and ""polishing"" the floor at the same time  better than any other floor vac including the overpriced Dyson.  Dyson answer to this is their ""fluffy"" brush head.  But it's overpriced.----------------------Update: 1/3/2016This doesn't seem to clean very well.  I went across my floor 2 times.  I then grabbed my microfiber mop and went over the area and it was still dirty.I might be using it wrong?  Doesn't seem like a lot of water is coming out when I hit the trigger.",2
Trish,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this does do a very good job, again provided you follow all the above",the United States,14-Jan-18,CrossWave,,"Waivering between a 3 and a 4, not because it doesn't work GREAT-but because you really do have to disassemble the filter, roller etc after EACH wet mop use. Which doesn't seem so much, but what happens is--you take it apart to wash out all the wet parts and you cannot reassemble and use it until the brush is dried. Otherwise you get a very very very moldy odor. My hopeful solution to this major problem, is I am now order two roller heads. So that while one dries--I have the other to put back in-so that I can use it as a dry vaccum on days that I don't also need a mop. This is something that I feel should really be stressed a little more clearly in the directions-having a back up roller can make the difference between really likeing this or being frustrated with it.As far as cleaning, vacumming and area rug cleaning goes.... I think this does do a very good job, again provided you follow all the above. One part that I am still working through is how to use this as just a dry vaccuum. I tried to take the wet tank out, but that seemed to cut the suction considerably. So maybe the answer is to drain the wet tank (but that is risking loosing the expensive solution). Maybe someone else has experience with this to comment?While it does a great job on the open floors and area rugs, it does not cut into the corners or edges very well-which meant I had to get a second mop to get the edges and corners. A trade off I'll accept it the rest of the device works well. I'm on the fence if I would recommend this to someone else based on the difficult upkeep. However, if you are a person who is diligent with maintenace-then this does truly pick up hair, dirt and dust very well.",One
ApplesOverOranges,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the $2500 kirby!,the United States,20-Oct-17,CrossWave,,"We had door salesman come and demonstrate the $2500 Kirby and the Crosswave won! When the Kirby went over the tile floor, there were still spots of food left as this was in the kitchen. After the Kirby salespeople left, I decided to go out and purchase the Crosswave (at the local store) and go over the same spots on the tile that they did. Not only did it pick up the spots that the Kirby missed, the whole dirty water tank was dark brown meaning that it picked up a lot more than that.I also tested the Crosswave on the tile by the back door, after we had a build up of grass and dirt. After a few rolls over the floor, it was spotless. This ended up saving me a TON of time, because before this baby I had to sweep and then wet mop (using a swiffer), and there was dirt still left due to the grout.In all honesty if you are thinking about buying this specifically for carpet, I would probably look elsewhere as I have seen higher rated machines for less money. However, if 3/4 of your floors are solid surfaces (wood, tile, or vinyl), I highly suggest this machine over any other.",3
Cinthya,3.0 out of 5 stars,Read before purchasing one,the United States,13-Oct-21,CrossWave,,"It does an ok job, I used it everyday but it’s not what I expected.I got this thinking that it was going to do a better job than a regular mop and it doesn’t, if you have kids this might not be what you’re looking for.It does a good job picking up yogurt, cereal even gold fish crackers. But once you have deeper stains or food that got stuck on the floor and got dry, it won’t matter how many time you go over and over with the crosswave, you have to scrub yourself.It does the job, but it doesn’t do better than a regular mop.I was about to return it, but it does save a lot of time, and it’s more like for and every day clean.",One
Dianne Spelter,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,the United States,15-May-20,CrossWave,,"(I purchased this from another location so I will not show up as a verified purchaser.)I have 2 children in wheelchairs, and 10 furry pets in a very large house so I was very excited to try this cleaner. At first I was impressed but then reality set in.Pros:Easy to use, easy to mix and fill cleaner solution, easy to emptyCons:Leaves streaks on the floor if you don't clean the roller very often.Although it is easy to empty, it is not convenient to empty because it is a combination of solid (don't want to flush the pet litter or hair down the toilet) and liquid (I don't want to dump it into the trash).Directions tell you to take the bottle of solution off the unit when not in use and that is certainly not convenient.I ran over a piece of cloth, immediately stopped and removed the cloth but the sweeper/vac died, never to start again  after only 4 months of use.This turned out to be an expensive experiment. I'll go back to my broom and swiffer.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic machine,the United States,20-Jun-21,CrossWave,,"I bought the Bissell Crosswave Pet machine a little over a year ago from Bissell.  It has worked wonderfully until it did not work anymore.  I am heartbroken.  I had used it twice in a week, first time it did wonderful, the second time I went to start it and it ran for about a second and quit.  I was devistated because I had just gotten a new puppy and I really needed it for the accidents the pup was having.  I could not do with out it so I went and bought just the regular crosswave and am using it now.  The point is, I spent a lot of money on these machines, cleaned them after every use and this should not have happened.  It is a wonderful machine when it works.  That is why the 5 stars.  But for longevity, I would give it 1 star.",
Randy S. Thomas,1.0 out of 5 stars,This thing will clog easily then no solution spray,the United States,25-Oct-21,CrossWave,,"This machine is good WHEN it works, I used mine 4 times and thoroughly cleaned it after each use.  I only use warm water and white vinegar to clean.  I was happy with it, even touted it to friends ...until my 5th use.  Filled the tank to the level line as usual then...guess what...NO SPRAY... went on to Bissel's site and watched the ""no spray issue"" videos... Tried their fixes but.. this was clogged somewhere internally with NO WAY to get it unclogged.  Sent it back.  Big disappointment with Bissell for such a shoddy design.",
Mamaofthree,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's Okay,the United States,8-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"When I first got this, I would have reviewed at 5 stars. Now that I've used it for a few months, it's not as great as I first thought. I'm a lazy mopper, so I wanted this to make mopping easier and less time consuming. This cleaner has accomplished that. I do now mop probably 10 times more often, and it does make floors look shiny and streak-free. The vacuum is okay. If your sole purpose is to get a vacuum, I wouldn't recommend this. My prior Shark vacuum had much better suction and had a much less annoying cord. This Bissell cord is cumbersome, and unlike other vacuums, if you do run over it, you have to shut off the cleaner and pull it out. Not a huge deal but a slight inconvenience. Here are the reasons I rank this 3 instead of 5 stars:1. The vacuum and mop share the same container for waste. So, unless you dump between switching over to mopping (not less time consuming), you'll have a really gross mess that you won't want to put down your sink, so you'll end up with a watery mess in your garbage.2. If you forget to dump after using, the container will be very stinky and gross the next time you go to use it.3. Every few times using it, you'll have to disassemble and clean. You'll know it's time when nasty water comes out instead of clear cleaning solution + water. The directions state to disassemble and clean each time, but I keep going until I need to because = lazy and I was looking for something that wouldn't take a ton of time to use.4. It takes a good amount of time for the mop to dry out between uses. If you vacuum and mop a room and then decide you just want to run a quick vacuum through another room, that won't work. The other room will be wet and streaky.5. It does put out a good amount of water onto floors. My husband gets freaked out and will follow me around with towels. I think it's fine. But, if you are really sensitive to the amount of water that goes onto your hard floors, this will be too much for you. A steam mop would be better.I only have hard floors in my house, so it doesn't factor into my rating, but if you wanted to use just the vacuum portion on carpet, I would definitely not recommend that due to the mop always being a little damp.Overall, this does make me mop my floors more often and they do look clean when done. If you are someone that doesn't mind separate machines, you can easily find a better vacuum and a better mop separately.",2
Katie Hansen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not a miracle machine",the United States,8-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"My Bissell Crosswave arrived today and I couldn't wait to try it out.  I have mixed feelings about it, so I thought I would give you my experience.It's been 4 days since I last mopped, so my floor was filthy. I have 3 kids(One is a baby) and a dog. We live in the desert so my floor gets sandy and dirty really fast. I usually mop every other day but I've been busy this week, so I put the crosswave to a really good test.The first thing I tested was the crosswave's ability to get right up to the baseboards. I would say that it got about 80% of the food there on the first pass.The second measure I was going for was the ability to pick up hunks of food. There was cheerios, baby puffs, and dog food all over the floor and the crosswave picked them all up with zero problems!  (The floating bits in the picture)The next item on my list was seeing if this thing  could handle dried on food. I had a spot near the garbage where I missed and baby food was splattered all over the floor.  For this I give the crosswave a 6/10 rating. It did pick up most of the stuck on stuff but it usually took 3+ very slow passes. Fourth I wanted to see how long it would take to clean it up, when I was done. This I would give a 10/10. It took less than 5 minutes my first time using it and I was being very meticulous.Fifth, the estimates on the directions are way too low as to how much area you will cover with one tank. I did 300 sq ft and used a tank and a half.Other thoughts... You will need a scrubby to get up any really tough parts. I have to do this anyway when I mop, so I don't see that as a big deal. Also you have to mop REALLY slow. In the video I was going too fast for the mop function. The vacuum feature will pick up stuff but it takes longer for it to scrub the floors really well. I will probably still mop once a week or so, just so I can make sure the baseboards are clean and get under the lip of the stove and fridge.It will take some getting used to as it tips over fairly easily.  One thing that I wish it came with is a better stand because the dirty tank cannot be reassembled until it is dry, which takes up precious counter/storage space. I would also suggest that you buy extra rollers and filters if you plan to use it daily. All together it took me approximately 30-35 minutes to clean my floor from set up to putting the machine away on my first try.Overall for daily use I give it a 9/10 as far as deep cleaning goes I only give it a 7/10.",2
Andi,5.0 out of 5 stars,This...  Is...  Amazing.  $$$ well spent!,the United States,12-Jun-18,CrossWave,,"We live in a medium sized home in the country.  That includes 3 cats,  1 dog,  dirt roads,  tracking dirt in from the gardens and chicken coop.... The list goes on.  We have hardwood floors,  so you can imagine how hard it is to keep clean.  I uses to bissell everyday to get rid of the pet hair, dirt and settled dust. I would then spot mop here and there and it took me about an hour for all the floors,  sweeping and spot mopping.  The after months of begging,  my husband ordered this for me.  O.  M.  G.  The suction power is fabulous!  Ill say it gets 98% of the dirt and pet hair,  but i can also spot mop at the same time.  I just did all my floors AND COUCH AND RUGS in about 25 minutes!  Its expensive, but worth every penny.  The floors always look great.  I still sweep daily because of the pet hair,  but the floors are looking so much better.  The chord is very long,  love it.  I use water and vinegar.  There are a few cons.  The underside of the handle is weak.  So be careful when sweeping under furniture.  It is hard to get very far under the furniture so that sucks,  but still worth buying the product.  It has a stopper on the front to keep water from spraying out,  so if you sweep up to the wall,  it leaves about a quarter of an inch gap (i just take a rag and get it,  not too much of an inconvenience).  After every use you must take it apart to clean it.  The upside...  Its VERY easy to take apart to clean.  Takes me about 3 min,  maybe.  Its nosier than i expected,  maybe not quite as a regular vacuume , but more than a regular bissell.  It was money well spent for a busy teacher/farm girl.  If it ever breaks...  Ill buy another one,  its that great!",

Nathaniel W. Martin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Clogs a lot, cleans a bit, not worth.",the United States,24-Nov-19,CrossWave,,"Bought this and after one use immediately regretted it.  Everytime I use it none of the dirt makes its way up to the tank and instead gets stuck at the suction base after a few bits of hair is hit. This results in me hand cleaning wet muddy hair out of my vac each time I use it.  It DOES suction dirt and pebbles much better than a carpet vac but if you accidentally hit the water portion it gets clogged almost immediately.  The mop portion of it, if I sweep the entire house first, does make the floor feel a bit cleaner.  If there is a bit of grime (say a spaghetti noodle left some sauce on the floor) It might get most of the sauce though I'd say it's better to just rub your sock on it and then vac over that spot.  Overall still looking for a vac that can clean my downstairs without me sweeping and handling a clog.  Can't look too hard at over $200 a try.",One

I recently got  2 wirehaired dachshund puppies to keep me and my 14 year old longhair dachshund company. We live in a high rise apartment building and take multiple daily walks to the park down the street, rain or shine. I have laminate floors which are usually dirty as soon as I've mopped and brought the boys back from a walk. I was desperate for a product that would keep my floors clean with ease--it's too much to vacuum and mop daily with a steam mop. I saw a commercial for the Bissell Crosswave last week and immediately purchases from Target--couldn't wait for it to ship from Amazon, I was that desperate! The first time I used it I felt I was experiencing a miracle--it's that amazing. I didn't think the cleanup of the machine was bad at all (though I was horrified by the contents of the dirty water container), especially when compared to vacuuming & steam mopping the floor seperately. Do not hesitate to purchase this product--it is well worth the money you'll spend on it's purchase--and that is saying something, because it is not exactly cheap at $270.00.

My spouse and I thought well the filters are non-Bissell brand, so let's try that. Well, that was the reason. The Bissell brand filter ensures the fit is just right and that is critical for the suction.I will say the one con I find is I do have pets.

A. RUSS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do not wait to buy this. well worth every cent.,the United States,22-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"for starters, I used to clean houses and have tried or owned many a vacuum, mop, steam cleaner. this one tops the cake. I watched this for a year and researched reviews diligently. finally I purchased it. I wish I hadn't waited so long. this vacuum is a life saver/ changer. I have a 2yo who makes lots of little messes on the floors. Now I just grab the crosswave and clean them up, milk and cereal all over then floor... no problem, it will suck up the milk & cereal & clean the floor with one pass. crumbs in the area rug... no big deal, it just sucks everything up and yes, of course it it shampoos the area rug. no need for using towels to clean up spoiled drinks, etc. I have not tried it on shag or oriental type area rug but it works great on my burba type area rugs. I was actually going to buy new area rugs, however,  using the crosswave had brightened them up enough so I can continue putting off buying new ones. All of the shampooers and steamers I have used require alot of maintenance and upkeep with every use. the crosswave is easy to set up in the morning and use off and on all day until I take it apart and give it a good clean at night which takes about 5 minutes. I'm blown away buy the powerful suction force of this small all-in-one,  better suction than my top of the line carpet shampooer. Better the suction the better the clean.cons:the cleaning solution is expensive at 10$ a large bottle and I'm going through about 5 bottles a month which is alot but I do use it several times a day. If your Floors are heavily soiled and dirty, I have found that this system works best if you clean or scrub your floors first and then maintain the clean with the crosswave.I wish the power cord were a little longer.The cleaner is too pricey.",

There was nothing stuck inside stopping it from spinning at all, nothing caught on the brush. Seriously annoying. My husband asked how expensive it was to decide if he should just try to take it apart and look at it or if we should take it to get repaired. My guess is we will be buying a new vacuum.",
Ann R. Lighter,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disposal of the wet debris & dirty liquid in the pick up tank is a mess.,the United States,2-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"I have a mix of tile, hardwood and area rugs in my home, and was attracted by the idea of having to use only one appliance to both vacuum and wet mop my floors.  It does have a downside though, when it comes to emptying out the gunk in the pick-up tank !  It's a combination of too much liquid to put into the garbage, and too much debris (pet hair) to put down the sink.  I ended up reaching into the tank to pull out most of the icky debris first and then dump the rest of the liquid into the toilet and flush it away.  Then it had to be cleaned out, which was another task in itself.Next time, I tried doing all of the dry vacuuming with it first, emptied out the debris in the garbage, then went over everything again to wet-mop, and emptying the resulting dirty liquid in the toilet.  Still a lot of steps, with the clean up of the unit, rinsing out the filter, etc.  Even though I let it dry out, as directed, I wonder about the amount of bacteria that grows in the tank and interior of the unit, and gets spit back out in the next cleaning process.  At least with my old damp mop system, the pads would be thrown in the washing machine to clean.I should mention that I clean my floors every week.So, I'm not completely thrilled with the time factor of cleaning out the machine and the wet gunky debris to deal with, no matter how I use it.I did find that if I only use it on hard surfaces, it seems to work better, but still a lot of work in the cleaning of the machine each time.I'm not sure if, in the long run, this is a time saver or not.I'm keeping it, as I think it has some advantages if used on hard surface floors, but it is not as wonderful as I had hoped it would be.UPDATE:  I've used it for a couple months and I still think it is a real pain to clean after using.  Imagine everything you vacuum up, mixed with dirty water to make a black hairy sludge.... ACK.  Better have your plumber on speed dial.  Then, having to take it apart and clean the parts, dry everything out... My final opinion is that it is much  more trouble than it's worth. Going back to my vacuum and damp mop system that, in the long run, takes half the time.",
Antoinette C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy this!!!!,the United States,9-Sep-17,CrossWave,,I ordered this vacuum a few weeks ago. I purchased it direct from Bissell because it came with 3 rollers for different floor surfaces and 3 containers of cleaner for $249. I have to say this has cut my cleaning time in half! I thought my floors were clean. I mop once a week and swiffer almost daily. We have 3 dogs and 2 cats so cleaning regularly is a must. The first time I used it I was disgusted! The water in the collection tank was almost black. I really thought my fkoors were clean when I mopped but I was so wrong.,6
Kac52b,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for pet messes!,the United States,9-Apr-18,CrossWave,,"I was looking for something easier to use than a mop and bucket. This fits the bill. However, I feel like you have to go at a very deliberate, slower speed to feel like it’s getting things clean. I tried the hard surface setting on my kitchen linoleum and felt like it didn’t do anything at all. I turned it on the rug setting and it seems to do a better job. I was skeptical with as much pet hair as my house contains that this would clean well enough without my prerequisite sweep, but I was pleasantly surprised. It does a good job! We currently have an elderly dog, a puppy, and a toddler in the house... this thing gets a daily workout.The reason for only 4 stars is the machine cleaning required after every use. It’s kind of a pain to get done ‘mopping’, then have to take apart a machine and clean it too. Because I use the machine daily, I’ve cut back to cleaning off the bristle brush to weekly, but I clean the tanks and filter after each use.",One

But by no means does this solve all of your household problems or save your marriage like advertised.  I have both tile and hardwood floors.  It works ok on the hardwood, and the flat surface of the tiles after a few swipes over them.  But not so much on grout or grooves between tiles, especially if they are relatively deep or uneven.  I had high hopes for this product, but they were dashed after the first use on the tile floor room where I keep my two bulldogs during the day when I'm at work.

Due to my work schedule I’m Barely home and I’m always working, so Sunday is my cleaning day. Well this past month I haven’t been using, so I’ve been using my other Bissell. Anyways, I went ahead and submitted a claim, in a week my replacement came in and let me tell you a HUGE difference, the suction is better, there is no left over water or even a mess behind. It dries the floor and doesn’t leave it soaked. Honestly I am happy with my product.",One
J. Amato,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is Legit!,the United States,28-Nov-16,CrossWave,,"Been using the Powerfresh steam mop for a while.  It works great until the pad gets dirty, then if you don't change the immediately you're wasting time.  I read some of the reviews and decided to give the Crosswave a try. We have 1000 square feet of Brazilin Redwood (dark) along with a dog, and two kids that are active in sports.. The floors take a beating.  I purchased the Crosswave at the department store that's name begins with a K and ends with an S.  I was able to use coupons and got it for $200.  If it didn't meet my needs I was planning on returning it.  After using it I am convinced that this thing is magic!  It really does a great job of vacuuming and mopping at the same time.  The bottle of solution contained in the box is small it barley was enough to complete the full 1000 square feet.  A few tips.Try to go with the grain of the wood.  This will help pull the water out of the grooves of the floor.  Don't use carpet mode on hardwood... it will make the wood floors too wet. Clean brush after each use with warm water.  Wring it out and let it and the filter dry before replacing.A few things I don't like... The cord is short... much shorter than the powerfresh... The solution is not easy to find.. None at Walmart.. or Khols... I did find it at Lowes and ordered it from Amazon.  The unit comes with the multi purpose cleaner.  I just received the hardwood solution.. I like the multi better. Works better on my wood floors. Be careful when you place the unit upright, if it's not completely locked upright it will crash to the ground.  It does not clean edges.. But.. I use the powerfresh for that.  It's a great 1-2 punch!  It's not perfect but it's excellent.  If you want perfection you need to get on your hands and knees and do it by hand.  I'll pass and use this great cleaner!",One
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it but could be better,the United States,4-Sep-17,CrossWave,,"Bissell Crosswave ReviewOverall a great unitLet’s be honest I might be harder on this than I should be because of what I am use to.In GeneralPro1. Quick and easy to use2. Easy to clean3. Dries faster than others.Con1. Need to go over an area multiple times2. Does not dry as well as advertised3. Not as good on carpet as I am use to.Tile floorsTo start with let’s look at how I normally do tile floors.1. Let’s sweep up all the dirt, dust bunnies, paper etc.2. Using a house mop I lay down a heavy layer of water to soak and breakup the crud that has gotten stuck to the floors.3. Now I go over the floors with the same mop in an attempt to get up as much water as I can.4. Next, I use our Swiffer to pick up as much of the water as it will.5. Lastly and this is the hard part I try to keep everyone off the floor until they completely dry.Now comes the Crosswave. I don’t have to sweep. I might need to put down water where things have been spilled but I don’t have to pre-mop the floors. I just Use the Crosswave and go over each area a few times. It doesn’t get the floors totally dry but by the time I finish the first area is dry. Much faster and so much easier.As with anything like this it does not get the corners or along the baseboards but that is to be expected.For tile, I give it a five out of five.Carpet FloorsAgain, how did we do them in the past? We have a very expensive and high end commercial grade vacuum and shampooer.1. Sweep the carpet or pick up any large pieces of trash (My wife’s dog is a shredder if she gets hold of any paper or cardboard she will destroy it.)2. Vacuum the floor this takes several passes and many trips to empty the bagless collector bin.3. Set up the shampooer and go to town. Who needs the gym this thing gives me a workout like no other. Think an hour of cardio workouts with brief stops to dump the dirty water and get fresh water (the shampoo goes in another tank and last for several uses.)4. Now the carpets will be damp for hours but we can at least walk on them if needed.Using the Crosswave I still need to pick up the large stuff but I don’t need to deal with first vacuuming and then Shampooing. However, it doesn’t get as much dirt out as our other units. It also doesn’t leave the carpets as damp nor do I get the workout I was getting.Over all I’m going to give it a four out of five I love the easy of use but wish it got things a little cleaner. We will keep our old units for when we want to do a deep cleaning and use the Crosswave for normal use.",
Kim Abraham,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,10-Dec-19,CrossWave,,"I have had this product for two years. Today was the first time I took it out of the box. It was very easy to set up and use. I loved how simple it was and how it helps clean the floor like I was mopping. I would like to buy one for my mom and oldest daughter for their floors. I dislike emptying it but use my utility tub. Slowly pour out the dirty water and use paper towel to clean up the hairs and dirt pile or dump in trash. Can't believe how much dirt came up! I do recommend vacuum normally for very dirty floors first as needed. Otherwise using this item or similar would work great. Thank you Bissell! Cleaning up after our puppy and the dirty paw prints from rain and snow when they come in, has made it so much easier and just cleaning the floor makes my kitchen look so much cleaner.",
Dee,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well for a minute...,the United States,11-Jun-21,CrossWave,,"Worked well until it didn't work at all a little under a year after purchase.I purchased it for the convenience of quick cleaning vs a mop and bucket... And for that it was great. Another reviewer wrote of bad design where some part was susceptible to moisture and burnout which is what I gathered happened with mine. Now I'm back in the market and looks like this is still the only game in town.Essentially, I consider it a $270 gamble...Two stars because it works great, but no idea for how long... And less than a year is just not acceptable.",
Sarah,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money and time,the United States,21-Jan-18,CrossWave,,"First off, I begged my husband for the cross wave for months and now that i have it, i have to pretend i love it.I have a chocolate lab that sheds a ton.  I vacuum regularly.  I clean my vacuums after every use.  I even swap out vacuum brushes on the bissell, depending if I’m doing a dry vac or a wet vac.I swap between the bissell cross wave and the Dyson cordless animal friendly vacuum.  I prefer the dyson any day!  This vacuum clogs easily and frequently!  I just vacuumed my area rug and had to turn the vacuum off 3 times to clear the clog in the line.  It appears to clog right before the dirt/hair would enter the dirt tank.  And when i do decide to use the water portion, it hardly sucks back up any water.I’ve attached the picture of what my rug looks like AFTER i vacuum!  Clumps of dog hair everywhere.So frustrated with this vacuum!I do not recommend unless you prefer to clears clogs and waste time.",One
RiaRain,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't think...just BUY!,the United States,19-Oct-17,CrossWave,,"This thing is amazing!  I was a little nervous about buying it because my symphony (which I LOVED) stopped putting out steam after only 6 months.  I thought it did a good job at cleaning the floors but even though I would use it everyday, my kids would still have dirt on their feet.  It would boggle my mind.  I literally would steam mop every single day.  But I was forced to get something else when It died and due to back problems, an all-in-one is a must have for me.  I have a home daycare and mopping + sweeping everyday is just too much on my back.  THIS THING HERE is amazing!  I couldn't believe all the dirt that was in that cup....especially since I mop every single day.  So I decided to do a white cloth test (baby wipe) and I went over a few area and there was literally NO dirt on that baby wipe!  Some people were complaining about the clean up afterwards but its really not that big of a deal...pull the cup out, flush the dirt and then rinse the cup and filter and put the cup back.  You can self-clean the brush in 15 seconds too and that beats washing  and keeping up with all those stupid pads all the time!  I am going to register my product right away this time because if I have any issues, I will be contacting bissell.  They truly have amazing products.  I can't wait till the morning when everyone leaves out so I can clean my entrance way mat.  Bottom line- Cleans amazingly, strong suction (picked up dog food and cereal too), not obnoxiously loud, easy to clean, lightweight, swivel was a plus.",
Jennifer L. Rau,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome all-in-one machine...,the United States,7-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"I thought my house was clean before this machine.  Boy, was I wrong.  I've been eyeing this machine for a while.  My entire downstairs is hardwood and tile, so getting all of that clean uses about three different setups - vacuum everything, Bona mop and solution for hardwoods, and bleach solution for the tile floors with a string mop.  In multi-surface mode, this device went seamlessly from my tile to my hardwood floors without missing a beat.  I did all of my tile and a large majority of my hardwood floors on one tank.  The dirty water was BLACK - I am thoroughly grossed out.  I have been cleaning with solutions and white vinegar for years thinking it was the greatest thing ever - apparently not.  I will be using this machine primarily for the hard floor feature, but am anxious to try it out on some high traffic areas of my carpeting upstairs.As for hardwoods - make sure you pass over the area without using solution to pick up any stray areas where water may have collected.  Natural hardwood has a lot of indentations and imperfections, so that will make sure that as much moisture is removed from your hardwood.  I could immediately feel the difference on my floors when I walked over them.  I was a bit apprehensive about spending this amount of money, but so far, I am impressed and my house is much cleaner.  I have young kids and dogs, so keeping the floors clean is hard work, but this will definitely help me keep a clean house.I've seen some reviewers that were not happy with the clean-up afterwards, and that is understandable.  I found it to be pretty quick and easy.  Pull the dirty water tank and dump the water down the toilet, empty hard particles in trash and rinse out.  Pull the filter and rinse both the lid and filter - leave out to dry.  Pull brush roll and rinse - set in drying rack - that's it.  Pretty much just remove all the parts that hold water, rinse and let air dry.  I plan to use this machine for my deep cleaning weeks, not for touch ups here and there, so waiting for it to dry isn't much of a big deal for me.I think it's a great tool for someone like me who doesn't have a lot of extra time between my job and taking care of the kids and needs to get the floors cleaned quickly.EDIT:  I used it on a high traffic carpet area upstairs - OMG!!  Apparently, I need a new vacuum too.  There was literal sludge in the dirty water tank for all the additional dirt this machine picked up.  I only used it on a couple of really difficult spots and once dry it had removed the entire stain with ease.  The stain was set in too.  Carpet was damp, but not soaked, and was completely dry within a half hour or so.  I also cleaned my bathrooms and kitchen again and the water was not even close to being as dirty as it was on the first wash - thank goodness.  My hardwoods look amazing and my socks are no longer dirty on the bottom.  This machine is LIFE!!  I really hope it continues on this trajectory, because I love this machine.  I really wish I could get it all the way to the base boards, but I just go around with a wet cloth and some of the cleanser and wipe up about an inch from the wall. It is expensive, but if I never have to buy another microfiber mop again - it will pay for itself in a year or two.  It's well worth the money to me.",2
anna lavender,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good if you have a lot of non carpeted area, but huge pain when it comes to cleaning it.",the United States,16-Feb-21,CrossWave,,"We recently bought our home, which is like 90% tile, everywhere except the bedrooms. So I thought this would be perfect, and it would be, minus a few things. The biggest issue to me is when it comes to cleaning it. It’s an annoyance to me. Not convenient at all.It also sometimes leaves dirty streaks on the floor as well, and doesn’t get corners, or close to the edges well. If just using the vacuum, it works great! The suction is AWESOME, and works wonders for a house with three long haired girls. It won’t pick up certain things though, so I have to use an actual broom before hand. I wanted to love it, and I do for the most part, but sometimes it seems like more work than it’s worth.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing!,the United States,1-Oct-17,CrossWave,,"I absolutely love this machine! I spent an ungodly amount of time on my hands and knees scrubbing floors on my first floor on Friday. On saturday, I found this on a decent sale, so decided to splurge on one. I got home that night and used it on the same area I had cleaned *thoroughly* the day before, and the water still came up looking almost black! I am most definitely impressed by the deep clean this machine provides, and highly recommend it! It is also very easy to use and the floor dried fairly quickly. I am also pleased that the included formula is labeled pet and family safe, as I have a puppy who likes to help me clean the floor. If you're on the fence about the crosswave like I was, it is definitely worth the money.",4
Josh Nelson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Astonished,the United States,19-Dec-19,CrossWave,,"With about 5 months of continuous use, I can say that I can submit an honest review on this product. I caught this on a great sale and decided to bite the bullet and purchase this. This thing has taken all of the abuse I could possibly throw at it. There were some lessons to learn along the way, but once you know it's limits, it is a life saver in the household.ATTENTION ALL PET OWNERS:This is the product for you. Don't waste the extra money on the pet pro model. This one performs just as well. I have 3 animals, one being a poodle pup who frequently has diarrhea. Though some may not recommend using this product for that type of cleaning, i have had no issues. I would highly recommend deep cleaning everything afterward due to a terrible smell while running the machine if you don't. The only issue i had regarding pets is when wet vaccuming, i have to make a few extra passes to pick up the hair from my short hair pet.CLEANING:As mentioned above, any gross or nasty clean up, I would recommend cleaning immediately after use. You could get away with not cleaning it if it is something simple. Based on how much I use it, I typically soak everything in bleach, and rotate out the brushes.CLEANING SOLUTION:I have heard of others making their own cleaning solutions to cut costs down, or be more effective. I went a different route and tried all the commercial products, and the best one ive found that works is the bissel brand with the febreeze. It always leaves the best smell behind, and brings freshness back into the room.Overall this product has been worth every penny and when it finally dies, I will definitely be in the market for another one!",One
Melissa Newburn,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great day to day- not for deep cleaning,the United States,3-Oct-21,CrossWave + Formula + Brush Roll,,"Super strong vacuum - cut cleaning in half and great day to day with new messes. Super strong it sucked up a pencil, crayon, wet paper.Negatives all have to do with the mopping function- left tire streaks, does not get stuck on messes at all even after doing 10 Passovers, it should not advertise as a carpet cleaner it did absolutely nothing to clean those, left puddles but think that is user error.",
Sideshow,3.0 out of 5 stars,I expected more,the United States,19-Nov-18,CrossWave,,"I have chronic pain so i was thrilled when I received this as a gift at Christmas 2017. I loved it at first because the thought of the extra help of cleaning up after a family of five was fabulous... but then I quickly noticed that I am having to do just as much work when cleaning my floors as I did before I got this.  I have to pre treat the floors and then go over the floor the first time with the crosswave. THEN I have to go back to ALL the spots that it didnt clean.  It doesnt scrub whatsoever. I do have two puppies so this is perfect for those little piddles they make and cleaning up the hair without having to vaccum first. However that is about it. I also noticed that after owning this for about a year these problems have surfaced. Only half of my roller cleans the floor. I was able to put it in the flat container and clean the brush but now it seems that it barely touches the floor so I am assuming I have to replace the brush. ALSO, After it has been sitting for more then a couple hours it not only LEAKS but it also spits when it is first turned on. I mean no big deal because I am going to clean the floor either way but i feel like theres some major maintenance issues that arise after having this for a year. Its great at the beginning but once it gets broken in, you will absolutely tell the difference.",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for everyday and dog fur, but that’s pretty much it.",the United States,13-Mar-18,CrossWave,,"This is a decently priced vacuum that I’ve had for about a year now. The biggest issues (at least for mine) are 1. I have to take the fluid out every night or I wake up with a puddle of cleaner on my wood floors, and 2. If you don’t clean it often and well then the small hole it pulls everything up with will become clogged and rather smelly. The suction is okay. If you’re looking for something that will pick up everything on the floor, you are severely mistaken. The roller was hard to clean so I only use it as a vacuum now, and the extent of what it picks up is as follows: dog fur, bird seed, small pieces of dirt and dust. I own a Siberian husky and I have to vacuum twice a day every day, but dang this vacuum eats it up! It makes it super easy to vacuum the clumps of fur laying all over the house, along with all the single pieces laying around, without blowing much of it into the air. Another big thing I like about it, is that it’s super great at collecting the dog fur without clogging up and none of it gets past the filters! I’ve already broken a small shop vacuum and 2 handhelds that couldn’t deal with all the fur, but this works great for it!Overall, not the best suction and can only pick up small items, but it’s great for dog fur and everyday use; just don’t expect it to pick up anything bigger than seeds.(If you notice you’re losing suction, check in this hole pictures . It’s pretty small so it can get backed up if you don’t regularly clean the vacuum.)",3
MikeTee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,27-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"I got this during the Black Friday sales of last year.  I was previously using a steam mop, but I didn't like how I would just push wads of hair and dust bunnies around.  I got this, hoping that I would have to do less spot-cleaning by hand.  My house is about 1500 square feet with zero carpet (just wood floors and tile floors).  When I bust out the CrossWave, my cats have a heart attack and flee from it.  I don't even bother doing a pre-cleaning with a Swiffer or anything anymore, I just load it up with hot water and the Bissell solution (I'm probably going to start experimenting with using other solutions like Vinegar just because of the price tag of the solution).  This thing does it all.  It leaves the wood and tile floors noticeably cleaner, and feeling great on the bare feet!  So far, I've tested it on: spilled flour on the kitchen floor, dried cat puke (they love to puke under our bed), and dusty dusty-bunny and cat-hair-laden floors.  I do no prep and it picks up all of the messes.  I love that I get to see the dirty nasty water when I pour it out.  I like knowing that I'm not walking on that anymore.I wish the storage of the product was a little better post-use.  For instance, the give you a tray to put it on that lets the rollers sit in to dry, but there's no place to put the filter while it is drying.",One

My sister, Becky, and hairdresser, Joan, told me about this wonderful machine and finally I bought one with the idea that if it didn't work out I would return it! It is the new LOVE OF MY LIFE!!!!! I have never had so much fun cleaning my floors! This works incredibly! You don't even need to sweep or vacuum your floors before washing them (even though I DID vacuum them first!). I cleaned my bathroom floor, the entryway floor, the kitchen floor and the dining room floor yesterday and thoroughly loved it! It was so easy and the result was nice, clean floors! The instructions said that I can also use it on area rugs but I didn't try that one! I used it on hardwood, vinyl, tile, and slate flooring and it worked beautifully! I am so glad I bought this product--thanks to Becky and Joan! :) And if ever you need a spokesperson, I am your gal--I will tell everyone I know to buy this great product! It has made my life so much easier! I also truly appreciated the simple instructions! Thank you Bissell!",
DL,5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved the cleaner though but once I read that the ...,the United States,15-Apr-17,CrossWave,,"I have a Hoover Floormate, (the older version that still had the vacuum feature) and one side had stopped dispensing water. I loved the cleaner though but once I read that the Crosswave also did area rugs I decided I would give it a try. There is a huge difference! I never thought the Floormate was hard to push but after using the Crosswave it's like night and day! The Crosswave just glided across the floor. I had to keep reminding myself to go slower, I wanted to give the spinner some time to work. It pushes easier than my vacuum! I love that the handle swivels. It's great for going quickly around the table legs. Our whole house is linoleum and we have an area rug plus a runner in front of our main entrance. It got the little stains out of the runner. It didn't leave it too wet either. Same with the area rug. It worked great on the rest of the floor. I can't really tell if it did an actual better job them the Floormate or not because I think it also did a great job. The noise when turned on though...the Crosswave is SO much quieter then the Floormate. The Floormate is about as loud as a full carpet cleaner and the Crosswave is more at the level of a vacuum. It's a big difference. We currently live in a duplex so we have a shared wall with the neighbors and have a very good sound barrier but I was always worried about the Floormate being too loud, especially when the husband worked nights. I would try to limit the floor cleaning to the weekends. I won't be having that problem with the Crosswave. I also like that the Crosswave is much easier to clean using the storage tray. The storage tray also has a holder to set the roller in to dry. It also didn't leave that little puddle of dirty water on the floor after it is turned off like the Floormate. On the Floormate there is a dial you had to turn from clean to dry to suck up more water off the floor. Don't have to do that on the Crosswave, just pull or release the water trigger. Overall while I was happy with my Floormate, having now used the Crosswave I would recommend the Crosswave first.",
Bill M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smell fixed!,the United States,4-Oct-17,CrossWave,,"I used the machine the first time but didn't realize I had to empty all the tanks after every use. A few days later I started smelling a horrible mildew smell in the room I store it in and traced it back to the crosswave. I washed all the parts in the dishwasher, but after using it again the mildew smell was still present and now permeates the whole house.Bissell support is worse than useless. They don't care at all and have no useful advice as to how to keep the machine from stinking. The only thing they told me was ""make sure no water goes above the full line on the dirty water tank"". I didn't get it that full and it still stank.If you have to completely take it apart and wash it after every use, the ""mop n go"" aspect of the machine is moot. I really wanted to like this machine but it is an expensive lemon.Update: OK so I somehow lost the cleaning tray seems to be the problem. After every use you fill the cleaning tray with clean water and run the machine for a few seconds. This sucks the cleaning water up into the dirty water tank and cleans the machine. Somehow I lost this tray on unboxing the unit.My second contact with Bissell support (here) was much more fruitful than my first contact via chat. I then called and they sent out the cleaning tray at no charge. It's all working good at this point.",
JT,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning machine!,the United States,18-Feb-17,CrossWave,,We bought this mostly to help clean our wood floor which throughout our kitchen. We have young children that always get food on the floor and the standard vacuum just will not pick everything up. The crosswave does a good job at cleaning up after them. Almost everything comes up with the recommend forward and backward pass with solution on and a follow up dry (vacuum) only pass. There are however a few occasional spots that will not come up where there is some dried up sticky food residue. I will usually just scrub these quickly with a napkin to loosen them up. This probably would not be an issue if we used the Crosswave more often; we use it about once a month.Overall I am pleased with its cleaning ability. The water that is sucked up looks disgusting. Also when we use the Bissell branded wood floor cleaning solution and there are no spots or streaking. (I have tried using Bona solution which we had left over. It does not work quite as well and leaves steaks and shows footprints).The main negative of the machine is that it takes a while to use. The old bona spray and mop we used before was quicker but did not provide near the level of clean that the crosswave does. The other negative is the power chord is not very long. I have to unplug and replug the machine in multiple times.Cleanup after use is pretty easy. Put some clean water into the provided basin/holder and suck it up with the roller on to clean the brush and rinse out the collection basin and filter.Overall we are pleased with this machine as it provides a thorough clean that we just were not able to do before.,One
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,On my 2nd Pet Pro - a waste of $,the United States,15-Nov-20,CrossWave,,"long story short...have 3 small dogs, house is completely tiled...needed something to wash floors instead of mopping and sloshing dirty water around.  So came across Hoover Floormate models which w/alot of hard use lasted a couple of years each, then motors would burn out.  Saw the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro and decided to give this a try, cost vs Hoover Floormates was considerably more but went for it.  1st Pet Pro started out fine, but in about 6 months was not sucking up water, left filthy streaks and was actually doing the reverse, putting out dirty water.  Bissell customer service couldn't help, told me to take it to an authorized repair place which I did.  Machine was totally replaced.  Now approx 6 months later with 2nd machine, same issues starting.  I will ask for a replacement again, & when I do buy another, I will go back to Hoover Floormates.  Very disappointed with this Bissell product - definitely not worth the almost $300 price tag!",One
Shelby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Floors haven't been this clean since we moved in!,the United States,2-Jul-17,CrossWave,,"As a work at home mom to a 2 year old boy and 2 dogs, the roughly 1200 sq ft of hardwood floor on the first level of our home has pretty much looked sad and dingy for at least the last year and a half. I sweep throughout the day and try to use the Swiffer every night, but the Swiffer always made my floor look foggy and found surprise dog hairs and mushed them up into wet balls and deposited them randomly around my floor. Basically, no matter how much I tried, it always looked bad. It was a huge source of shame for me, I'd take a cute picture of my son and our dogs and see how disgusting the floor looked in the lighting, I'd rearrange furniture when people were coming over the hide spots that weren't cleaned well with the stupid Swiffer...it was just really bad. I saw a friend post about her CrossWave so I finally bought it for myself as a birthday gift.The floor had caked on milk droplets, yogurt spills, smushed watermelon/blueberries/strawberries, cake crumbs, dog hair galore, mud, dust, you name it... it was probably at the peak of it's nastiness today when I brought this baby home. Because my floor was so disgusting, I had to go over the more disgusting spots several times and found it worked best to come at it at different angles too. Was this super fast? No. Did it clean every single spot? I'd say 98%, there were very few random spots that required a little hand scrubbing but that was super easy after going over it with the CrossWave. I believe that if I used this daily or at least every other day, it will take care of everything. For being used on floors that have been disgustingly treated over the last 2 weeks with my son's birthday and mine all together which led to extra traffic/more stuff thrown around/less motivation to clean up immediately, I'd say it was amazing. My floors probably haven't been this clean since we moved in. I no longer will feel embarrassed by my floors and won't cringe when I see my kid drop a piece of food on the floor and immediately pop it back in his mouth, since that's just inevitable. I'd 100% recommend this to parents, pet owners, and just about anyone with lots of hard surface flooring in their homes.",
William,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, it's cleaning with CLEAN brushes not a wet, dirty pad or mop.",the United States,8-Feb-17,CrossWave,,"Breaking the rules here, didn't buy mine from Amazon, I needed (wanted) it the day I saw it.  I'm pretty much out of carpet in my house thanks to 3 cats and 3 dogs and what they do to it.  They're not that much better with flooring though the less carpet we have the more they go outside which they have 24 hour access to through doggie doors.  I also have grandchildren that are 8 and 4.  I get messes and I just knew the mop and bucket was really just leaving an even coat of what I was trying to clean up.Well not anymore.The CrossWave is light enough my wife can carry it all over the house.  The water/solution tank is easy to fill and hasn't started leaking yet However it uses a lid design similar to their spotbots which means it probably will start to leak sooner or later.  No problem, just buy a new lid and it's fixed for an equal period of time.  To make it easier, store it with the bottle removed, mine never gets the chance.  It comes with a multi purpose brush.  If you have just hard surfaces buy a second hard surface brush.  It's just microfiber all around.  If you buy a rug only brush you get the red, inner brush part only.  The multi surface is these two parts of the brush together.  It cleans the tops of the rugs just fine, I was usually pulling more fluid off of rugs when I use a wet vaccum on it so I haven't used it on my main carpet, I have a big steam cleaner for that, also a Bissell.The unit is easy to use.  Fill the water/solution bottle as directed with their mix which smells fine though I'd like some variety eventually.  Plug the bottle in, put a brush in and shut the lid.  Plug the unit in and turn it on either hard surface or carpet.  The vacuum will come on and you will need to press the solution trigger for 5 seconds till you see fluid going to the brush.  Then slowly go forward and back over your spill or the floor if you want to mop the whole thing.  Using the hard floor setting just means it will pump fluid out much slower then the carpet setting.  If you have any dried stains, put it on the carpet setting to get more fluid out on the floor, let it sit for a couple seconds and then start working it over.  You could pre-treat the area with a squirt bottle.  Wet floors can be attacked directly.  Go back and forth with trigger pulled and then not till your floor is clean, it won't take long.  It's much better then mopping and wringing.  You're getting the floor much cleaner with far less water.When done, put the unit back in the storage/cleaning stand with it turned off.  Dump and return the waste water container and fill the tray close to the indicated mark on the tray with clean water.  I like to get a cup or two of water and have it on the ready.  Lean the handle back so that the brushes will come on and turn the unit on.  It will spin the brushes in the clean water and suck up the dirt.  I then pour more clean water in and clean further while it's running.  Put the handle up to storage position and turn the unit off.  Pull the brush out, it is VERY convenient, and store it in the stand to dry, dump and clean the waste chamber and return it to the unit.  Mine stays plugged in in the area of most traffic in my house.  Luckily, when your pets see that YOU are winning the war, they start going outside more.  Oh, they stay sneaky and lazy, especially the little dogs, but I more then keep up with them.As for the old carpet, I've pulled the last bit in the common areas of my house to replace with flooring.  This left a bunch of dusty, dirty concrete downstairs.  I swept up the nails, concrete chips and scraps then hit the bare concrete with the CrossWave.  Now that concrete is clean according to my white socks.  I'll be covering it over the next few days but te CrossWave is a handy tool.  I also use it in and around the litter box.  You can never sweap all the litter up.  This does a fantastic job of the left over though.  There are videos by Bissell and several reviewers on Youtube, I highly recommend looking them over.Negatives?  It doesn't go completely to the edge of the unit, so there is about a half inch from wall that needs attention by hand.  That's a bummer for an otherwise flawless unit.  My animals have not figured that out yet and tend to make their messes out in the middle, dummies.  Easy Pickens.I love this machine.  You can catch the edges of your floors with one of those spray and wipe pad brooms after you hit the rest of it with the CrossWave.  You'll be done and your floors dry and CLEAN for once, in no time.  I mean really.  Did you think you could do your house with a filthy wet pad and have it come clean?  And traditional mopping really is a diffusion method of gathering a bunch of dirt in water till the water is so dirty you don't want to spread it anymore.  This sprays cleaning fluid and water OR just water onto the brush, is gathered and scrubbed with by the brush and then the brush is sucked clean while you use it.  Buddy that's cleaning with clean NOT dirty.  You're gonna love it.",
Parker,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE!,the United States,8-May-21,CrossWave,,"10/10! I couldn’t be happier with my Bissell CrossWave! I have a 110 pound boxer that requires me to use it literally everyday because of all the hair in our house, and it 100% works.  My favorite feature is the east clean storage tray! I use it frequently while I use my Bissell CrossWave to clean the brush periodically so I’m not using a dirty brush the whole time. My only complaint is how gross the tank is to clean out but that only means our nasty floor is now very clean! **I suggest legitimately cleaning out the tank after every use or it’ll smell terrible quickly!**",One
Morgangirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, just wonderful. I love it!",the United States,21-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"I recently purchased this, although not through Amazon. Admittedly I found a slightly better deal, which is rare. I love Amazon. If you are like me, Amazon is the first place I look when I want customer feedback on products and almost always to make my purchases...I LOVE THIS little machine!Cleaning the floors are a chore. Ugggh!! But this Bissell is the game changer. I actually enjoy cleaning my floors and do it far more often now. This little beauty does it all. Well, practically...It is so easy and efficient and I couldn't be more thrilled. Instead of dragging out the broom and dust pan which is stunning to see the dust that flies into the air when the light is shining just right; clearly a vacuum is the better choice, and then dragging out the mop and bucket. After cleaning the debris with the vacuum or broom now it's time to fill the bucket, lug that thing around without sloshing the water out. Rinse, rinse, rinse with the mop and wring it out. Mop, mop, mop and back to the bucket to rinse, rinse, rinse and wring out. Over and over with this process. The water gets dirtier, which begs the question, ""how clean is my floor really?"" Lugging the bucket around hoping I won't bang it into my leg. BUT...now the Crosswave.This crosswave vacuums AND mops. The water stays clean and dispenses the correct amount. The dirty is sucked into a container that is easy to remove and empty. Wow, at how dirty your floors can get... My floor dries quickly and looks beautiful. The bonus to this is I can also clean my area rugs. Fabulous! I get this job done in a fraction of the time and so much easier. This little beauty is compact for storage. Nothing heavy or difficult. I love this machine.Just an FYI, I recently purchased the Shark Duoclean, the best vacuum cleaner I've ever owned, hands down. Between these two machines, well, it's all I need. I'm a happy camper.",
Robin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price and not very well made - possibly has electrical issues,the United States,17-Jul-17,CrossWave,,I do not recommend buying the Bissel Crosswave as I have one and it does a piss poor job cleaning. It's good as a luxury shop vac and that is all. I use it for a final rinse of the floors but my unit which is less than a year old has a short in it which I only noticed because it started setting off my GFI in my bathroom. Then my husband heard an electrical crackle when I had it plugged into another outlet. I called to get it replaced through the warranty and instead they want me to ship it out to them to assess it. Going to have to go find a large box and take it apart and then be without it for over 3 weeks. Not worth the hassle or money. A wet/dry vac would work better and be cheaper and less issues as you can buy one local and get it replaced local if it has an issue. I asked them why it couldn't be taken to an authorized repair and they told me this problem cannot be treated at an authorized repair. ?????Just really disappointed in this product. It  has its up side which is it is simple and easy to clean but the job it does isn't worth the price.,One
ReneeT,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was very whelmed.,the United States,6-May-18,CrossWave,,"I was very eager to buy this vacuum after I had previously owned the Bissell symphony and had to return it because it broke. At first, I really liked the crosswave but over time my feelings have changed. I like the swivel and the ease of movement and it does get filled up with a lot of dirty water. The vacuum isn't the best, in fact instead of throwing out our old one we have kept it when we need a more thorough clean or a hose attachment. The most annoying thing for me though is having to clean everything out after every use. This probably isn't as bad for most people but we have a long haired dog and having to dump dirty, hairy water is kind of gross. I also end up needing to clean the inside of the vacuum to get all the wet dirt and hair out.This may be a great vacuum if you don't have pets but I wouldn't buy it again.",One
Minez,1.0 out of 5 stars,Knats,the United States,6-Nov-20,CrossWave,,"Not worth the $, after the first time I used it ,I wanted to return it but I gave it a chance. Used it once, Hated cleaning out the yucky muddy hairy dirty tank . The second time I tried to use it hardly any liquid was being pulled up ,so I gave up on it & didn't clean the tank out because I figured it was okay cause no moisture was being sucked up like it's suppose to. A month later I decided to give it a try and still no suction so I took the dirty tank out & OMG!!! KNATs. KNATs . KNATs. They were living inside the inner hoseing and housing of the crosswave . I poured bleach all over it . Yuck ! Now I am afraid to use it. Waste of money.",
tabitha rich,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY! they will not take returns after 30 days even if website states different,the United States,13-Oct-20,CrossWave,,"DO NOT BUY IT !!!!! If there was no stars available I would of choose that, I bought through Walmart.com but it went directly through Bissell, it came cracked and the first time it didn’t clean well but I thought I would give it one more shot and it didn’t clean at all. I went over the area with a wet paper-towel after and it was all brown so I had to re mop the old school way. I contacted Walmart to return because I was not aware that the purchase went through another seller, they told me that I needed to go through Bissell directly, I did and I was told that because it was passed the 30 days they would NOT give me a refund!! But on their website they state that you have 60 days, they only insure that their product which has many models, up too over $300 works for 30 days. They said oh I’m sorry its been over the 30 days. Customer service HORRIBLE and the product is trash, you are better off mopping the old way. I will be writing reviews everywhere and anywhere. Please save your money and if you want a product rather is like it but actually cleans, there are more out there.",
KEH,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good machine, but only buy new",the United States,25-Jul-21,CrossWave,,"Bought refurbished from Amazon warehouse. It vacuumed pretty well and even scrubbed the floors pretty well with the cleaner. However, it did not suction the water into the tank. It had enough suction to keep the little bit of liquid circulating around the scrubby roller, but when you turned the machine off it dumped all of that dirty liquid back onto the floor. It was unpacked, ran, re-packed, and dropped off for return all the same day.I did end up buying a new one from Walmart a couple days later. It works fabulously. It sucks up all the dog and cat fur without issue and is able to get all muddy dog prints and sticky kitchen spots up in a couple passes. Much easier to use than a traditional mop since I have a bad back, and I don't have to tote around a mop bucket. It doesn't clean the grout very well since the scrubby roller won't reach very deep into crevices.I would recommend the crosswave, just buy new.",
Heather A,2.0 out of 5 stars,UGH!!!!,the United States,25-Nov-19,CrossWave,,Worked great when I first bought it! Did leave streaks though. It also gets really nasty underneath so you have to clean it out immediately and let the pieces air dry before returning them back to their location on the machine. I ran over the cord one time and it literally ate it. I had to try to repair it with electrical tape. I now currently will turn on for about 3 seconds and then shuts off. I have clue what the issue is. I guess i'll just toss it. I hate that because it was almost $300 when I purchased it.,2
Yolanda T. Parks,5.0 out of 5 stars,but can't waste it). Previously used a steam cleaner and I ...,the United States,25-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"CONS:  doesn't get the edges ... about 1/4 inch & no furniture attachmentsPROS:  OMG!  Vacuum & wash my stone tiled (2400 sq ft) house in the same motion, dog hair, kibble & just about everything else swoosh into the tank. I don't have any carpets.  I read a comment that the cord was too short.... don't know how long she wanted it, but the cord is about 15ft long.  It's not necessary to use Bissell liquid, but it is low suds.  I used HOT tap water & my normal cleaner liquid (too sudsy, but can't waste it).  Previously used a steam cleaner and I was amazed at how much sterilized dirt was left behind.CHANGES I WOULD MAKE:  I would like a roller with just the stiff brushes that are on the regular machine roller.  Also, a pre-filter that stops the hair and larger bits & pieces from getting into the tank.  If you add too much, it will lose it's maneuverability.  To be able to do the edges at the same time.  I have had a lot of floor cleaners in my day and this one is GREAT for the price.  Believe me, unless you own a Rainbow with all the bells & whistles there isn't a machine that does it all.  Housecleaning still requires Elbow Grease.  LOL",
Tracy,4.0 out of 5 stars,30 year old hardwood floors,the United States,21-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"After reading reviews and being dazzled by this machines potential - I pulled the proverbial trigger.  So happy I did!  For those of you who have old wood floors, I can attest that this machine and it's wood floor cleaning solution is safe and effective.  In fact, after trying Bono in the machine and comparing it to the Bissell wood floor solution - the Bissell solution actually worked better for my old and tired wood floors.  The floors are cleaner, smell better and the Bissell solution picked up more dirt than when I used the undiluted Bono solution in the same vacuum.  As my wood floors are over 30 years old, Bono made them dry and dull.  Bissell made them bright and clean.  The solution is a bit expensive, but worth it.I have area rugs also and this thing sucked up dirt I didn't even realize was in them.  I've used this machine about 4 times now, on ceramic tile, glued tile, linoleum, area rugs and hardwood floors.  It has cleaned all of them - and that bucket - full of grim, dirt particles, embedded pet hair, and loose fibers.  I am in love with this Vacuum.There are a few flaws; as with any machine.  As others have said, it has a good amount of space between the cleaning brush and the sides.  However, you can pivot your vacuum head to where the front is against the molding - which works just fine albeit a little time consuming.  It does have good mobility for this though.  Another flaw is dumping what you've picked up.  I do not have a utility sink so it is a bit problematic.  I usually dump the dirty water in the toilet, then rinse out the bucket and brush in the tub.  Which makes the tub really dirty and in need of cleaning.  I have yet to find a better way to get rid of what the vacuum picks up.  But at least it's not on the floors where my little ones play!!All in all, the fact I can vacuum and wash my hard wood floors with out having to prep them - is a huge time saver.  I pull it out weekly and do the kitchen, bathroom, living room, hallways and kids rooms within about an hour or so (I have a pretty small home).  And the fact this is gentle enough to clean my old wood floors with out damaging them further is a huge plus.I did not purchase this from Amazon but instead on Bisslls website.  I received all three cleaning solutions, a warranty and a $50 a month payment plan for the same price as on amazon - so definitely shop around!",
T. Palmer,1.0 out of 5 stars,More Trouble Than It's Worth,the United States,13-Apr-20,CrossWave,,"I was thrilled when I found a like-new Crosswave at a thrift store for $50.  All of the functions work, but the results are still not worth the hassle.  Even at $50 it's not worth it.  Like every other reviewer, I am left with dull, muddy floors and wet wheel streaks.  If it catches a speck of the charcoal from a cat litter box, I get black lines.  More often than not I have to do an ""old fashioned"" mopping behind this thing to get my floors clean.  Lived in Italy 9 years where they simply use water with some ammonia and a brush to push around an old dishtowel.  That's worked fine for 2,000 years and it works for me too.",
Olivia,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have if you have toddlers,the United States,30-Nov-16,CrossWave,,"Update: Bissell to the rescue once again!The more I use this thing, the more I love it. I was faced with the biggest, messiest challenge this morning. My two young toddlers dumped a half bottle of dawn dish soap all over the kitchen floor and smeared it all over. I was hesitant to use the bissell as I didn't know how that much soap would react to the machine. I started with a mop and towels and had absolutely no luck as it only smeared the soap. I called bissell to ask if it was safe to use the crosswave on that much soap and she assured me that it was. After 3 passes and rinsing the roller brush out twice, my floors are soap free and residue free. This little machine does it all. I've sucked up bowels of cereal, spaghetti, broken eggs, and even tamales.I've always liked bissell products but when I was trying to find a wet floor cleaner a few years back, the only thing I was able to find that I thought would meet my needs was the Hoover floormate. It was ok but I never really liked it. It left circular rings on my floor and it was so heavy and hard to push. I recently seen the bissell crosswave advertised on tv and knowing I've always had great luck with bissell products, I knew I wanted to give it a try. I actually bought mine from kohls. Well I've been using it everyday, sometimes twice a day due to two messy toddlers at meal times. This thing does a fantastic job cleaning and it's so light weight, it maneuvers easily. The machine parts cleans up really nice as well. It does take a little time to clean the brush and dirty container but no more time than it takes to clean a mop and bucket. I am beyond impressed by this cleaner, I'll recommended it to my family and friends. However, it doesn't clean the rugs all that great if it already has set in stains but I still use it on my rugs in between times when I'll throw them in the washer so it serves me good. My daughter did throw up on the rug and I used this right away and it sucked it right up. So it's good for fresh messes.",
Georgia Girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Miricle Macine! Finally My Floors are Really Clean!!,the United States,14-Feb-17,CrossWave,,"I have used the swifter pads which I didn't like and switched to the Ocedar Microfiber Flip mop.  It was easy to use and ok, but I never thought my hardwoods were really clean. When I mopped up spills with a paper towel, there was always grey dirt, too, even after mopping with the Ocedar. With three messy elderly cats, I needed to try something different and EASY! My neighbor suggested the Hoover Floormate, which worked well for her but in researching the reviews I came across the Bissell Crosswave. Even though it was more expensive, I liked the good reviews and features such as separate clean and dirty water containers.  I decided to try it and WOW what a difference. I used just plain warm water to test it out in my kitchen and was amazed at how dirty the water it sucked up was. I went over the floor a second time and more dirt. I felt that my hardwoods were finally clean and the floor looked great.  I think if I use the cleaning solution, it will be even better. Later that evening when I used a paper towel to mop up some cat food, that grey dirt wasn't there.  I tried the Crosswave on the tile on my screened porch and it worked great. The only negative is that it's a little time consuming to clean up after using it since you have to clean the dirty water container, filter and roller brush, but that's a small price to pay for really clean floors. Also, you have to be sure the clean water container is attached correctly or the machine will leak when turned off. I confess I didn't get this at Amazon and instead ordered it from a TV shopping network. No matter where you get it, the Crosswave won't disappoint!!",
Brian S. Bailey,1.0 out of 5 stars,HATE IT!!!!!!,the United States,14-Apr-18,CrossWave,,"Pros: great idea, easy to assemble,Cons: expensive filter cartridges and replacement heads, leaves streaks no mater how much you clean the bottom, hard to break down and clean after use, heavy, plastic tab broke after a few uses.I bought this from Bissell on a payment plan when it first came out. I was excited since we have laminate and tile throughout our home. I thought this would save me a step in the cleaning process. I am so disappointed that the cons are so bad that I have only used it three times. It's such a piece of junk that I'm embarrassed to admit I Paid almost 300 bucks on this thing. The machine sits in a corner of my laundry room because I just don't want to deal with breaking it down to clean it after it leaves grey streaked on my floors. I wish I had a time machine and my money back. An expensive mistake.",2
Blahsblah2001,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pointless middleman,the United States,5-Feb-19,CrossWave,,"I got this because I have pets and a baby, and thought it would be a good way to clean up pet hair and baby food.Unfortunately the entire vacuum has to be completely cleaned out after EVERY use. Any water or food particles left inside will quickly begin to rot. So instead of cleaning baby food off the floor, I get to clean baby food out of a vacuum.Moreover, after being washed, the parts all have to be left out to dry. If they’re re-assembled they just mildew. I learned that one the hard way and had to throw away a filter and a brush.So basically its faster, easier, and less gross to just wipe up messes. Even for people like me with limited mobility, it’s easier to just use paper towels.As for pet hair- get a roomba. It does a better job and you won’t have to pick disgusting wet hair out of a brush.",One
Pen Name,1.0 out of 5 stars,There are not words for how much I hate this product,the United States,9-Sep-18,CrossWave,,"This thing is absolutely horrible! First of all, it didn't come with instructions- very low cheap for how much it cost.To use the mop feature, which is what I wanted it for- you have to hold down the mop button the entire time! This is a poor design feature.My house recently flooded and so after getting all the water out, sweeping, vacuuming, moping and sweeping again, I decided to give the ""Bissell CrossWave Floor and Carpet Cleaner with Wet-Dry Vacuum"" another try to ""polish"" off my tile floor- NO it couldn't even do that! The mop cleans in uneven streaks, and before I had even done the 2nd room (entry hall, living room- the entry hall shouldn't even count as a full room) it was leaving huge puddles of dirty water on my floor!!! How is it supposed to be cleaning my floor if it is leaving dirty puddles everywhere?This thing is horrible, if I could give it negative stars, I would.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,You will be shocked what it gets up!,the United States,20-Feb-19,CrossWave,,"We pulled up our carpet to lay a laminate wood floor only to discover beautiful oak floors. I knew with them being under carpet at least 60 yrs they were beyond a mop so I splurged on this machine. I was SHOCKED how well it worked! As you can see from the bucket there is literally mud at bottom of container once I dumped the dirty water. I dumped about 10 of these over 400 sq ft, proof my floors were beyond a mop. I went over my floors 3x til water was clean. I see ppl complaining it leaves streaks, it will unless you clean the brush. It tells you to put your machine in tray provided add water to tray. Turn machine on and pull handle back to engage spinning of brush. It cleans itself in the tray. I had to do this beacuse my floors were quite dirty. Once cleaned I carried on cleaning with no streaks. I'm impressed with this machine and plan on using it on my tile floors.",
kkr,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't hate cleaning the floors anymore.,the United States,27-May-17,CrossWave,,"I got this just a few weeks ago so have used it several times on wood and tile floors. The machine does a good job cleaning floors and is easy to clean, but dismantle it to dry thoroughly. Always clean the machine after each use, this is something all Bissell machines appreciate and I've had several.  The solutions that come with it are expensive and only so-so cleaners.  I have used Mr Clean, Murphy's Oil Soap and Bleach water with a few drops of dish liquid with out any issues and they smell better. Definitely worth the hefty $250 price for the quality of clean and ease of use. No more pushing muddy water around with a mop for me.One year later...I have used this several times on rugs and carpet.  I still use only Mr. Clean or Lysol but remember to thoroughly rinse your rugs after.  No big deal, just swap water into the solution canister and go. Extraction is sufficient but not recommended for high quality carpets, get a Bissell Carper Cleaner. I've noticed several comments about the amount of time this system requires to clean and maintain.  It's a tool, you need to take care of it and it will last.  Clean it every time you use it.  And about those streaks....clean the floor better and don't try to rush, this thing will suck up all your dirt when you spend the time doing it.",
michelle,2.0 out of 5 stars,Only works a few times,the United States,24-Feb-19,CrossWave,,After the first 2-3 uses I swore this was the best thing ever invented but then it stopped cleaning I think the brush roller breaks down after the first few uses and then just seems to smear the dirt around the floor. I can see uneven marks and some spots have water sitting there. This surely got my floor the cleanest ever the first time I used it if Bissell can make that continue to work then I would purchase it for sure!! I was soooo sad after the first few uses.,3

I then quickly realized how much time and effort must go into this to clean it after each use. Who has time to mess with taking these pieces apart and cleaning the unit each time? I am not happy with the idea of cleaning my cleaner like you must to. I contacted Bissell and they have nothing to say since I didn't buy directly from them. I will not buy another Bissell product unless they offer to give a discount on a 2nd unit that doesn't require taking it apart to clean the gunk. Don't buy this one unless you don't mind a messy clean up process and one that takes longer to clean than to use!,

Liz Russell,2.0 out of 5 stars,Clogs easily and wet cleaning leaves behind more mess than you started with,the United States,7-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"Strongly recommend buying this at your local big box store (with a good return policy) and trying it out a couple times. The first time I tried it, I was thrilled --but it was evening and I only had time for a quick clean. Did a decent job though it left streaks behind. Since I care about cleanliness more than appearances, this didn't bother me and it seemed to pick up a lot of dirt. The cleanup process was a little time consuming but I believe that you have to maintain things if you want them to last, so no biggie. When I tried it a second time and had more time (and sunlight) to dedicate to evaluating its results, I was a lot less happy. We have two dogs, one Lab and one terrier with very little fur. Our 1000 sf house is not filthy. Yet this machine clogged SIX times during normal vacuuming. It left dirt behind even after I had just taken it apart which was very frustrating.The problem seems to be that the tube is very narrow and has a severe bend where it joins the dirt receptacle.  Couple normal amounts of dust/hair with any wet cleaning, and this equates to major clogging. (It was already clogging before I used the wet cleaning mode.) The proprietary cleaning product left an opaque and dull finish on all my surfaces and the vacuum left behind wheel marks and streaks. Again, I value cleanliness over streaks. But when I wiped the floor after cleaning, my white sock was dirty. The positives are that it does have a good amount of suction and left our area rugs looking much better; it maneuvers REALLY nicely and is very light weight.",
AvidReader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Small space dream,the United States,8-Oct-17,CrossWave,,"I bought this item locally when I was looking at wireless Dyson vacuums. I live is a 1200 sq ft apt with tile and carpet. I have 2 adorable fluffy cats --which means there is a constant battle with pet hair, litter, and general dust. I bought the Crosswave after watching a demonstration of its deep cleaning. At home, I found the Crosswave easy to use, easy to transition from floor to carpet, and for the first time in a while I my bare feet stay hair and litter free after vacuuming.Other reviewers have mentioned some hassle with cleaning out the dirty water tank and letting things dry out. It's a non-issue for me and assembling all the pieces takes about 3 minutes.I would deduct .5 stars for the model's difficulty mopping all the way to the wall. I still run my swifer along the baseboards to complete a clean. The suction and vacuum only feature works very well on the tile, but I'm not sure about the carpet. The key is to move slowly for the best clean. I can understand why those with a larger house might get frustrated with this product.All in all a great product and $$ saver reducing the amount of swifer pads I use and cheaper than the Dyson model I was looking to buy.",One
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but a bit disappointed,the United States,21-Mar-18,CrossWave,,"I purchased this product after doing tons of research. I have tile floor in the kitchen and wood floors throughout the apartment with area rugs in the living room and bedroom and a runner in the hallway. We do not wear shoes indoors and we do not have pets with fur/hair (we have a Sphynx cat so it doesn't count). I was eager for a product that I can use for all three and that will cut floor cleaning time. I was super excited once I received it and it couldn't be easier to put together and prepare for use.Cons: The first thing I noticed was how heavy it is. Also, the swivel feature isn't as ""swivelly"" as I would have liked so I had to move chairs and other items out of the way to get a good cleaning so that adds cleaning time because I wouldn't have to do this with a mop. Also, I have a narrow bathroom and I can't get around the toilet with this so either way I will have to sweep and mop that area. I couldn't get under beds or other furniture so I will have to sweep or mop under there eventually also. The cord is quite annoying but I guess that part was somewhat expected. I feel it could have benefited from a better cord situation- I feel it's primitive and sometimes I find myself throwing it over my shoulder because I just can't get used to it. It's a little hard to push on rugs and definitely a lot more solution is used during this process which I don't mind. The CrossWave is very loud and not smooth. In addition to the ""vacuuming"" noise, the wheels are heard on hard floors so it definitely isn't quiet. The clean up process was more complicated than what is demonstrated in their video but not as complicated as it can be with other vacuums or rug cleaners. It's fairly easy to clean the compartments but I can't help but be annoyed by having all of these pieces now laying around until they dry then put them all back into place the next day. I can of course take a rag or a paper towel and dry what I can then put it back into place but the roll and filter need to dry out before putting them back in.Pros: Easy to begin use, not having to strain a mop, continue lifting a bucket throughout the process, wash the mop, dry the mop, do an entire other sweeping or vacuuming process prior etc. I do not feel the need to sweep or vacuum prior and I don't experience any issues with my machine clogging but everyone's home is different. Initially I was concerned because I did not see my floors getting very wet and I felt this was a sign of the CrossWave being unable to clean my floors well. However, I must say that the amount of dirt at the end spoke for how well it worked. Prior to the Crosswave, we swept and mopped at least twice per week (bathroom and kitchen more often) and again we don't walk with shoes indoors so the amount of dirt it picked up was shocking. After using the CrossWave, I walked about the house barefoot and it felt very clean under my feet so that made me happy. I saw the difference in the rugs as well. I believe that suction is good and I could feel that when going over the rugs. I recently purchased the rug roll and cleaning solution so I'll update my review after I try that. I think the buttons are placed appropriately and are easy to use.Overall: I was a bit disappointed by the heaviness and loudness. I was looking for something I can use daily even for small spills. However, the fact that it cleaned my floors well has convinced me to keep it and made the above worth it. I'm considering buying another multi purpose roll and an extra filter so that I can just switch them out and put the others on a shelf to dry out so that it won't be a huge burden to use it more often for small jobs. I'm happy with the performance and I believe that over time I'll get used to the power cord.",3
A. Chesmore,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is okay, won't get off stuck on stains. Must clean after each use!",the United States,12-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"I purchased this from the infomercial. I have hardwood floors throughout downstairs, but our hallway to garage & bathroom are tile. I have 2 boys and my floors pretty much need to be cleaned every other day. I usually sweep up the big stuff, then vacuum, then I was using the Bona floor cleaner. When I heard the all in one I was sold.**You must clean this out after every single use or it will smell like sewer. I made that mistake once when I used it before work, then forgot to clean it out until the next day. NASTY! I had to bleach the little filter & it's still not back to normal. The water simply can't sit there w/out smelling, so make sure you clean every part of it before you put it away. This does not clean hard stains, for example if you spill sauce and you try this cleaner the next day, it won't come up. You have to still scrub it. I wouldn't vacuum up pieces of food in this because it has the scrub brush, and just gets stuck.My overall review is that I do like it if I use it right away, but I don' tuse if often because I don't have the time to clean it out. (The filter takes 24 hrs to dry)",One
Amy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,4-Feb-20,CrossWave,,"This product cost nearly $300, and I had high expectations for a great wet/dry vacuum, which I bought it as a Christmas present for my mother - we both wanted it. The wet function is terrible - it leaves streaks and puddles everywhere. The ""cleans itself"" function is a joke - it just spins in the little tray and makes a bigger mess everywhere - you definitely have to take it apart every time to clean it, or the smell is horrendous. That wouldn't be a problem if the whole thing worked, but it doesn't. As for suction, it is really weak. On a wood or tile floor, it just blows debris into another direction before you can even try to vacuum it up.  If you try to use it even a very low pile rug, it barely suctions - even after multiple passes. When I called customer service to send it back, they said no, because I was 4 days out of the 30 day money back guarantee. And that was because I bought it before Christmas, and we didn't even open it until after. We used it three times and gave up. Complete waste of money.",One
Haily,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for weekly cleaning in complete hardwood floor house,the United States,17-Nov-20,CrossWave,,"This product is pretty great. I live in a house that has all hardwood floor throughout, which gets pretty dirty pretty fast. It’s a good machine for weekly cleaning. My floors are shinier and they actually feel cleaner on bare feet. Of course, it doesn’t do a totally perfect job but that’s to be expected from a machine. If you want floors that have 0 dirt then you need to scrub them yourself. All in all, this machine does everything as advertised and then some. I would buy this again, as well as gift it to others.",2
Odin1806,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can dry vacuum as well!,the United States,15-Jan-17,CrossWave,,"First I will say this. The only thing I was worried about after hearing about this vacuum was if you can use it just as a vacuum. You can. I call the help line after opening it up and she verified for me that you can operate the vacuum without any water or solution as a ""dry vacuum"" she called it. Very nice to know.So, I got one of these for Christmas. Just used it the first time a few days ago. Setting everything up was easy and there are only three buttons. Super simple. My wife's first reaction was that the cleaning solution smells great (just the one from the package) and her second reaction was that it was loud. For me I noticed that the brush seems to not lave behind one full noticeable path of clean; multiple times might be needed to get everything... might just be my floor. The plug in is also a three prong. For me that is difficult because my house is not grounded and I only have the special outlets in a few places to accept the grounded plug. The cord is really long, that is great. Putting in solution and emptying and cleaning tanks was a breeze. I have not pulled it apart to get to the brush yet to clean that ( i noticed a film of dirt and gunk along the bottom of the vacuum) but the brush does not look to dirty yet. I am sure that is easy enough as well. All the tanks and filters are reusable as well so there is no need to stock up on anything but the cleaning solutions and maybe the other brushes if you want those. I am loving it so far as I expected I would.",

It is the best investment I got last Christmas 2019. I didn't realize our floors were that filthy until we used our Crosswave. We used this in conjunction with a highly recommended tile cleaner that I bought off here on Amazon (forgot the name). Our tiles look brand new! Make sure you clean it and air dry after a every (or a week's) use. It can get filthy and accumulate.  That's on you, not the machine. I highly recommend this product :)",

This machine get such amazing reviews online and word of mouth that I had to have it. We have hardwood (old and new) throughout the house. We have dogs, cats and at one point teenagers in and out of the house constantly so my floors get a lot of wear and tear and they get dirty fast! I've been struggling trying to get the floor as shiny and clean as possible. I've tried everything……steam mop, swiffering, hands and knees, different cleaners (including Bona) and I could never get the floors to shine or even appear clean. No matter what I did there was always a dull film look to the floor. It drove me insane…….to say the least! THIS MACHINE IS AMAZING!!! My floors look brand new!

Well, if does all that and it also shined up the floor nicely, including some areas that had been getting dull over the years. I am very happy with the purchase so far.

It doesn’t get all the way up against the baseboards though.HOWEVER, I went to use it today and the brush won’t spin. I contacted Bissell and I did everything according to the troubleshoot but it doesn’t work. This is a major disappointment for an item that we were expecting to use for many years.

Melanie SK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved me from hiring a house cleaner,the United States,24-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"I hate mopping, really hate it. It takes a lot of time. You have to get the bucket out of the closet. You have to fill it with water. You have to carry it around with you. And that's just after you completely vacuuming the floor. This has everything in one vacuum. I know that some people say that it's a pain in the neck to clean after and you have to empty the receptacle of water and whatever else is on your floor ,but that is nothing compared to the before and after of using a mop. I have used it twice already and am pleased with the results. Even my husband noticed that the cork flooring in our bedroom were clean and with the Bissell cleaner it has a nice soft glow. My condo is all wood and marble so I don't know about carpeting. I did try to my area rugs and it just sucked it up and it just stayed in one place and I couldn't move it, so I don't think this is good for area rugs. It does take a couple days for the roller to dry out but that is a minor inconvenience because I don't need to use it every day, once a week is fine. I really like this product I did not buy my Bissell from Amazon, I bought it from a local Box Store. But it is so great I just had to write my comments on Amazon to let everyone know that this Bissell cleaner has Set Me Free as far as having to call up and depend on a cleaning service  to clean my floors.",
Sara,5.0 out of 5 stars,Huge Timesaver! It's Perfection and I'm Picky.,the United States,28-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"With my other steam mop and vacuum it would take me 6 hours to clean my floors. With this it took less than 2. And I didn't need a warm bath to help my sore muscles. The machine did all the work for me! My 3100 sq foot house only needed the reservoir emptied once and a total of 2 tanks of water. I've never seen my floors shine or feel so clean. It's nice to walk on my tile and not have little pieces of dirt or tiny crumbs stuck to my bare feet (a huge pet peeve for me). For reference we have 3 dogs, a bird and a 5 year old who live with us. So I used my dyson to quickly vacuum before mopping due to the amount of dog hair from my malamute/lab/pit puppies. I was concerned it may clog the mop. After using this cleaner one time I'm realizing the investment I made was definitely worth it for the time I saved. I'm also impressed with the all purpose floor cleaner included. I have glossy tile floors throughout and my floors sparkle. I tried other brands and some left a greasy/waxy residue that didn't look clean.",
Michael W. Black,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is not a review of the use...,the United States,9-May-19,CrossWave,,"I haven't bought this yet, and from what I have foundout already I don't think I will. I have an older small Bissel carpet cleaner and was thinking I might want to try this; but I had thought it was a combo vacuum and carpet cleaner since the headline says that it is a floor and 'carpet' cleaner. Being the suspicious type, I downloaded the owners manual, and found out that this is not only NOT a dry vacuum; it is also NOT a carpet cleaner either! The manual says it is for 'area rugs; which is enormously different from low pile carpet.I am not quite disgusted, but am extremely annoyed at the misleading wording. This ad promotes it as a floor and carpet cleaner; and the manual says something totally different.",

I have three young kids and as much as I try, our floors get dirty pretty quickly. I asked for this for a gift thinking that it would help save cleaning time. The first couple times I used it,  it did work reasonabley well, but I felt like it didn't get stuff as clean as my steam mop that had died. Also it was somewhat difficult and annoying to really clean out (which you have to do or it might get mildewy/moldy). I actually was planning to return it, but missed the window because it took the person who gave it to me a while to get the stuff I needed to return it to me and then I didn't make it to the post office in time. It also just doesn't do that great a job of mopping. The vaccuum by itself is pretty good, but the mop feature really needs work still. I wish I had bought a lightweight vac and steam mop instead. I'm really, really dissappointed with this, but since it cost as much as it did, I'm not going to just throw it away. But it gets clogged anytime I use the mop feature (even though I clean it thouroughly each time). I had friends rave about the bissell symphony which is why I thought this with it's ability to scrub a little would be even better. Boy was I wrong. IF you are thinking of getting a combo one, get a symphony or look at another brand.",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,It doesn’t deserve the hype,the United States,8-Aug-20,CrossWave,,"This really doesn’t deserve the hype it is getting. I have two dogs and a toddler. My husband and I both used it to clean our hardwood while the other was gone and neither of us walked in and could tell the floors had been clean. They weren’t as dirty, yes but it doesn’t leave that “ah, it’s clean” feeling. It definitely doesn’t pick up more stuck on dirt like dried juice or mud. I did use this on my area rug that I had been looking for a carpet cleaner for. I was more happy with those results. I have a bissell steam mop that i love and I’m still going to be using it along with my shark stick vacuum. That combo leaves better results in my opinion. I Will keep this for my rugs which I think is a better description for it... an area rug cleaner.On a scale of 1-10 10 being the best clean, I give this a 7 for hardwood. 9 for area rugs.",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,You have to clean it thoroughly after EVERY USE.,the United States,3-Jan-18,CrossWave,,"As far as vacuums, this one is mediocre. I have a $40 Eureka that actually cleans slightly better than this as a vacuum. The dual feature, again, is just okay. It's useful for quick cleanups and when I am too lazy to pull out the Swiffer Wet Jet for mopping after cleaning up loose dirt. I use this in my kitchen as it tends to get dirty more quickly than the rest of the house and this lives in the pantry so it is easy to pull out and do a quick clean-up and wash the floor. HOWEVER, this is NOT for someone who minds cleaning the vacuum after EVERY USE. The tube for dirt is very narrow and the suction is not nearly powerful enough to overcome even light clogs (hair mixed with some dust bunnies). This is especially true if you are using the wet cleaning function.SUMMARY: I have hard surface floors throughout and prefer sweeping and mopping with a Swiffer to actually vacuuming. I use this maybe once a month, and don't mind cleaning it well after each use. If I had all carpets, or wanted to vacuum as my primary cleaning method, this vacuum would be a DISASTER and I would have had to return it.",One
J. West,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,10-May-19,CrossWave,,"If I could return this item at this point, I would! Two design flaws that prevent it from being an adequate 'vacuum'---a cylindrical shaped tube inside the collection cup that instantly clogs with dirt/debris. When this happens, the machine simply 'blows dirt around' on your floor---as others have described. The other flaw is a little rectangular trap in the vacuum head itself (visible when you open the door over the roller). Dust/debris traps here, again clogging the suction action. The wet cleaning feature also leaves streaks and dirt on the floor. This is the feature I MOST wanted to work effectively. Well, it does not!There are significant issues with this cleaner/wet-dry vacuum. Don't bother---it's not worth the money!!",

So I invested in a Bissell.  I am old school, I dust mop my floor before mopping....dust, hair and water...equals streaks and a hot mess, and I think it will help the machine last longer (hoping anyway) only 4 stars, because I need to see how durable this machine will last.

It is amazing! I swept and mopped my floors yesterday and today it still pulled water off my floor as black as coffee!!! So gross! It was so easy to use and has a nice long cord! It does a good job sucking the water back off the floor. If you want your floor bone dry you’ll have to do a couple of passes. It was also so easy to clean! I had a similar Hoover in the past and this is designed so much better! Anywhere that touches dirt or dirty water snaps out and can be cleaned. Lightweight enough that I could easily take it upstairs. I was able to do the living room, dining room, kitchen, and master bath with one tank of the solution (I don’t live in a mansion but I would say a pretty average size two story house, not small). It easily picked up dog hair and although I didn’t use it on the carpet or rug, I did use it on my memory foam bath mats! Highly recommend!!!",

lr,5.0 out of 5 stars,It Works!,the United States,1-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"Just arrived this morning and used it on my kitchen linoleum floor, so I have not tried it for very long. It cleaned the floor with slight dampness that dried in a few minutes. I have a floor that has dirt brought in by shoes and dogs and the usual food stuck to the floor spots. Before I would sweep and then use a Swifter with cleaning pads or Clorox mop with cleaning pads (both disposable and washable pads). I'd have to change pads several times per cleaning because the pads were so dirty, so the floor wasn't getting very clean and the grime on the pad was scratching the floor. I have bad knees, hip and back so pushing down hard, back and forth was not very comfortable. The CrossWave has wheels, it takes no pressure at all and seems to clean with fewer passes than a swifter type mop. The swivel head does a good job of getting into the toe kick space under my cabinets. Cord length is close to 25'. I also like the cleanliness of actually picking up dirt over a steam cleaner, my floors have too much grime to just sweep and steam. I would wait to review after using the CrossWave more, but this is my holiday treat to myself and maybe someone else is considering this. I didn't purchase through Amazon, I got it through a sizeable loyal customer discount at a department store.",

When I brought it home, I knew I was going to get in trouble, so through the laughter of looking at my husbands face, I pulled it quickly out of the box, put it together, and immediately started cleaning.Pros:Super easy to put together. No crazy parts. Simply snap the handle on and the cleaner tank and you're ready to go.Picks up massive amounts of pet hair (I have a lot of dogs and cats).Doesn't leave behind the gross soggy wet fur balls that some wet vacs can.Floors are really smooth and shiny.

Devon Hall,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst. Products. Ever. Don’t buy bissel!!!!,the United States,24-Jul-21,CrossWave,,"Reasons why I’ll never buy a bissel product again. We had the stain spot remover when we had carpet and it worked 3 times really well then stopped working altogether. Replaced parts and got one more use out of it then never suctioned again. But this product is the worst most expensive mistake of my life. The “mop” feature just leaves dirty water all over your floor, I tried vacuuming a normal rate then a very slow rate and sounded like it picked things up but instead it basically swept this off the rug we have. I wouldn’t waste your money on this. I bought a rubber pet broom and a pet floor vac (similar to hair salon vac) and that works perfect for our household.",
LW42,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell Really Does Mean Clean,the United States,30-Nov-17,CrossWave,,"I have 4 kids under the age of 7, so we have lots of messes to clean up, and the floor getting mopped usually isn't a priority. My husband got this for me about 3 weeks ago as an early Christmas gift and I love it! If you go at the baseboards head on it sucks up everything in the room. If things have been sitting for a little while it cleans it with ease. It even gets about 50% of the things that are dried on, when I switch to rug mode and go over the area a few times. When we run this after every meal, or messy craft, there's no reason to mop later because it gets things clean. Once the floors are dry there isn't even a sticky residue, which was my biggest worry. It cleaned up the pink watermelon my three year old dropped all over our white carpet, and it picks up almost everything my one year old drops on the floor. From the chewed up, spat out orange slices, to the half a yolk from a hard boiled egg (and the shells from them being peeled). There are some things it can't pick up, like orange peels, but my floors haven't been this easy to keep clean in 7 years.",2
JH,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this machine!,the United States,2-Jun-17,CrossWave,,I just received my bissell crosswave today. I was a little hesitant to order after some of the reviews but it still seemed like a good way to clean my wood floors. My entire first floor is engineered wood...about 1000 sq. Ft....and I hated the  thought of vacuuming then mopping them. I tried my new machine this morning and I absolutely love it. It does not get the floors super wet but I went slow enough where I felt they were getting enough water on them. I did not use the cleaner that came with it because I like to use vinegar and water  which is easy enough to put into the machine. I filled water to the water line and added vinegar to the upper line. The dirty water that I picked up was unbelievable. I just moved into a brand-new house and thought they would be cleaner. The reviews are right about the edges not quite getting clean but this machine is so nice that I'm fine with running a dust mop around the edge as needed. This machine is so nice and so easy to use that I am relieved I found something so easy to keep my wood floors clean. Very happy I purchased it!,
Bernie Bridget,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and a GREAT cleaner!,the United States,28-Apr-18,CrossWave,,"I have this machine.  I obtained it from another source and am thankful I discovered the best floor machine on the market for my hard floors.  It is very lightweight with a nice long handle making it very easy on your back and it's relatively easy to clean the machine guts when you're done.  With all that said, if you've ever used a steam vac by a well known company you might understand why I'm so positive about the CrossWave.  What a coup for Bissell developing a machine with so many great features and it vacuums AND washes simultaneously resulting in gorgeous floors!

It's not perfect, it doesn't get stuff that has been stuck for days, but it does suck things up and it does clean the floor. It's great for cleaning daily or every other day, more like maintenance cleaning or current messes. Things that have been stuck for a while will probably need to be cleaned by hand.",2
Evelyn A. Pyrek,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,the United States,20-Mar-20,CrossWave,,"Purchased this from Kohls on Black Friday for $199.99.It worked well the first two times I used it, but after that it became a nightmare. The suction power is weak.I have two long-hair chihuahuas, as you can imagine they shed a lot. And we have thick carpeting in most of the rooms in the house. I purchases this hoping it would perform as advertised and as the Amazon reviews claimed. It did not. There are two options with this vacuum, either go over the hair over and over and it might pick some of it up or it just gathers all the fur into a clump that you end up picking up and throwing out.On hardwood floors same issue and the cleaning solution leaves horrendous streaks.What a disappointment.See my video.",
ray,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would be 5 starts if it could scrub better,the United States,21-May-19,CrossWave,,"Update:It has been over a year but I moved to a place that has all hard floors so I am using the CrossWave sometimes 5 times in the same day. The machines works as well as it did the first day I got it and it even surprises me with some spots it can scrub at if I let it sit long enough.The other day maybe 5 cups of this marinade I made slipped off the counter onto the floor. It had some small chunky parts but a lot of liquid. The CrossWave cleaned it all up, not a spot left in mere seconds.With that said,  I do find that I need to break out the old mop once a month and use the swifter sweeper at least once a week to not only get spots but to get corners and do a thorough cleaning. I purchased some replacements rolls, perhaps when I try those it will be more effective.This machines really makes keeping the floors clean a lot easier. If it lasts another year I am going to change to 5 stars but I would really like something with more scrubbing power.Original review:This thing does 99% of any job and makes it so easy. It will vacuum up any spill from solids to liquids and leave the floor spotless.I can easily keep my floors clean with this thing because it's effortless to run it across. I even use it to vacuum my carpet.The only downside is that it just does not have scrubbing power. There are some thing that got stuck to my floor that I thought this machine would be able to take care of but it doesn't but  great for routine cleaning as well as any type of emergency quick clean.",
1mercury,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best ever for Pets,the United States,3-Sep-19,CrossWave,,This is a very nice machine.  It is 2 in 1 and cuts down on cleaning time.  I got really tired of mopping & rinsing floors.  It is lightweight & easy to manage.  My son put it together for me.  We tried it out in the hallway & then checked to see what we think.  It cleaned the floor very well & vacuumed it as well.  Easy to maneuver.  I just love it.  Fantastic for me.  I have 2 dogs (one is only 10 mos old).  Both dogs were adopted out of shelters.  Teddie is just a puppy so it helps cleaning up the mess & making sure the floors are sanitary.  Ty Ty (Tyson) is older than Teddie but still makes a mess every now & then.,
Terry,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't clean up dried on food,the United States,13-Oct-19,CrossWave,,"This will be my three floor cleaner over 12 years. My other 2 have been Hoovers. I was hoping this was better and it might be just a bit but it does not clean up dried on food. I have a spot that had dried on spaghetti sauce and it wouldn't pick it up. So like with the Hoovers, I have to use very hot water. I usually pour it right on the section and let it sit a bit before I go over it with the cleaner. I was really hoping this one would be different. I do like the idea of using it on area rugs. I just bought it so I haven't had a chance to try it yet. I will still use it, I will just have to keep very hot water on hand with it.",
ctsummer8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Two thumbs up!,the United States,17-Apr-17,CrossWave,,"I purchased this bissell crosswave from kohls. I had a coupon and received kohls cash, so it was a super good price! I was pretty skeptical of the product prior to purchasing. Was it to good to be true? My entire downstairs is hardwood floors, with some scattered area rugs. (The upstairs is all carpet, which I own the bissell proheat 2x pet revolution, amazing product by the way.)We have two long haired German shepherds, and a goldendoodle. I didn't think this could outstand the crazy amount of dog hair or tracked in mud from the dogs and family, but it did!! I was amazed on how much dog hair this machine picked up! Also, it did not get stuck around the roller! The cleaning product that came with the crosswave is great. I diluted it a little more, and it worked just as good. It didn't leave streaks at all! And I think eh floors dried pretty quick. It is loud, but not has loud as my dyson vacuum. Some reviewers said that cleaning the crosswave after use was a pain, but I didn't think so. After you use it a few times, you get your routine down. I do believe when using any product, maintaince is key. Prior to owning this, I would rinse out my mop and bucket, similar situation. You rinse out the brush roll, machine, and dirty container. It doesn't take very long. I appreciate the time saved with vacuuming and mopping. It does it all. Also, it does a great job at freshening up area rugs. I wouldn't say it ""deep cleans"" but it is great for quick mud spots or surface dirt.",
CathyP,5.0 out of 5 stars,All in one makes cleaning floors much easier!,the United States,30-Apr-19,CrossWave,,"I’ve never been more thrilled with a multi- surface floor cleaner in my life!  The Bissell Crosswave not only vacuums up my kitchen messes, I also love it for cleaning my bedroom and bathroom floors as well. I have tile and natural hardwood, and its cleaning power is amazing! It’s very easy to put together, use, and store. I love that it pushes easily, and the handle and cord are just the right length! I have 4 cats, and this cleans up their little messes quickly and effectively! What an efficient all in one floor cleaner where I can finally vacuum and mop all in one!  I’ve recommended this to all of my friends and family, as I don’t know how I’d live without it!",
DeeDeeB,2.0 out of 5 stars,Going back to the vendor.,the United States,2-Jan-17,CrossWave,,"Bought this on a home shopping channel. It's going back because it leaks.  I paid too much to see solution leaking. I even followed the directions and took my finger off the trigger and went over the area again, but you still see suds or soap or solution, whatever you wish to call it, on the floor,  especially when you're closer to the end of the cycle. If this had worked properly, it would have been great.  It makes a room smell quite nice.  I'd rather something that gets around toilets easier, you would still need a mop to do that depending on how your toilet, cabinet and tub are spaced apart. I also wish this cleaned by steam, so going back to look for something else.If you try to send your unit back, the handle comes out by removing the solution and water cup at the back of the unit, and right over the label with your serial number, is a circle.  You press a sharp item into that circle, I used scissors, and when you hear it click, then you can pull up the handle.  They make it so you think you can't return it, so I called Bissell to get that information.",
sandy piercey,1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE!!!,the United States,17-Jul-20,CrossWave,,"Do not buy this product. This product is way too overpriced. They only have a 60 day return policy and mine broke 70 days after purchase. Customer service is awful and do not care about you or your problem. At this point I can't get a refund, haven't been sent replacement parts so my $400 machine sits broken in my basement unable to be used.

Terry107,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing machine! Ditching my Floor Mate.,the United States,12-Sep-16,CrossWave,,"This gadget is awesome!! I've been using a Hoover FloorMate since at least 2005, maybe earlier. I purchased one when they were first released as an upgrade to my old FloorMax. I think I am on FloorMate #4 or #5 now. I find this machine to be quite similar in function but for my purposes, it seems to do everything just a little bit better. I have 3600 sq feet of hardwood minus small sections of ceramic tile in the bathroom areas and I clean them daily. These are the major differences for me:1. Moisture. The Floor Mate is a wet experience right out the box and the older the machine gets, the wetter it seems to leave the floor. This is not too much of an issue on tile but it isn't the best for hardwood. I find the Cross Wave cleaned my floors and left them drier.2. The Cross Wave seems to make better contact with the floor...at very least, my floor was definitely cleaner when I finished. After cleaning with my Floor Mate, some areas still felt dirty when I walked barefoot. I think it has to do with the brush and the suction. The cloth brushes get the job done better on hardwood in my opinion and the machine removed the water more effectively.3. The Area Rug thing was an awesome plus. I won't say my area rug is squeaky clean and cleaning the rug brush was a bit of a pain. You definitely want to vacuum the area rug first with a regular vacuum because you WILL be cleaning up all the fuzz and debris from the machine and the brush roll but as the Floor Mate does NOTHING with area rugs, they definitely get a thumbs up from me in this area. It did a decent job ""freshening"" the rug.4. Disassembling and cleaning the machine was nice! Well, it didn't make me squeal with joy or anything but they've done everything they could to make it less of a hassle. The brush rolls pop right out and I throw all the pieces into a bucket of clean hot water - brush rolls, shield that covers it, tank that holds the dirty water (WOW was it ever dirty)... I was truly impressed with the tray that holds the machine. You put everything back together, pour water into the tray and let the machine suck the clean water through leaving it thoroughly clean. They even included a small part to hold the wet brush rolls while they dry. Really, they've thought of everything and the tray is nice to sit beneath the machine to prevent leaks on the floor. My Floor Mates always developed leaks over time.5. Solutions were good but I prefer cleaning with something that leaves a nice pleasant scent. My floors looked and felt clean but after all that work, I want to SMELL the clean! I had no streaks on my hardwood (used hardwood solution with the multi-surface brush) and my area rug didn't smell like my dog anymore (used area rug solution with the area rug brush) - but it didn't smell like anything else either. I need some Fabuloso in my life.All in all, I wasn't sure I could justify paying nearly twice the price for this machine but I'm so satisfied with the performance I really don't mind the expense this time. I've been trotting around barefoot all day. Glad I took a chance on this one.Adding: In my old house, I had ceramic tile that was naturally textured. For a job like that, I think I would prefer the Floor Mate's brushes. I can't imagine this working as well on that particular surface (scrubbing grout, etc). Of course, I'll never really know for sure but It's definitely a winner on wood!",13
Kerry,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty happy with this purchase,the United States,21-Jul-18,CrossWave,,"Pretty happy with this purchase. Love that it both vacuums and cleans - but it isn't a 100% replacement because the water/cleaning solution doesn't totally get to the edges, so you can't get all the way up to the edges of things. I haven't used this on a rug yet but used on tile and hardwood and seemed to do a really nice job and drying time wasn't that long. Heads up, it is pretty gross to clean and that part is a little high maintenance (dirty water and debris are all in the same container so you don't really want to just dump that down your sink, and then after rinsing you need to let everything dry which takes some time before you put it all back together). But all in all I'm pretty happy with this and think it will make life a lot easier for weekly house cleaning.",
Megan,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE,the United States,18-Apr-21,CrossWave,,"LOOOOOOOVE. This is such a relief when it comes to floor cleaning. It cuts the normal process in half!

Trish Horton,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really easy to clean after use!,the United States,17-Dec-18,CrossWave,,"I wanted this thing since it first came out but just couldn’t bring myself to pay $250 for it, not knowing if it would be worth it or not. Then Black Friday  comes along and the price is lowered significantly and I go ahead and give it a shot. Very easy to assemble and very easy to use. Cleaning it up after using it is awesome, especially with the included cleaning dish thing that comes with it. ( Took me a while to figure out what the heck that thing was )Downside that I’ve noticed -  The spray solution does not seem to evenly distribute across the roller brush, so cleaning occurs in streaks, instead of a nice solid stroke. I end up going over same area over and over to try and get all of it.",
PJCoolidge,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great suction and easy to manuever,the United States,4-Apr-20,CrossWave,,I was pretty tired of sweeping and mopping all the tile.

I am pretty disappointed to see all of the poor reviews as I have been very satisfied with this purchase. I will say that this is my 2nd crosswave. The first stopped realeasing cleaning solution when in use. I exchanged it for another and have not had any issues. I have 3 kids two of which are toddlers, a geriatric dog who sheds a lot, and we live on a dirt road. I was struggling to keep our tile and laminate floorsclean. I was vacuuming, swiffering and mopping several times a week. Now I can simply use the crosswave. I use it for both wet and dry cleaning. It’s amazing to see how much filth the crosswave is able to clean from the floor.  I couldn’t live without this item!",

Robert Blodgett,4.0 out of 5 stars,Crosswave Two Thumbs Up After 5 Months,the United States,26-Aug-18,CrossWave,,"I was uncertain at time of purchase about the effectiveness of the Crosswave. After using it for 5 months on wood floors I give it two thumbs up! We made the mistake of installing wood laminate floors, which are very susceptible to moisture distortion at the seams, in our all season room. Previously we cleaned them with a damp mop followed by a microfiber pad to dry it. We couldn't get a damp mop to be effective yet dry enough to protect the laminate floor from distortion. The Crosswave does the job without needing to follow up with the microfiber pad. Yay! It saves me time and effort!Cleaning the Crosswave takes some time to do it well especially in our home. We have dogs. The Crosswave picks up the dog hair well but getting it out of the dirty water tank and the tube that carries it to the tank takes time. However, I believe the time is well spent to prolong the usefulness of my Crosswave.I am very happy with the Crosswave. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the issue with edges and corners.We have no carpeting on which to test the Crosswave.",

I have a very large kitchen with a black granite floor and 8 dogs. My choice in flooring was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made, it shows everything and I had to be very careful on what I used to clean it because it would leave soap scum streaks and as you know, when you mop with a mop you end up mopping with dirty water, gross. The CrossWave left my floor looking amazing, no streaks, no scum and the water, OMG, the water was so gross I can't believe I was mopping with that water.

AlyOops,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is NOT a steam cleaner.,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave,,I will go back to my 30 year old vacuum and $10 sponge mop. Wet dirt is not fun to clean off/out of the machine. I reached down with a sponge after going over the same area of the linoleum several times and got the spot off the floor by hand. It's very noisy ( I wore earplugs). Using this machine takes at least 3x longer than doing it the old fashioned way and the floor is less clean. It would work on new floors with light dirt. My dogs were shaking their heads at the ridiculousness of it all.,

Kinkerbella,5.0 out of 5 stars,was going to but found a better deal elsewhere) but it deserves a review,the United States,21-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"Didn't buy this from Amazon (sorry Amazon, was going to but found a better deal elsewhere) but it deserves a review.  This machine is really amazing.  As others have said, the amount of dirt it seems to get is astounding off of what I thought were pretty clean floors!  It is very easy to use, the button placement is good, and the cord length is adequate (a little longer would be better, but that is always the case).  I can actually ""feel"" that my floors are very clean after using this.  I have all hardwood floor so this is a godsend for me.Two cons, but they are more than made up for by how well this works:1.  The machine is a little louder than some, but it's not too bad.2.  It does not edge very well because of the bulkiness of the head of the machine, nor does it go under things.  So you have to go back and hit edges with a flat mop or by hand.  That said, when I was done I didn't notice that anything looked that bad, and the only areas I had to go back and redo where areas with blatant debris that the mop didn't get.  I probably only have to hit the edges weekly, as this will do a sufficient job on a daily basis.Note:  While this does vacuum (and it does), I still vacuum beforehand, so it is not time saving to me in that regard.  I have pets, and if I didn't vacuum this machine would get very clogged up with hair and be a hassle.  But I don't mind this - I bought it for the mopping feature, not the vacuuming.  The fact that it does ""vacuum"" is an added bonus to get the little my vacuum left behind, or those dust bunnies that magically appear after you've vacuumed the whole house!Overall, I'm very pleased, and finally have a ""mop"" that I actually feel cleans my floors!",5
Cat Lover,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,the United States,18-Jul-18,CrossWave,,"I have been salivating over this for months, but it was too expensive. Thank you, Amazon, for Prime Day when I got $70 off. I just got this today. It arrived one day early and I have already put it together and cleaned my ultra disgusting floors in my kitchen (tile), dining room (wood), and entryway (tile).  It went so smoothly without any hiccup at all!  I am pleased as punch and would highly recommend this to anyone.  That being said, I gave it 5 stars, however, it does have one con that I have observed.  It is not enough to change my rating:  It will not clean up to an inch from the wall or appliances.  I will have to move my stove and refrigerator to get into the corners where the cleaner won't reach.  No biggie considering how well it cleans what it can reach.

K. weber,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Poorly designed, and so yucky to clean. Can't recommend!",the United States,1-Dec-18,CrossWave,,"I really wanted to love this, but I DON'T!  First, the cord attaches to the back at the very bottom so it is ALWAYS in your way.  And the cord winds around two plastic pieces in the back of the machine, so when the cord is put away it is not possible to replace the water tank after it dries without unwinding the entire cord and then rewinding it.But the worst part is cleaning the machine after use.  The machine needs to be taken apart and numerous pieces must be cleaned of the most disgusting yuck!  Stomach-turning aside....This machine is in no way a time saver.

I did my downstairs and changed the roll a few times ( it gets dirty) plus it was first real cleaning with the machine. It fit right in the space next to my fridge and it's now plugged in ready to go at any time. Works great on Dirt pee spills it cleans it all. So easy to change the rollers and wash. I rinse mine in the sink then use the pan. Just threw the mop out for good. Now I wish bissel could create a wall/ baseboard cleaner that works so well.

Pet messes, mud, or just weekly floor washing, it is so fast and easy. I read reviews that said it left too much water behind. They must not have ever washed a floor before. This leaves less water than if you were to wash the floor with a mop and bucket. In my bathroom, I sprayed the floor with a beach spray, and then went over it with the Bissell. The grout was like new, and I knew my floors were sanitized. OTHER Bissell products I've had broke (clips and such), so I am super gentle with all clip in parts.

It did an amazing job. Picked up all the dirt AND animal hair..a lot of animal hair lol. I hate cleaning my hard floors, but this will save me so much time, the cord is nice and long, and one canister was enough to clean all three rooms (about 900 sq ft or so).I feel like as long as you keep in mind that this machine wasn't designed to big up large chunks of things, or huge pieces of grass and the like...you will not be disappointed.The only reason it gets four instead of five stars is cleaning it at the end has a few steps and I'm lazy lol.",One
KSR,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've waited years for this machine!,the United States,13-Jun-17,CrossWave,,"Though I bought my CrossWave directly from Bissell I wanted to leave a review here.  So far, I love this machine.  I've waited years for a quick, efficient way to clean my cork and laminate floors that didn't use steam and would really get floors clean.... and this does a great job.  Even cleaning floors with a mop and cleaning the mop head frequently I could wipe the supposedly clean floors with a paper towel and still find dirt on it.  But after using the CrossWave the paper towel comes up clean and the dirty water tank is full of dark grey water.  My floors are clean, water is sucked up and not left to soak the floors and I am very, very pleased with the outcome. It does help if you go a litttle slowly over the floors, but considering the time it takes to sweep and then mop with regular mop and continually rinse and wring the cleaning pads, this machine definitely is worth it.",
Happy camper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dog Owners Dream!!!!!,the United States,22-Feb-18,CrossWave,,"Clearly Bissell knows pets - and how dirty they can make your floors!  With 3 large dogs in the house living in the Northeast my floors are always a mess, especially in spring and fall. I had a competitors product and thought it was great until I got the CrossWave!My largest male golden came in the house covered in mud and leaf pieces tonight after playing in the yard after a few days of winter thaw. Things hanging off his feathers, mud caked in his paws. I brushed him out, cleaned his paws and then brought out the CrossWave to clean up the aftermath - and what a job it did!!!!!!!!!It made quick work of the mess left behind from cleaning him off!  At first I thought it was a little annoying that you have to take it apart to clean it out, but after the disaster zone it cleaned tonight I was so happy to be able to easily get all the gunk  it cleaned up out of the machine. It easily sucked up the leaf pieces, pine needles and mud that this boy managed to get himself into in about 15 minutes of warm weather muddy playtime!Thank you Bissell for making this.",3
Kristy978,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great at first but Too much money for all its flaws,the United States,25-May-20,CrossWave,,"This was a very handy tool for high traffic areas, unfortunately they don’t last. I’ve had two of them go bad due to some defect in the handle (?) I was given the instructions to take it apart and put it back together, which will make it work again for about two minutes, or pack it up and ship back to the company at my expense. They are gross and difficult to clean and they do leave streaks or shoot dirty water out the bottom at times. Great concept, poor execution.",
J. Hutson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Clogs a lot and smears dirt,the United States,11-Apr-20,CrossWave,,It seems like a great idea except it doesn’t truly mop the floors. The water and dirt go into the same canister which causes for a lot of clogs and nasty canister clean up. The mop part leaves streaks everywhere and just smears the dirt around. I literally have to clean out the entire bissell after every use bc it’s clogged and clumped up.,One
Cassandra R,3.0 out of 5 stars,Expected more for the price,the United States,15-Apr-17,CrossWave,,"I saw this at Lowe's and was interested to see how well it worked....finally I bought it. It is convenient and does have a lot of features that allow you to keep the machine clean and odor free. I want to like it more than I do, it cleans well but I have a polished brown tile in my formal living areas. It does leave streaks and does not look clean when it dries. When I walk on the floor after I was done cleaning, you could see my feet print. The other tile we have is tan and it works for quick clean up in the kitchen after cooking. I just wish for 240+ I was in love and I'm not. I will be returning and exchanging for a steam mop.",3
sXenerdX,5.0 out of 5 stars,My floors have never been cleaner!,the United States,28-Feb-18,CrossWave,,"I have only just started using this but it was LOVE at first use. Make sure you read the manual completely before using (like they suggest). I have 5 kids, a husband, a dog, and a cat so our floors are always dirty. It takes me half a day just to sweep, vacuum, and then mop my living room, kitchen, and dining rooms which aren't even that big. I've tried different kinds of mops, solutions, etc. and my floors still always look worn and dirty. Today it took me a little over an hour to do all of that with one machine. I haven't tried the area rug option yet, planning on doing that soon and will update my review if my opinion ever changes. I wish the dirty water tank was a little bigger so I didn't have to change it out as frequently but it's not that big of a deal.",
ROCBuyer,3.0 out of 5 stars,... on an infomercial and thought it would be a good investment for my floors,the United States,16-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"I bought the CrossWave after seeing it on an infomercial and thought it would be a good investment for my floors.  While it does a good job cleaning, the biggest fail IMO is how it must be put back into the stationary position ""just so"" or the entire unit falls backward onto the floor, hard, due to it being so top heavy. One learns quick of course, but one ounce of distraction while cleaning and crash goes the CrossWave.  I'm surprised it hasn't busted yet since it's happened a few times already.  From a design perspective, not to mention the price, the user should not have to worry about this. Most of us are used to a simple set-and-click as with an upright vacuum, which is not the case with this machine.  Despite what I consider a flaw, the machine cleans nicely and delivers on its promise.",2
Troy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job compared to alternatives.  Check prices.,the United States,13-Sep-17,CrossWave,,"It works like most reviews state here.  Not quite the scrubbing action I would like on 1200sf of Ceramic tile but its better than anything I have seen on the market.  I hope they improves on a few things.1) Suction2) Stronger scrub brush3) Longer retractable cord.Lastly, I almost bought this on Amazon but found it at Costco for $179.  Check around on prices but this floor cleaner is worth it compared to steam cleaners (tends to remove sealants on grout) or mops.  The tank is really dirty so it is doing its job, just a few adjustments and it would be 5 stars.",2
Erin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pick ANYTHING ELSE.,the United States,27-Jun-17,CrossWave,,"I want to love this vacuum so much, I really really want to... but I can't.  I researched for a long time what kind of vacuum would be perfect for our new floor (we installed a beautiful dark laminate wood floor throughout the entire 2500 sq ft house.)  I needed something that would pick up all the dust, dirt, fuzzies, and dog hair that show up oh so vividly on dark floors.  I needed something with a cord, so the battery wouldn't run out halfway through.  I needed it to be light enough to take up along down the stairs.  I also needed it to not cost me my firstborn child.After some heavy researching, the Bissell Crosswave checked all those boxes.  I headed to my nearest store and picked one up.  At first I really liked it.  It maneuvers on a dime- the swivel mechanism is a dream!  The cord is pretty long (could be longer but it's adequate).  The bucket is easy to take out and dump.  The wet feature is nice for the door area where little doggy pawprints tend to accumulate.  So you're wondering why I don't love this vacuum?1. It is noisy.  This puppy is loud and obnoxious.  I'm pretty sure that in the vacuum world, a loud motor means more power and better suction. Yeah, I don't know about that.  It's just plain loud.2. It does not get edges AT ALL.  Every room that I vacuum with the Crosswave, I then have to go around all the edges with the hose on my other vacuum.  This is beyond inconvenient- it is frustrating.3.  The Crosswave does not work going backwards.  Typical vacuuming works like this:  you push the vacuum forward, you pull it back, you angle it over, you push it forward and pull it back, so on and so forth.  The problem with the Crosswave, is that when I pull it back, it brings everything along with it.  Then when I push it forward, it leaves a nice little line of dust/dirt/fluffies/dog hair, etc, that I then have to go over AGAIN, in another direction.  Imagine having to vacuum the same spot twice in every single room.  It literally takes twice as long and twice the effort to vacuum a room with the Crosswave. This design flaw is downright maddening.  I am *this close* to chucking it in the trash at this point. (My $30 Swiffer vac did a better job than the Crosswave, but the lack of battery life on the Swiffer is what prompted the switch.)Vacuuming is never fun, but this seemingly brilliant piece of machinery is sucking the life out of me, instead of sucking the dirt off my floors.  There are great reviews here, which is what helped me make my decision to purchase this, but please heed my warning that this vacuum is not all it's advertised to be.  Consider yourself warned.",3
roadrunner,2.0 out of 5 stars,NOPE- TOO MANY PROBLEMS...,the United States,26-Feb-17,CrossWave,,"This cleaner is heavy and cleans such a small track (lane ) due to the SMALL width of the head..If you have a house over 2000 SQ Feet - your in trouble..So you have to go back over an area NUMEROUS times and this machine is NOT light at al to push around..Plus the warranty is NOT long enough to cover the MANY, MANY things that can go wrong with this cleaner ( just a two year period)The BOTTOM LINE:I STILL have to MOP my tile floors AFTER using the crosswave because it doesnt do a thorough cleaning job..So what good does that do??

Should cost at the most $100...THANK GOD I got my money back as I bought it from another store...",One

Makes my acres of hardwoods look brand new and it’s so easy to use. It takes me about a quarter of the time to mop that it used to with a conventional mop or a wet jet. It’s fantastic! It doesn’t edge very well but I chase it around quickly with a damp mop ro get all the edges and under the edges of the area rugs. Takes no time at all.I’ve only used it to clean my area rugs once so far but it did a decent job. I prefer to vacuum first because I have dogs so this is the way I’ve used it.,2

I have to  lift into my laundry sink to clean out the bottom parts and then put it in the docking station to clean the rest of it.  I'm going to clean it up and see if I can sell it.  My fault that I bought cordless but it's not enough time to clean the kitchen, family living room and then I have to wait 4 hours til it recharges.  I called Bissell and they just said you may have to sweep up the litter first.  So disappointed.  I'm using my steamer by Mc Cullough and the floors look good.

I have dogs and cats so I would sweep before useing the Crosswave just to be on the safe side. I cleaned it after each use and was amazed at the dirty water and how clean my floors were after cleaning. It does not, unfortunately, clean right up to the wall, so there is about a 1 inch strip next to the wall that is not cleaned. This was another reason I would sweep first.I used my Crosswave 2 1/2 times when all of a sudden in the middle of cleaning it quit.

I have only used the multi floor cleaner and I plan to try the hardwood only solution at some point and hope it makes the wood floors a little shinier.  The clean up after the use takes a few minutes, but not overly burdensome. The cleaning tray is very handy.

Overall I'm pleased with the purchase. It is lightweight, easy to maneuver and to use. It is nice not to have to sweep first (although I did the first time but it still picked up an extraordinary amount of tiny sand-like particles). It's not great at edges or sticky blobs (dried yogurt or ketchup specifically) even when you repeatedly go over it. It is a nice convenient and compact machine that is way better than the sticky leavings from a swiffer. It's best for hard floors, but seems to be a decent small rug cleaner as well.

This machine does a good job but it is not a fast, efficient way of getting floors clean, no matter what a Youtube video says.

T0MWH0,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than the Hoover FloorMate, but with one tiny tiny annoyance.",the United States,22-Jun-18,CrossWave,,"I've had both this Bissell Crosswave, and Hoover's equivalent FloorMate. I like the Bissell much more: it gets the job done with a fraction of the water that the Hoover used (meaning you don't have to stop and empty/fill the water compartments as much), it is built in a way that makes disassembly and cleaning it super easy, and it is much more durable than the Hoover was (so far at least). The only drawback is that there is pretty big distance between the edge of the head and where the brush actually starts cleaning the floor--so you can't actually use it to clean within about an inch of a wall/baseboard/etc. Overall, though, this is well worth the money and every time I need to clean the floors I'm very glad I have this!",

Delta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Pet Owners,the United States,23-Mar-18,CrossWave,,"After first getting the Crosswave, excited to just give it a quick test drive, I cleaned a portion of my floors and the muck the Crosswave picked up from what was supposed to be a clean floor was simply horrifying and embarrassing, but I was grateful that I now had a tool that was going to help me clean up after our 9 cats and 2 dogs. With that flock of animals, I am always getting surprises - kitty litter outside of the boxes, hair balls, spit ups, vomits, pee, etc and the Crosswave is up to it all. I wouldn't necessarily say that my floors would be something you'd want to eat off, but they are now darn close, and my house smells clean. I've noticed that I have much less dust on my furniture since using the Crosswave. Anyone with animals needs this device; I now consider this an essential tool for pet clean ups.

Aside from the first month I had it, I've maybe only used it twice. Huge waste of the $250 I bought it for.Pros:*Easy to switch from hard floor to carpet.Cons:*Leaks. No matter how dry I get it before storing it away, I always find a puddle under it when I get it back out. Not sure if it's a defect with my particular one or not, but still.*Difficult to clean. It is it a huge pain to clean because what is vacuumed up gets soaked in water and formula and then caked to the inside.*Hard to keep clean. Everytime I use it, I have to do a thorough cleaning on it or else it smells terribly. Seriously takes at least a half-hour to clean the thing after every use. This makes it so I just don't use it. I'd much rather vacuum and then Swiffer. Shoot I'd rather mop on my hands and knees than deal with soaking and scrubbing the entire thing after.*Doesn't clean very well. My floors never look cleaner after. I actually just tried to clean my bathroom floors and noticed it wasn't doing anything so I ended up going over it with a Swiffer and got a bunch of dirt up.",
Nikki Pete,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great multi floor cleaner!,the United States,7-Feb-18,CrossWave,,"I had a floor cleaner, by another company, that I bought this Bissell to replace.  It still worked, but I really liked the features of this cleaner better... that it cleans the floor while also vacuuming up particles.  I was skeptical by the size of the water/solution tank, but was amazed at how far the water tank could clean.  I was able to clean an average sized kitchen, plus the hardwood floors in my dining room and living room on a single full tank.  I was shocked at how dirty my floors actually were when emptying the dirty water tank.  Clean up was a snap, by filling a little water in the cleaner tray, which conveniently cleaned my brush head.  I was very impressed, and pleased with my purchase.",
Sherry,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth the Price,the United States,20-Feb-20,CrossWave,,"I don't get it, this thing costs over $200 and it gets clogged with hair and dirt when you use the wet mop feature. I've had wet hair and dirt clogged up so bad and it's difficult to get it out cause it sticks inside the cavity. Anyone recommend a better way to clean it out? Also leaves a bad musty smell behind instead of clean. Suction isn't great and the roller dumps out dirt on the rugs when it move it over any rug area. Would not recommend!",
Jenraider72,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comparable to the Hoover Floormate...,the United States,14-Nov-16,CrossWave,,"So I've had 3 Hoover Floormates, the last 2 of which were still working when I got a newer model. This time I got the Crosswave to try instead. I really love these type machines but I'm staying with 4 stars until I try the area rug feature. I actually really do find it fun to use too. Check out the video for more. I bought this from Bissell directly and they may give more accessories than the Amazon version. I received the unit itself, 3 mini bottles of solution, the brush roll cleaning tray and 2 extra brush rolls.",16
C. Joyce,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent machine -- but cleaning chemicals gave my dog hives and now I use vinegar and water only,the United States,5-Nov-17,CrossWave,,"This machine makes cleaning hardwood and tiled floors easier than ever, and I do it more often, as a result. We do not wear shoes in the house, and still, every time I was the floors, it picks up a lot of dirt. This machine deserves 5 stars -- but I removed one star. Here's why.The cleaning formulas caused my dog to have hives. So I cannot use them anymore. And it if is bothering my dog, should I feel comfortable with my four-year-old playing on the floors? No. I need to remove a star for that.Now I used white vinegar and water, and it works well -- and it is much cheaper.",One
Trisha FosPhil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why did I wait so long to buy this?!,the United States,27-May-19,CrossWave,,"I have 3 dogs that shed and slobber like crazy.  Before, I would sweep, vacuum and then mop the whole house and it still didn't ever seem clean.  This does all 3 things at once.  Sometimes I still vacuum before I use this if the hair is really out of control but it has still cut my cleaning time in half.  The dirty water reservoir shows you just how disgusting your floors really are!  The only thing that I would add to this is a cleaning brush that was angled to clean the inside of where the vacuum sucks up the hair, it can get really clogged and it takes a bit of work to get all of the hair out.  I am not a very good housekeeper and only do the bare minimum...this has changed my cleaning habits in a good way!  So glad I finally took the financial plunge and bought this!",
Janet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my CrossWave,the United States,26-Sep-17,CrossWave,,"Love my CrossWave!  My floors have never been cleaner!  Works so much better than any other mop I've used.  I replaced another older Bissell vac/mop that did okay, but the CrossWave far surpasses my old one.  I ran a damp paper towel over a small area of the kitchen floor to see how well it did, and the paper towel was clean!  I also used the CrossWave to clean a white shag area rug that was getting a bit dingy and it worked well there too.  I was worried that the suction wouldn't be strong enough to get the moisture out of the rug, but it was no problem! I'm am impressed!  The only thing I dislike is having to clean the parts after use, but that's just the nature of the beast and really only takes a couple of minutes.  All the parts come out/off easily and are all easily cleaned, and the self cleaning feature seems to work well too.  Super happy with my purchase.",One
Allison,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed,the United States,3-Jul-18,CrossWave,,"I wanted one of these for a while and finally bought one. I was so disappointed. Our tile is very slightly textured and our hardwood is hand scraped so not completely smooth. This did a horrible job of cleaning our floors. Even if it had done a good job, I don’t know that I would’ve wanted to keep it bc it’s a gigantic pain to clean the containers and brush. I returned it and bought a robot vacuum and a swifter wet jet and I’m much happier.",2
Cedarg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,the United States,16-Mar-20,CrossWave,,"This Bissell is a great product, it works extremely well & is a huge time saver. Make sure you read directions and keep tank & filter clean. It can lose suction if your floor is too dusty, which means you'll need to clean the tank. The clean up is soooo easy, just follow the directions. And the self cleaning tray is a great feature making it even easier. Just make sure you move slow across the floor & use the right amount of fluid.I would highly recommend!",
Drew Ross,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine to maintain hardwood floors,the United States,4-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"I have nearly 1800 sq ft of hardwoods in my house. I have tried several cleaning machines and vacuums. We have settled on a system of general upkeep with a mini vacuum type device and then every couple of weeks we pull out this beauty. I have had similar models but this one is superior. I'll explain.The Bissell Crosswave cleans effortlessly. On hard woods, it rolls and swivels easily and doesn't require a lot of energy. It cleans the floors well as long as you are taking your time. The placement of the controls is intuitive and operate well. Getting it ready to use is simple, just fill the water to one line, then the detergent to another line. It does make quite a bit of noise, almost as much as a full vacuum. But it is light and maneuverable.While everything I've mentioned is good, none of here reasons are why I think this machine is superior. Truth be told, many machines on the market can say what I've already shared. But what is different about this one is how easy it is to clean. If you have ever owned a carpet or hardwood cleaner, the clean up is a nightmare. But with he way this one disassembles, it makes it very simple.I remove the dirt container, pour the water out in the back yard. Clean out the gunk with a paper towel. Rinse the inside out. Then dry with a paper towel. Then you take off the roller cover (see photo), remove the roller, rinse it out well and set it out to dry. Then wipe the place where it seats with another paper towel and you're finished. I was shocked. If you don't clean it every time, it will eventually stopping working well at all, no matter which one you buy.This machine does an excellent job, it's easy to use and easy to clean. Your hardwoods will look better than ever.",60
Niki Soesbe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, 5 stars",the United States,9-Jan-18,CrossWave,,"I absolutely love this floor cleaner. It is the floor cleaner to end all other floor cleaners. Ours rarely ever gets unplugged and put away until after all 4 kids are off to bed. It works wonder for quick spills and it's easy to deep clean my floors weekly. Our home is spread out over 4 levels and there isn't one inch of carpeted space. Cleaning the floors used to be a headache, a hassle, and the bane of my existence. It's so easy now and my floors FEEL cleaner. I have recommended this to everyone I know, I have shared my love for this machine numerous times, and I will continue to do so. It would be unfair for me to not add that the very outer edge of the room does not get as clean as the rest of the floor space because you run into the wall, but nothing is perfect so, I have changed my cleaning routine a little bit. Spray down the edges and wipe before running the machine on deep clean days. Even that little setback doesn't stop me from saying it's a 5 star product.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my savior!!,the United States,3-Aug-18,CrossWave,,"I had been eyeing this for awhile. Purchased this on Prime day and I regret nothing! I loathe sweeping and mopping. I find vacuuming much easier. This was a perfect combination. I don’t use it on my rugs so I can’t give you a review on that part. It cleans really well (see photo), comes apart easily for cleaning and the multi surface cleaner doesn’t leave a residue. I will say it is pretty loud and the filter takes about 24hrs to dry... those are my only complaints and honestly, they aren’t really complaints.",One
Barbie Barker,5.0 out of 5 stars,TRUE ALL-IN-ONE DREAM MACHINE,the United States,20-Jan-17,CrossWave,,"This machine has shocked me! It works like a magical dream come true! It makes me think about the futuristic, perfect, all-in-one machines our mothers and grandmothers must have dreamt about having. I expected an average moderately effective device with the occasional malfunctions you expect from new technology but i was wrong. Blown away by its durability, consistent performance and ease of use. THIS TRULY IS THE PERFECT, ALL-IN-ONE PRODUCT WE'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT! You may very well find that you dont need a broom, vacuume or mob after using the crossWave for the first time. The cleaning solution works exceptionally well and smells great. I did not order mine through amazon because i was able to split the payments up into four ordering directly through Bissell",
David J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF PEOPLE,the United States,20-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"If you have all 4 floors in your house (carpet, area rug, hardwood, tile), this is a great product to own, with a few drawbacks.  It comes with 3 brushes, a carpet/area rug brush, a hard floor brush, and a combination of the two.  I used this on the middle floor of my house which has all 4 of the different types of floor I mentioned.If you're expecting this to make your floors look brand new, this is not for you.  If you want a easy way to get a good clean all your floors, this is for you. I live in a 3400 square foot house, with my wife, 2 kids, and 2 dogs.  Our middle floor is roughly 800 square feet.TIME - it takes me usually about 1.5 hours to clean just the middle floor, that includes, vacuuming / sweeping, and mopping / waxing.  It takes me about 5 minutes to clean up (empty tray, empty bucket, and rinse out both).  With the Bissel Crosswave, it takes me 40-45 minutes, but with one drawback, the clean up takes close to 10-20 minutes.  So it doesn't cut your time in half, it cuts it by about a third with the cleaning, and I highly recommend cleaning it out after every use, otherwise your crosswave will develop a smell.CLEAN - it does a pretty good job (7.5 out of 10) at cleaning all of the floors. I give using a regular vacuum and using a mop 9 out of 10.  However, if you're expecting this to clean up a stain that is more than 48 hours old in carpet, it won't. If you're expecting this to clean up spaghetti sauce on tile that is a 5 days old, it wont. This is a machine for brand new messes or 48 hours or less mess, not for week of built in stuff.BRUSHES - The carpet brush does a pretty decent job on carpet for stains that are 48 hours or less (as long as you use the carpet brush). The carpet brush does not do a deep clean, it goes, at most,  1/8th of an inch deep. Not like a heavy duty carpet cleaner which can go up to a inch deep.  The combination brush does well on area rugs, tile, hardwood floor, but not so well on carpet. The hard floor bush does well on just hard floors obviously.  Does it beat a vacuum? No, but its pretty close. Does it beat a steamer mop? No, but its also pretty close.SHOULD YOU BUY IT - It depends! Which is probably why some people gave it a low rating.  For me, it was a no brainer. I have 2 dogs and 2 kids and all types of flooring on the middle floor. I have all just carpet upstairs and just carpet downstairs. So cleaning the middle floor was a breeze.  Then I would change the brush and head upstairs and do the whole upstairs. I use it 2 to 3 times a week, and I still vacuum and mop once every 7 -10 days.  If you have little kids, or dogs, or different types of flooring in your house, or plan on using this at least 2 times a week, then yes, this is for you.If your a neat freak and need everything SUPER clean, or if you only have adults in your house and are not very messy, or you only plan on using this just once a week, then this is not for you.I hope this review helps everyone with your purchase.",One
Rebecca,1.0 out of 5 stars,This vacuum is a rage-inducing monster.,the United States,7-Dec-19,CrossWave,,"My husband gave me this ""vacuum"" for Christmas...which was admittedly the first strike again it, but not the vacuum's fault. If I'd done the research myself, I would not have been sucked in by the ""it does it all"" marketing. In attempting to make this device do it all, they've created a monster that does nothing adequately.I'm extremely lucky to get through one room of our house before the vacuum is clogged. I now have a designated tiny fork that I use to clean this thing out entirely after every use. It will also randomly leak dirty water, leaving your rugs more dirty than when you started. BUT that's not all...your all-in-one machine also leaves behind a funky mold smell after every use.Bottom line - Even if it did work, you spend so much time cleaning out this machine, washing its various pieces, waiting for them to dry, and putting it back together that it completely negates any magical, miracle ideas you have about its ""all-in-one"" capabilities. Get yourself a broom and a simple, functioning vacuum. I'm sure Bissell has other great products, but this is just not one of them.One last thing - Fellas, if you are on here looking at vacuums to get as a gift for your girl, no.",
Richard Getz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Good For the Price,the United States,29-Feb-20,CrossWave,,"If you simply have surface dust you want to remove then this product will work for you. However, if you were thinking this was going to be more than a $99 Shark mop you may be disappointed.Also for the price I was expecting a bit more durability, but I've had to take it apart already to fix a stuck roller.Great concept. Needs to be built a bit better and have a heavier head to apply more downforce.",
kelsie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great disappointment,the United States,2-Dec-20,CrossWave,,This worked okay for about a month. You have to tear the whole thing down clean it . Then if you leave it sitting while cleaning the floor it will leave huge puddles of muddy water. Won't pickup small things off  the floor. Went back to using a broom and mop. Nothing is clogged doesn't have enough suction to do even minimum cleaning.,
Tiffany,4.0 out of 5 stars,Time saver!,the United States,27-Jun-19,CrossWave,,"I have a large dog, 3 cats, and 2 house bunnies. My dog and one of my cats are special needs/disabled. So we have a lot of fur, and lots of mess. When we got rid of the carpet and put in vinyl flooring I was vacuuming everyday I wasn't at work and I still couldn't keep up with my critters. I am a nurse so I work 3/off 4. I got this as a Christmas gift and it has been an absolute life saver. I still have to use my Dyson to ensure I have the big stuff/most of the pet fur taken care of when I do big cleanings every couple of weeks. But I am also to quickly clean my floors a couple times a week with this. My floors have never been this clean, and it cleans so much better than any other methods I have used. It also saves me time because I can use it on my hard floors, and area rugs. I don't have to switch equipment for different surfaces anymore. I would highly recommend this product. Just stay on top of cleaning it!",
Marti Larriva,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delightfully surprised,the United States,21-Feb-21,CrossWave,,"To be honest I had no clue that there was even this type of machine out there in the universe until a friend recommended a similar product. I bought it on a whim at Target and had to come here to review it because I literally cannot understand how I didn’t know this was a thing. It vacuums and mops and cleans my rugs! As a mom of 2 young kids I could not be happier to save the additional time running a vacuum and a rug vacuum and a mop. I feel like I’m living in an informercial. But seriously, every time I use this thing it brings me joy. Joy that something so simple could make my life so much easier. That joy is hard to come by these days, so kudos. I can’t speak to longevity since it’s been in my house less than a month, but so far so good!",
B. Nicole,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy it, you will love it!",the United States,24-Apr-17,CrossWave,,"Best floor cleaner that I have found yet for my all hardwood floors home. I no longer use my robot vacuum as this does a much better job.  It is so nice to make one run across the floor with this machine and have it accomplish vacuuming and mopping the floor at the same time. It works great on area rugs as well, although it tends to get stuck on my thicker living room rug, but this just proves how good the suction is on this bad boy.  I can clean my whole 2500 sq ft home with only 2 refills of the water tank and 2 empties of the dirty water container which is remarkably less work than sweeping and mopping.  Just make sure that you clean the compartments after each use or it will get a stale smell to it.",
Ghost,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works well but the SMELL IS DISGUSTING,the United States,21-Mar-21,CrossWave,,This is definitely great for sucking up LOOSE things! Not great for things stuck the the floor that have been there a day or more I still have to pull out my steam mop for sticky stuff. The one thing I ABSOLUTELY HATE is that if you don’t Clean this out every single time you use it it will have the most disgusting foul smell the next time you go to turn it on and use it. ITS NAUSEATING!,
J. Priester,4.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE THIS FLOOR CLEANER!,the United States,13-Nov-18,CrossWave,,"I use this on my 1700 SF home. All the floors are hard floors so it is used on all 1700 SF. It is by far the best cleaner I have used. It vacuums up and cleans very well, even dried on debris. It has a long cord to make it through a lot of rooms.The only CON I see is the cleaning area is very small. There are 2 inches on either side of the head that do not clean anything, which makes you have to work harder and longer because of the 4 inches you have lost of cleaning area. That is why I knocked it down to 4 stars instead of 5.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,WOW! I can finally see the color in my slate floors again!,the United States,30-Nov-17,CrossWave,,"As someone with a severe back injury but also 1,800 + s.f. of very difficult to clean slate floors, this little gem is long overdue in my household. I simply cannot describe the difference of ease of use. Additionally, the floors I had just recently mopped were still so dirty that the water returned to the Crosswave cleaner was not simply dirty, it was like black sludge. For the first time in years I can actually see the vibrant colors in my slate floors, and with no more energy than I would use with my Bissel pet hair vacuum cleaner. To say this little machine is amazing and a tremendous time and pain-saving device would be an understatement of epic proportions! My only recommendation is for Bissel to place a different type of material on the undercarriage as, for someone with hard-uneven floors like mine, the hard plastic gets chipped off in very short order. For now I keep a piece of duct tape across that section to minimize the damage but will actually call Bissel and see if I can't help them improve the design in this area. It's tremendously valuable and important for people with floors like mine.",One

It says to clean it by hand after each use. I find there is no way to get it really clean like that. It really should be removable and machine washable. As a result, the roller starts to stink! So I have had to buy brand news rollers and they are $10 a pop.Second- I have had issues with streaking.Third- cleaning the dirty water container is difficult.I read rave reviews before purchasing this. I don't know what I am doing wrong.",2
Music nerd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning services fear this device,the United States,17-Jan-17,CrossWave,,"Dust dust dust!  I have hardwood floors or tile throughout my house. Until this week, I also had dust on every surface because that's apparently where dust goes when one vacuums every day.Enter the cross wave.The control of a dyson ball vacuum.The ease of cleaning  the floors and the machine. Smart design for both.And now my house is cleaner than it's been since I had a cleaning service.One tip. While I like the cleaning tray in concept, it does spray water when used to clean the cross wave. Solution. Put a small amount of water in The bathtub. ¼ inch. Any more and common sense should kick in. DONT SUBMERGE THE MACHINE IN WATER!  Spraying water is contained. Unit is cleaned.",

I have a dog that sheds constantly. Instead of busting out the broom and mop, I can just use this.I felt like the floors were noticeably cleaner using this rather than the Swiffer.A ton of hair gets picked up from this thing, and surprisingly it doesn't get caught too much on the foam roller. I clean it after every use and make sure its dry before reassembling.It comes with a self cleaning tray and a holder for the foam roller.I am truly an adult because I get excited everytime I get to use it.",

Never have. I've vacuumed and mopped and hands/knees scrubbed my whoke house of wood floors for ever. Always felt on just spreading aroung the dirt and picking up maybe 70% of it every time. Then I invested in this machine. It's a new model, great reviews, and today I did the whole house. Huge difference , way cleaner that I could ever do, and way less effort to do it. Very satisfying dumping out the wastewater. Easy set up, clean up, and put away. The floor is fantastic. I'm thinking 95% of the dirt has been removed off the floor. Vacuum first, then fire up this machine. Amazing.",
CMURPHYLIFE,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Super All-In-One Cleaning Solution For Your Floors & A Huge Time Saver!,the United States,7-Jan-18,CrossWave,,"I recently moved from a 500 square foot house to a 2200 square foot house and after cleaning the floors twice in the new place I knew it was time for an upgrade. It took too much time and effort. First sweeping the entire house and then I used a Libman spray mop which you have to take off the pad and clean at least 5 times as it gets too dirty. And it doesn't collect all dirt, just moves it around. It was such a pain! After much searching I found this product and read and watched a lot of reviews before deciding to purchase. After one use I knew I made the right decision! The Bissell Crosswave is amazing! Is it perfect? No. But I can't imagine something being better than this. This cuts the cleaning in time by at least by half! It's light weight, very easy to disassemble and clean after and compact enough to fit almost anywhere when you put away. It's amazing how much dirt it sucks up too (who knew my floors were that dirty). I have porcelain tile floors and it does a much better job than a regular mop. Some complained about the electrical cord being too short but I think it's long enough and I do have to unplug and plug it in several times but it's not that big of a deal to me. Maybe in the future they will design a cordless model which will raise up the price but may be worth it to some.My only minor complaints would be that it doesn't get right to the edges of the walls. The closest you can get is about an inch away. It does suck up dust and debris from that close but won't wet mop those edges. So maybe once a week you'll have to go and run a mop down the edges of your walls which would probably take 5-10 minutes. The other minor complaint would be that it does leave a bit of streaking on the floors after. I don't notice it a lot on my floors (grey porcelain tile) but may be more noticeable on other floors? My libman spray mop left some streaking too so not a big deal for me. It also may be a little loud for some. Maybe slightly louder than a vacuum. But something to keep in mind.I've only had it for a few days and only used it a couple of times. As I had to haul this from the US to Central America I hope it has a long life and doesn't break down on me after only a few months. Perhaps I'll do an update after 3-6 months and then a year to see how it's holding up.But for now I love it and definitely recommend to those that have larger floor areas that want to significantly cut down on cleaning time. I dreaded cleaning my floors on a weekly basis but with this I would not mind doing it daily. Excellent product!",
Richard M Wright,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy customer,the United States,14-Apr-21,CrossWave,,The product works perfectly. The 1st time I clean my floors the water was black. I went over it a second time and the water was just slightly cloudy.  This seems to clean very well.,2

It did such an amazing job! I can NOT stress enough how great this is! Plus the floors dry way faster than when you mop. Bonus is this machine cleans carpets and area rugs too. You can use your own floor cleaner but the initial purchase came with a huge bottle of cleaner.... a large and small size all surface cleaner; a large and small size wood cleaner; and a large and small size carpet cleaner.

After living in the house for over 12 years I was just about to get the floors stripped and refinished. Along with the puppy I have another big lab and a cat. The floors are a constant issue to keep clean. I saw the power wave and I decided I had nothing to lose. I have had it for two months and the house has never looked so clean. I had a cleaning service That I would occasionally use ( at $150.00 a visit) , the crosswave if far superior.  Its fast and easy and actually fun to use. If you have high traffic in your house you wont be disappointed.",
Nancy Tibbetts,4.0 out of 5 stars,great little vacuum!,the United States,30-Nov-17,CrossWave,,Just got my Bissell CrossWave and it's amazing. I did my entire living room in about five minutes. I haven't used the wet vac function because I wanted to try the suction on a dry surface first. It did very well from Pergo to area rug. The brush heads are so easy to change! It's just a click off click on from the top. The only bad parts about this vacuum are that the tanks are small and it does not have a hose to do corners with. That being said the handle swivels so you can get into hard-to-reach places. It comes with the base to put the vacuum on and a drying rack for your brushes. I did not buy my vacuum on Amazon because Bissell was having a promotion.,
R T Cowgirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell Crosswave Review,the United States,6-May-18,CrossWave,,"Floors cleaner than ever!  It smoothly transitions from hard floor to rug.  Picks up the hair too, no need to vacuum first.  Floor almost dry when done, but I apply solution sparingly.  Mine came with a tray to flush out the system after use.  I like that.  I also got an extra multi purpose roller and filter so I can put the machine back together right after use instead of waiting for the roller and filter to dry.  Can't say how long it will last because I haven't had it very long.  I use the Multi-Surface cleaner in it because I have hard floors and rugs in the same room.",
Sandra Wheeler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Former Hoover Floormate User,the United States,20-Dec-17,CrossWave,,I've used a Hoover Floormate for over 10 years and have been happy with it. The Floormate stopped working and after much research I replaced it with the Bissell Crossover. The Crossover is much lighter and easier to maneuver and causes me less fatigue. It is easy to clean and maintain. It doses a great job of cleaning the floors and vacuuming at the same time. I found that pre-treating really dirty spots with the Bissell cleaning solutions really helps. The only task the Hoover does best is really heavy stuck on spots. The Crossover is more expensive but I am able to use it more regularly because it does not aggravate my back pain as much.,
Melissa A Fahey,1.0 out of 5 stars,"FOUR Crosswaves have failed, have to keep getting a warranty replacement!",the United States,22-Aug-18,CrossWave,,"We bought a Crosswave a year ago and are now on our FIFTH unit. They last for about 3 months and then the roller stops turning and the machine starts making a terrible grinding noise. Bissell just sends us a new one every time, but we have to send in the cord for the old one, wait a week for it to arrive to Bissell, wait another week for them to process the warranty return, and then another week for the new one to arrive. So, every time we're without a Crosswave for 3 weeks, and then a few months later the new one breaks IN THE SAME WAY. There is clearly a flaw in the Crosswave. I would like our money back or exchange to a different Bissell product. This thing is terrible.",
Love to be efficient,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good investment,the United States,10-Aug-20,CrossWave,,"I have ceramic tile and Pergo floors, and two big dogs. I have had this unit for about three years, and before I got it, I used to get down on my hands and knees to wash the floors. That became hard on me due to issues with my back and knees. This does the job well with minimal effort in less than half the time. I usually clean a section, then dry the floor with a towel to get it bone-dry. It can take a 2-3 passes to clean the heavily trafficked pet areas. I would definitely recommend it. It is easy to use, and easy to clean up the unit after use. Well worth the expense.",
Mary,5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT MACHINE!,the United States,27-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"I LOVE this machine!  It is by far the best floor cleaner I have ever purchased!  I have bought others in the past and was always disappointed.  Not this time!  This floor cleaner is lightweight, and very easy to use.  It is easy to clean the machine itself as well.  My floors are extremely clean now.  When we have visitors, they have also complimented how nice the floors look.  We have hardwood floors through out the house, and area rugs. I love that we can clean both with one machine, and that it does a great job on both!  The rugs come out clean and fresh smelling each time.  I would recommend that you rinse out the filter and the cleaning brush each time and let them dry before putting back into the machine.  I left the filter in the machine once and found there was an odor when I went to take it out to clean in the next day.  Best thing to do is to rinse right away and leave out to dry.  I plan to buy a second filter to have ready to put back into the machine while the other one is drying for the next use.  The hardwood floor cleaner has a very nice light lemon scent which I like very much.  However, I don't love the multi purpose floor cleaner scent.  It is okay, but not my favorite scent.  Still, it cleans very well which is most important.  Hoping they come out with some other scents like a nice pine scent.  The vacuum has excellent suction which makes this even more superior to other machines!  This machine is louder than others.  I am okay with this, but others might not be.  Finally, the machine is unable to clean all the way up to the wall.  It is not designed to be able to do that.  You will have to do the area right near the walls by hand.  Still, I find this to be the BEST multi purpose floor cleaner I have ever used!  I love this thing!  It does an excellent and thorough job every time!  I am so glad I found this!",One

We have mostly tile in our new home and it really is wonderfulto not have to vacuum or sweep before mopping.My husband said that probably  I use mine more than most,  because of the tile, and that it wasn’t built to last.Unfortunately, he was correct!

I have a LOT of tile, and I HATE sweeping and mopping. I saw a commercial for the Bissell Crosswave and was interested in trying it, but I was skeptical after reading the reviews. I received it recently as a birthday gift, and just tried it for the first time. OMG!!!! I LOVE this machine. You know the annoying dust or pet hair that collects in grout that doesn't loosen up until after you've swept, and you go over it with the mop? This thing sucks it right up!! It has plenty of suction power since it's a corded machine. It even sucks up scattered cat litter as well or better than a regular vacuum. To get the same results before, I had to sweep, swifter and mop. Some people commented that it would leave a line around baseboards. I did not have that problem at all. I have light colored tile that shows everything, and I am super impressed with how clean they are. I was not hoping for perfection. I just wanted something to make the job easier. It is quick, easy and leaves my floors looking and smelling like I spent a couple hours scrubbing them. Thank you, Bissell, for making such an innovative product that really works!",One
LaLaBelair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got dog hair or stone floors? Then the Crosswave is for you!,the United States,21-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"At first I wasn't sure I was going to like the Crosswave compared to my Bissell Spin Cleaner, but then after being able to clean the area rugs too with just a push of a button I was sold! Now I can't imagine not having it! It took me a couple of times using it to get the hang of it. I have 3 black Pugs & it picks up dog hair that even the vacuum missed. It uses less water & cleaner then my other Bissell which made me wonder how it was going to clean as well but it does. If you have a stone floor & throw rugs with dog hair don't be afraid to buy this. My floors & rugs are always clean now!",

I've tried it all from a Roomba, to a Shark Steam and Vac, to a Shark power mop. I've got 1900sq ft of tile, 1 small area rug, and a pair of cats. The CrossWave handled cat fur, cat litter, and spilled dry cat food with ease Great time saver since I don't have to sweep before mopping. It also handled a couple of remnants of hairballs that I didn't find when they were fresh. Needs sound to indicate that cleaning solution is out. Easy to recognize when dirty tank needs emptied. LOVE that it keeps cleaning solution tank separate from dirty tank - no more moving dirty water around. I bought mine locally at Target. The instruction manual seems one size fits all and it only comes with the multi-surface brush. However, I was able to get the area rug brush at a local Lowe's. OMG, the area rug looks brand new and the cats hang out on this rug a lot! Only cons are the pricetag and that it doesn't handled edges/corners or deep scrub of grout lines - but it gets the job mostly done and only a few touch-ups needed in those troublesome areas.",One

The BISSELL CrossWave is AMAZING!We have 4 adults, 2 toddlers, 8 dogs, and 4 cats in our house. We also live on a farm. We have mostly laminate flooring (we're remodeling so we still have some old tile and the basement is concrete). We have a few area rugs that naturally, over the course of time, get an animal potty accident and mud/dirt/rock salt tracked on and ground in. I had multiple brooms, two vacuums, a Swiffer wet mop, a steam mop, and an older carpet shampooer. I could not get/keep the floors and rugs clean. We bought this and the difference it has made is exponential. The dirt and hair it got off the floor after I'd already swept and steam mopped has no comparison. The rugs look brand new and they're a few years old and well used.I'm not saying this is a miracle product, but it replaced all my other cleaning tools, does a much better job, and is pretty dang close to a miracle.I would definitely recommend this product. It does seem on the higher price scale (at least to me anyway) but when you think about all the tools it's replacing within a single tool... it is fairly cheap.",One

After using this machine, all my concerns are gone. I am most impressed by the suction power and the ease of cleaning. This dispenses the perfect amount of water/solution mix to clean the floor without leaving them soaked. I can't get over how filthy the water was when I finished, I mopped with my traditional mop less than 24 hours ago too! I am so excited to find something I can quickly grab and save time by doing all the steps all at once. My 9 and 5 year old kids will now be able to scrub the floors with ease. I also love the cleaning tray for the rollers and the little drying stand for the rollers to stand up in, genius!!

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,It does not clean ceramic tile floors very well!,the United States,21-Apr-18,CrossWave,,"I am greatly dissappointed in the quality of cleaning from this floor cleaner.  We have about 1500 square feet of tile flooring in our house, which is in a wooded area.  Add two Great Danes, one not yet quite fully housebroken, and you have the ingredients for floor cleaning problems.  We have had several Hoover Floor Mates which do a great job, but have a fatal design flaw which renders them inoperable after too short a time period (6 to 12 months).  (Moist air from the floor being cleaned passes over steel parts in the vacuum motor, causing corrsosion, leading to failure.)  But, when working, it does a great job.By contrast, the Crosswave has two design problems preventing it from doing a quality cleaning.  First, the brushes are not aggressive enough.  (I have tried a couple of different ones.)  Second, the water removal sytem is not very effective.  It leaves too much moisture and dirty water on the floor.  Other than not providing very good cleaning, it is nicely designed and more user friendly than the Hoover.My credentials:  I have been a mechanical design engineer for a number of years, designing both consumer and industrial products.In just a few moments, after completing this review,  I will be visiting the website of my favorite online retailer (Amazon) and ordering another Hoover Floormate.  It will cost $100 less and last only a few months in our heavy duty use household, but the floors will be clean!  We will keep the Crosswave for emergency use.",

I thought ""this has to be too good to be true!"" Well, it's not! It sweeps and mops all in one fail swoop. My floors look so clean after a session of using it and it takes me even less than half the time because there is no bucket to get ready and no dustpan to bend over and use multiple times.

So when my wife surprised me with this vacuum and told me what it does, I was wicked skeptical. I had been using a dyson for the past 5 years and it always pissed me of, lacked suction and the beater bar never worked well enough.Now typically, something that does the job of two typically lacks at one of them. This isn’t the case for this vacuum. It works just as well dry as it does wet. Our house is mainly hardwood with area rugs and this is where this thing shines, figuratively and literally. My floors have never looked better and the area rugs have never looked/smelled better. Do note though, this is not a “carpet cleaner” per say. It’s not made to work on deep pile carpets and it doesn’t inject water deep into the carpet as a true carpet cleaner would.",
Amber FLYNN,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE this Machine!!!!  It Vacuums and Shampoos my Rugs!!  AWESOME!!,the United States,25-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"I am in AWE of this Amaaaaazzzzzing product.

Easy to assemble, easy to clean, and every time I use it I am in AWE of the amount of dirt and dog hair that comes up from my Rug!!!!What I love about the shampoo system is that it DOES NOT put a lot of water in the Rug.  You control that by the spray release on the handle.  That by the way, is super cool!!!  I hate waiting all day for my rugs to dry.  For high traffic places in my home I use this rug cleaner once a week.  And I have two dogs, and the amount of hair that it pulls up is JAW dropping!The maneuverability is awesome and turns on a dime, and the unit is super light and easy to carry around the house.  There is also a tray that comes with the unit that you put under the machine after you clean it for water drips!!  LOVE that.  And did I say it was easy to clean??  Soooo easy.

RITA E. HUDSON,5.0 out of 5 stars,MUCH BETTER THAN HOOVER FLOORMATE!!!,the United States,19-Jan-17,CrossWave,,"My wife purchased the multisurface kit from target so this isnt a verified purchase review. I always check amazon reviews before i buy anything so i figure others do also. She paid $249.00 at target and then i found that if you buy it directly from bissell you get a four year warranty, all three brushes and all three cleaning solutions for the same price. You can also pay for it with five monthly payments. Thats a great deal so back to target it went.I have owned two hoover floormates, the corded deluxe model and the cordless model, and they are the only hard surface cleaners that are comparable to the crosswave. I must say that when compared to the floormate the crosswave just blows it out of the water!I used the floormate deluxe for about two years and during that time i had several problems with it. The liquid dispenser quit working and then the power switch went out. I took it apart and found the dispenser valve was broke so we just started spraying the floor with cleaner from a spray bottle. I never fixed the power switch, we just unplugged it to turn it off.We thought the cordless model would be better because the cord on the deluxe was kinda short. We were wrong. The motor on the cordless went out after about three months of use. It was still under warranty but after reading about the warranty repair process taking several weeks i decided to replace the motor myself. Its a cheap 24 volt dc motor so i bought one on amazon and installed it. It worked fine with the new motor but by this time i was pretty unsatisfied with hoover and then we found the crosswave!The crosswave is better in every way. It cleans better, it dries better, it rolls better, it is much better to handle. The floormate brushes are not in the suction chamber so when you turn it off the brushes are soaking wet and will leave a messy wet spot on your floor. Not so with the crosswave, the brush is inside the suction chamber so it is sucking through the brush and will not leak on your floor after use.We have 1800 square feet of prefinished hardwood floors and three french bulldogs so we are constantly cleaning up some kinda mess. Prefinished floors have a slight beveled edge between the boards that the floormate could never clean because of the brush design. The crosswave has a horizontal spinning brush that gets down into these grooves and cleans them very well.I have found that the crosswave does require more cleaning solution mixed with the water but it uses much less overall water. I can clean a larger area without having to fill the solution tank. The floormate absolutely soaked the floor with water and would not dry it unless you went back over it several times.The crosswave leaves my floors looking much better also. Shiny, dry and streak free! Just a great floor cleaning machine.",

Irene Teichmiller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you've ever used a Hoover floormate, you won't believe how well this product works!",the United States,2-Sep-17,CrossWave,,"For over 10 years, I used a Hoover floormate on my mostly tiled 3500 square foot home.  The older wide path model was slow and loud but it cleaned my floors way better than a mop & bucket, so I dealt with it.  The floormate died shortly before I sold my home, and I bought the new model.  When I moved into my new home 2 years ago, I tried the new model once and it just didn't work well on my wood look tile floors that had grooves and dips,  not to mention I used the new one once and it BROKE.  I was forced to use a mop and bucket and recently after getting a new puppy and feeling like I couldn't walk on my floor without wearing socks, I went on the hunt for another solution.  I have many other bissel products (proheat carpet cleaner, spot not, Vacuum), so I thought I'd give this a chance and I'm so glad I did.  Not only is it twice as effective as the floormate, but it's twice as FAST!  If you just want to do a quick clean, you could clean 1,000 sq feet in less than an hour, maybe more.  The only issue with it that I've found is the foaming it creates, you have to work your cleaning path around it to pick up the dirty, foamy water.  I will say that I did try to sneak in some other cleaners than the one that you are instructed to use (bissel crosswave) and that probably has something to do with it, I would caution not to try to use other cleaners.I also used it on Berber carpet & a floor rug and it did well, the carpet got clean and was not crunchy.I cannot say enough about this machine, it's fantastic!",
Admin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shocked at the Sludge,the United States,14-Nov-16,CrossWave,,"If I could, I would be that person on the floor with an attachment to a drill, scrubbing every inch of my ceramic tile. But I physically can't. I would use Mr Clean pads on the whole floor if I could, but I can't do that either. So when hubs heard me lamenting about breaking another mop that I knew was not cleaning the 12 year old tile, he suggested I find an electric solution. My tile is rough surfaced and I knew it wasn't just my eyes; over time, it really appeared to be getting darker. I used a steam mop, Swiffer, a microfiber mop, a variety of cleaning products, and regular sweeping, but it wasn't helping. Finally, I did a test. I used the steam mop on the kitchen floor. Then I used a Nano Towel (awesome product BTW) and was shocked at the filth it brought up. The Nano is my go-to for spills and spot cleaning, but I needed a low-impact mop solution since my shoulders are shot.  Bissell has been my go-to for carpet cleaning, so after assessing the options, I chose the CrossWave. This is a great tool.  I have lots of tile, so I have done about 12 batches of solution and every time I end up with a used-water tank full of awful sludge to pour down the drain.  It requires very little effort to operate and my shoulders are thanking me. I'm sure lots of the sludge is from grout that was just getting wiped over by every other tool I've used.I have two complaints/observations:  I wish the handle was padded in some way to reduce stress on my ""trigger"" fingers, and it also doesn't clean all the way to the baseboard. There is about 1"" that I used a Mr Clean pad on in some areas (mostly where years of build-up has occurred).I have some laminate and I haven't tried the Cross Wave on that yet. But I'm pitching my regular mops.  I'm a very satisfied customer.",2
Amy,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have this and LOVE it. It works very well as both a ...,the United States,26-Feb-18,CrossWave,,"I have this and LOVE it. It works very well as both a vacuum and mop.I ran out of the cleaning product that came with it. So now I simply use Mr Clean diluted with water and honestly I like it better!Now, I will say, after every use I take it apart and clean it, which I guess in reality is taking up the time I saved by using this machine over the normal way of sweeping than mopping a floor. So I would say you don't save much time with this thing but on the positive, it is less strenuous than the normal way of sweeping then mopping.And secondly, make sure to always empty and clean out the dirty container as well as the brushes and make sure to allow it all time to air dry after each use because if not it will have a musty smell the next time you go to use it! (For those wondering, I don't empty out the Mr Crean/Water product each time, I just leave it in there.)I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel the ONE thing that could make this product better is if they would had used the sweeping/cleaning circular pad method seen on the SpinWave product with the vacuum effect seen on this product, instead of the straight line mopping brushes this was made with. I feel like it would had provided for a more deeper clean. So I am secretly hoping that will be this machine's next upgrade ;)",

Plus, I don't have to physically touch or wipe up any of the mess. This works well for hard floors and carpeting. There is no smell lurking afterwards either. My only complaint is that it a little more cumbersome to clean the appliance afterward. I find it easiest to dump everything in the toilet and ran water over the parts over the toilet. I know this is disgusting to think about, but it sure is quick and easy to clean up those disgusting wet/solid messes.",

Okay took it to a repairman that charged $50. Now it's dropping blobs of cleaning fluid AND dirty water.... this is not worth the hassle and money.",
Pacific NW,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DOES NOT WORK on area rugs, sinister design prevents returns! AVOID!",the United States,12-Aug-19,CrossWave,,"This overpriced pile of junk does NOT work on rugs or carpet. It simply locks up and can't be moved forward. Additionally, during assembly, once you slide the handle into its opening, it locks into place and can never be removed for re-boxing, even if you completely disassemble the unit. This was designed to prevent anyone from returning it.Never buying a Bissell product again.",

Now my CrossWave is not charging.  According to the troubleshooting guides on line, I need a new charging base and that is out of stock.  It works great, when it works.  I'm tired of the problems and wish I had never bought it.",
Lindsey H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on hard wood floors.,the United States,31-Aug-18,CrossWave,,I love this vacuum. I wanted something that vacuumed and washed the floor at the same time. I am busy and don’t have time to sweep and wash the floor multiple times a week. This does a great job. Some of the reviews said it doesn’t work great on carpet. I didn’t get it for that so I don’t use it on carpet. If there is water left behind I just go over it again with the vacuum and not the washing function. The only draw back is if there is something stuck on the floor I sometimes have to scrape it. The brush doesn’t get it off. It works best on hardwood floors.  Does just an ok job on my tile floors.  Overall I love it and recommend it.,

Hiba,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great dry and wet cleaner for hard floors,the United States,8-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"This is a good vacuum as per my needs. I needed a vacuum for my parents in India where there are marble floors and tiles, and cleaning and mopping is done frequently. Also we have odd area rugsProsOne important thing is that this vacuum can dry clean - Yes though it is advertised as clean and wash at the same time, it is a handy dry cleaner of hard floors.Now coming to its mopping - I purchased this in Sep from Bissell store and got a good 15% off deal, took it to India, and have used it on hard and rough floors with dust and debris and spills, and it has performed pretty well. It mops cleanly leaving a non-dirty mop streak behind it as advertised.Easy access points - The hard floor and area rug buttons on handle, are simple for my parents to operate. The water spray button is located on the underside of the hard floor button and it only sprays water till the time you hold it. Hence you can control the wet cleaning, or as I said just do dry  cleaning.DownsidesSolution consumption - Our hall area is around 350 sqft and it consumed one complete large fill solution in one cleaning. (around 1 oz of solution, rest water). I used the recommended Bissell crosswave solution.The thing that didnt work for me was though the self cleaning tray. The roller brush just didnt rotate and clean. I had to pull out the roller brush and clean it under tap water.Overall this vacuum relieved my parents of the manual brooming and cloth mopping and i am happy for that",

I still use my Dyson cordless over ...,the United States,9-Mar-17,CrossWave,,"If you have tile or porcelain floors, this is going to be your best friend!  I still use my Dyson cordless over my rugs, because you can't beat Dyson's suction for pet hair and kid debris.  My floors have truly never looked or felt cleaner.  As many other reviews have said, you won't believe how dirty the water gets...  I have quite a bit of square footage, so had to fill the clean water and empty the dirty water about 4x but I wanted to.  I felt at ease knowing that I wasn't pushing dirty water around on the floors...I would have given it 5 stars had the suction for the rugs been better.

I can now get mynah bird poops off the tiles by switching to the carpet mode and holding the cleaner in place for a few moments and then switching back to hard floor.  Learned you need to dispense cleaner almost continuously and it does a wonderful job!  Care for the unit is not a problem, but I'm a bit of  clean freak.

I opted for the $259 version that’s blue and came with 2 multi surface brushes, 1 wood floor brush and 2 bottles of cleaning solution. I was absolutely amazed how little time it took me to clean about 2000 sq feet of wood floors! I have 2 children and 3 dogs so my floor is absolutely disgusting most of the time. I’ve only been able to clean the floor on the weekends and it would take me hours to sweep, vacuum and then mop the floors... not anymore! 1 step process with the Crosswave.

Sanpete,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good power mop, fair dry vacuum; cleaning formula cost",the United States,23-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"This seems especially well-suited to a place without space for lots of cleaning equipment, and not much carpet.It's best on smooth surfaces, where it does a really nice job, comparable to using a manual wet mop, but with a lot less effort.For rugs and low-pile carpet it's pretty good for ordinary dry vacuuming, and helpful but no miracle for wet cleaning. I don't plan to use it much for the latter.The roller brush is powered, but there's no power drive--you provide the push and pull.-- Operates as wet mop with vacuum, or dry mop with vacuum, or dry vacuum.-- No filters or bags to replace, but does need simple cleaning after each use.-- Moves easily across smooth floors, requires more effort for rugs or carpet.-- Fairly light at 11.5 pounds (without water).-- Swivels smoothly at joint for easier steering.-- 4.4 Amps power, low by contemporary standards for a vacuum, but seems to be enough for this design.-- 3000-rpm brush roller.-- Average noise for a vacuum.-- Easy, intuitive controls.-- Markings on cleaning fluid container show easy-to-use fill marks.-- 25-foot cord.-- Very easy to assemble.-- 2-year limited repair-or-replace warranty-- Doesn't do edges.-- Doesn't accept attachments, so not for anything but floors.Cleaning solution costBissell recommends only Bissell's own brand of cleaning solutions be used with this ""to prevent internal component damage."" It takes 4 fluid ounces of the solution to clean 700 square feet of smooth floor or 350 square feet of rug or carpet. A sample of 8 ounces comes with the machine. 32-ounce refills can be had for $9.99 plus shipping from Bissell. There's free shipping for orders over $30 or $40 (the website gives both figures).That works out to about $1.80 per 1000 square feet of smooth floor, or $3.60 for 1000 square feet of rug or carpet, not counting any shipping.In addition to the multi-surface solution that comes in the sample, Bissell also offers at the same price a formula specifically for wood floors (sealed floors only--this machine isn't for unsealed wood), and a formula for rugs and low-pile carpets.Bissell also has concentrated versions that you can save about 12% with, but you have to adjust how you mix them with the water.The multi-purpose formula, which is the only one I've tried, claims to be Earth friendly and pet and family safe.Replacement roller brush costThe manual doesn't mention any need to replace the roller brush, but eventually performance will probably benefit from a new one. That's also $9.99 from Bissell.In addition to the multi-surface brush that comes with the machine, Bissell offers at the same price a wood-floor brush, and a bristle brush for rugs and carpet.A Bissell rep has suggested the bristle brush for rugs might also be used as a brush with scrubbing action for smooth floors.",15
J.S.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Suction is weak,the United States,5-Jun-19,CrossWave,,"I've had this for a couple of years now. Leaves streaks on hardwood floor. Rug and carpet performance is 1 star. My carpet is still soaking wet after ""Cleaning"". I go VERY slow to try to suck up the water and still have significant dirty water left over that leaves dirty footprints on my tile floor when walking from the carpet to tile. After the solution container is depleted from being full, the dirty reservoir picks up about 1/10th of the solution from the carpet. The rest stays on the carpet and I assume the dirty water just dries back to dirt in the carpet.",

I use weekly to clean our wood floors and, even with a dog and active family, it is awesome how much it gets up. At 8 months pregnant I also appreciate that it is one step - no more sweeping and then mopping. And clean up is super easy. All the parts come apart for rinsing and everything wipes down quickly.

James Baisden,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't Last Beyond 6 Months,the United States,2-Dec-19,CrossWave,,Ordered my first Crosswave in 2018. It worked like a charm...for about 6 months. I went to use it one day and the unit wouldn't turn on. I was sent a refurbished warranty replacement for that unit in May of 2019. I have used it almost daily since then. In fact yesterday I used it to clean the tile before having family over. I get home this evening from work and grab it to clean up pets water splatters from their bowl...same as the last one. It didn't turn on. The bad thing is I just ordered a Bissell Pro Heat 2X from Target for Cyber Monday. I just called and cancelled the order. I'm going back to Hoover. I've never had the durability issues with Hoover. Good luck to anyone that purchases a Crosswave. You'll love it if you only need to use it once a week!,
Doug Hibbard,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy transition from hard floor to rug,the United States,29-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"We've had all-in-one cleaners before and, to be honest, they've been more annoying that anything else. Although useful for both carpet and hard floors, the interchange was not super easy. So, we usually relegated the cleaner to one or the other.This one, though, breaks that mold!Here's what is great:- Easy transition from hard floors to area rugs.Just wait ten seconds to prime, and you're ready to go! No need to stop your work flow.- All tanks, brushes, and easily clogged parts are completely removable and easy to clean so your cleaner does not stay nasty.- A light comes on when you are spraying solution, so there's no accidental spraying.- Two fill lines on the tank mean that you only use what you need, rather than filling a tank only to waste water/solution.A few negatives:- It does leave rugs pretty damp on the rug setting, so I'm not sure the suction is powerful enough for the amount of water it expends.- If you hit a bump, it will change the setting, so be careful on uneven flooring.A couple of notes:1) We still vacuum and sweep first. This will not replace any current cleaners.2) This is not a true carpet cleaner. Not enough height settings. It's just for area or industrial rugs.For high traffic hard floors and for rugs that frequently don't get well cleaned, this ia a great multi-tasker.",8

Condor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Effective cleaning machine!,the United States,22-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"To be honest, I expected more of a gimmick than a serious tool.Boy, was I wrong!The Bissell Cross Wave is indeed a serious tool.  I tested it out on my kitchen floor  which has deep  grout grooves that tend to trap dirt.  A steamer has trouble getting at that trapped grime.  But not so the Bissell.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how clean the floor looked once it had dried which did not take long at all.  The dirty water was nasty with all he dog hair the vacuum part had sucked up.But cleaning the unitl is also easy.  For me, if it takes forever to remove and clean all parts and then have to watch over them like a hawk while they are taking their sweet time drying so that no part goes missing, then the effort is not worth it.  The Bissell Cross Wave excels at that again in that there are few parts that need cleaning after every use.  That makes this also a USER FRIENDLY tool.",9

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM,the United States,16-Jul-19,CrossWave,,It is very pricey and not reliable.  I only own this machine for two years. It has broken twice. First was the foot assembly. They can replace parts in there so I have to buy the whole foot assembly which costed me over hundred dollars. The second time is water pump which they told me also irreplaceable. I call the Bissell company the representative offer me 20% off to buy a new machine from them. I am not that stupid to spend more money to buy another machine for the same company who makes unreliable products. When I was in there service center the tech told me that I should never pay over  $100 for a vacuum.  You are really not getting more benefits than a $30 vacuum. The mechanism between $30 machine and $300 aren't  really that much different. I hope anyone reading this review could learn the mistake I have made. Sincerely.,
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,like I did with the FloorMate,the United States,11-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"We purchased ours from Bed Bath and Beyond but I am a fairly loyal Amazon customer so I wanted to write my review here. I have had multiple hard floor cleaning products (Bissell Symphony steam mop, Shark steam mop, 2 different Hoover FloorMate cleaners) and this exceeds them all. I have 5 kids, 5 cats, and 2 dogs. We track A LOT of dirt through the house (no carpet). This machine makes it so I don't have to sweep before I clean, like I did with the FloorMate. I have had it clog a bit when I pick up big things, like leaves, but it is easy to open it and clean it out. The other thing I like is that you take the cover off, take the roller brush out, and you can rinse all of it out. I am able to run clean water through and get clean water in the waste tank, which is good because pet hair got caught up in the FloorMate all the time and I would have to unscrew it to take it apart to clean. I also was frustrated with the FloorMate because it wasn't getting my grout clean. (I hate grout. Whoever invented it should be made to scrub it on their hands and knees for eternity.). This does get the grout clean. Everytime I use it it scrubs cleaner. The one bad thing is that is picks up like a vacuum and has the water, so the stuff in the tank is a gross mixture of those things. I have been dumping it outside or down the toilet, but not in the sink. It is lighter and easier to move on the floor than the Hoover too. It also uses less water to clean and the floor dry faster. I have found that when I have a gross spot, I turn the rug function on and more solution comes out and it cleans a bit faster. Very happy with this product. I am glad there is finally a real competitor to the Hoover.",

R. C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great idea but extremely flawed,the United States,25-Sep-17,CrossWave,,"All the flaws of a mop with a pitiful excuse of a vacuum. I have over 2600 sq. ft. of tile and wood floor and have a bracing mobility service dog who assists with balance and other activities of dailing living. The mop is not a problem in use although battery powered would reduce the dangers assiciated with a cord for mobility impaired people.  The problem is the same problem as using a regular mop, disposing of the disgusting waste water and like a mop that is never completely clean after the first use, the roller is never sanitized and really clean after first use either. It takes several refills to clean floor and the same amount of emptying of waste and recleaning container and roller. Although it takes longer to vacuum first and then use a steam mop, the pads are changed as they get soiled and laundered so they are much cleaner than hand cleaned roller. The water is not hot in the mop/vac and cleaning is dependent on chemicals which to be really effective in disinfecting should remain in place for a period of time per CDC on various virus, bacteria, and mold/fungus decontamination. The clean smell of chemicals is a strange concept. Clean does not have a smell if all contaminants are really removed contrary to advertising propaganda. Personal bias regarding dangers of chemicals aside, I would not recommend this mop; the time in cleaning machine and recleaning floor until rinse water clear is makes the task take up a large part of a day. A provlem for a mobility challenged person is the constant redoing of mop maintenance and repetitive motions puts stress on all limbs and back. The only thing that makes it minimally more effective than a plain mop is that the water container is lighter and smaller than a bucket. For me a trusty Dyson vacuum with a steam mop is more effective and less painful. If the use and smell of chemicals is comforting, the floor can be sprayed and then steam mop used.",3
Christine Stanley,2.0 out of 5 stars,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,the United States,18-Feb-18,CrossWave,,"I was fortunate enough to be in a focus group for this product before it was released for sale. I was so excited that finally someone came out with a product that vacuumed and washed floors at the same time. The price tag was not an issue. I have 3 small dogs that use a doggie dog into their own room with ceramic tile floor and constantly bring in dirt especially after a good rain. I am constantly cleaning it and knew the Crosswave would help the process. The first time I used it I was ready to throw it out the door. In order for it to work efficiently, you have to use it slowly. The suction for removing the water/cleaner off the floor is not strong enough to do a good job and I had to use a towel to finish wiping the floor, if not it still would be dirty. I frequently had to refill the solution tank and empty the dirty one. I am soooooooo disappointed in this product. In addition, it's difficult to find the cleaning solution at a store locally and have to buy it online. I now use it to spot clean and take up room in my utility closet. Now I'm not so happy with all the money I spent on this. It's not any better than the Swiffer WetJet and it cost a lot less. I HATE IT!!!",
Jenn,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far it works great,the United States,28-Jul-18,CrossWave,,Just got it and it works great.  Cleaned grout that had been dirty for years.

It doesn’t even make real contact with with hardwood and after the water dries, the same paw prints are still there as before.The cleaning, disassembling, and reassembling the vacuum is much more work then simply sweeping first. The vacuum misses so many pieces that I feel like I’m using this thing over and over again simply to justify buying it.This takes more time than a broom and mop, doesn’t make my carpets look clean like a regular shampooer does, and it takes longer.

I gave it a true torture test on Golden Retriever hair and dirty hardwood floors. I was extremely impressed with the amount of dirt and hair it picked up and hopefully my posted picture truly speaks 1,000 words about this product (it's almost embarrassing to show how much dirt was on my floor but also gratifying at the same time that I got it all up). It was easy to assemble but perhaps even more important it was easy to use and clean when I was finished. Everything that comes in contact with dirty water pops out with ease and can be rinsed out. This is a product I will be using at least once a week for sure. The wood floor formula had a nice not over powering lemon scent and left the floor almost ""squeaky"" clean.

Mingo Pingo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pushed the envelope but it didn't work.,the United States,30-Sep-17,,,"Was debating between this and a regular carpet cleaner.  Decided to try this because it was smaller and lighter than the regular one, and I could use it for frequent, quick cleanings.It did a great job on my vinyl flooring, but my kitchen is the only room with vinyl...and I already have an iRobot mopper for that, which does a great job with minimal effort on my part (fill with solution, attach the accessory to the mopper, turn it on and leave the room). The Crosswave also did a great job, but with a lot more effort (fill with solution, turn on, and push/pull it around the room) and a lot more noise.As for it replacing a regular carpet cleaner, it has less suction so any cleaning took a lot more time and effort.  However, they do state it’s for area rugs and not for regular carpet cleaning. Hoped it would work, but returning it for a Bissell Pro-X.  Decided I also needed the hose for cleaning stairs and upholstery.",
CourtJL,4.0 out of 5 stars,things I love about this vacuum,the United States,22-May-17,CrossWave,,"things I love about this vacuum: it vacuums and mops at the same time. So if your a super busy mom like me it does two jobs in one! I love how super easy it is to use. My kid can use it too! It's easy to clean and keep clean (all the parts and used water tank). If you clean it every time you use it but it doesn't add a ton of extra time to cleaning. It does and amazing job of cleaning dirty floors. Sticky, muddy, crumby, soggy cereal it works great for. It does not work good for big chunks of food and really stuck on stuff.Things I don't like about this vacuum: it doesn't have an attachment and it doesn't do well in hard to reach areas. So if you have super dusty dirty corners it's not gonna mop that up.",
Cassidy Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't suck but does suck,the United States,3-Nov-19,CrossWave,,"This broke within 2 months of purchase. I used it probably twice a week.

Reba,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed!,the United States,26-Apr-17,CrossWave,,"I was really excited to get this product as I had been using a vacuum for hardwood floors and then old school bucket with braided mop. I was tired of how long it took to do both. My whole house is hard wood floors. We have one dog and one cat. I am going back to the old way. I am not impressed with the amount of solution that comes out for mopping, it's barely anything! No matter how long you hold the button down! I don't think it works as well as the old mop does. And cleaning out the bin that has animal hair and dirt?! Gross.. if I didn't have animals and old dealt with the dirty water it wouldn't be so bad, but man... the amount of hair and dirt plus water is bad and the last thing I'm going to do is pour it down my sink or go outside with a hose. I don't have to deal with any of that the old way. The only reason I gave it two stars was because now I only use it for my area rugs as a vacuum... the hardwood vacuum I use before I mop is an old super light Boswell that I use everywhere really, but it doesn't work good on rugs. The crosswave does work good on area rugs to get all the embedded dog hair up, tho I don't use any solution so I don't have the wet hairy mess to clean up after. My old janitor braided mop works amazing and floors are way cleaner longer than this product!",

I called Bissell customer service, and the rep explained that the handle was not properly installed. He told me to remove the water tank and push an object such as a screwdriver into the circle above the white plate. I had my husband help with the removal as it was difficult to push and pull at the same time. We reinserted the handle until it clicked. It worked like a charm! The hard floor button works perfectly!

You have to make it worth your while to use - because you need to take it apart and clean it after use - and you have to store the unit plus 6 different pieces.  I was using it today to clean my hardwoods and it suddenly - and for no reason - quit working.  Very disappointed.

I like the fact you must disassemble it to clean all the parts afterwards because then i know each time i use it it will clean like a new machine.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell - you are SOOOOOO close on this one!!!,the United States,14-Apr-17,CrossWave,,"I REALLY wanted to love this vacuum...  when I first saw it and read the claims, I thought - this could seriously change my life.  There are some very good things about this vacuum - and if Bissell were to correct the issues, I'd spend twice the price of this vacuum and keep it forever.... ALAS - for the high price and performance shortfalls, it's just not worth it.  First off - the positive... the vacuum does a good job of vacuuming hard floors EXCEPT -- if you back over a crumb instead of going forward over it, it will just push it around... something on the backside of the vacuum is set too low or they don't have the suction area properly positioned - something... so that's a negative since its a headache and makes it take longer to clean your floors - although I will say I feel it has good suction moving forward - but you should be able to go forward or backward over mess and your machine pick it up.  SECOND - I do really like the scent of the cleaning product - but it doesn't work super well and is rather expensive (esp considering how fast you go through it)... it doesn't clean footprint smudges off the floor and isn't streak-free... it's better than some other products I've tried - but I want ""great"" not just ""better than a bad one.""  THIRD - THERE IS NO WAND!  No tool, whatever you wanna call it...  and you just really do HAVE to have one on your vacuum.  I didn't realize it before I bought this vacuum - and was really disappointed to get it all put together and find there were no attachments/wands/tools, etc.  So, you would have to use a 2nd vacuum in conjunction with this one - and ""ain't nobody got time fo dat.""  NEXT: it needs to be way WAAAYYYY easier to clean.  If I have to clean my vacuum every time I need to USE my vacuum - that does. not. make. my. life. easier.  It needs to come with two or three spin heads - and they need to be machine washable.  The interior design of the cup area where the dirty water goes is NASTY to clean and you really have to get your hands all in the yuckiness to clean it properly -- in fact, the entire vacuum area underneath the plastic cover you remove is grimy and disgusting and you have to clean all of that too - not just empty and rinse the cup.  OH!  One last thing - the cord needs to be MUCH longer.  Our house is 1600sf and I have to stop, unplug and find a closer outlet about 4 times while cleaning the house - and we have outlets everywhere.  SO - Bissell, you had a fantastic idea - FANTASTIC!  Very good suction...  AMAZING concept...  Potential to be life-changing... But it really needs these changes to come through on the beautiful hope that filled the heart of all of us housewives when we first saw the box :)  Change these things, and I'll never buy another vacuum for my whole life and I'll tell everyone I know about it :)",2

Kathryn Adams,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was super excited and really did my homework to decide on ...,the United States,16-Feb-17,CrossWave,,I was super excited and really did my homework to decide on buying this machine. I had a Hoover Floormate for 2 yrs - that started leaking water and it had surely done it's time... and was half the cost of this one.  Does it clean the floor YES - does it do amazing cleaning...uh no. I am no impressed $225 worth to say I am ecstatic about my decision.  I had all tile floors and use this for the new adult dog that pees on the floors.  I purchased the pet solution to put in the machine it just sort of leaves a film. I also have been cleaning the grout on my floor - so the tank definitely is coming up mega dirty.  I don't like that the tank isn't that big. It does maneuver  wonderfully due to being so light. if the machine rolls over the cord it gets sucked in and you have to turn it off  - I dunno I am annoyed that the cord can so easily get caught in the machine - I have owned it for 4 days and used it everyday for small areas.  This machine is just ok - maybe I am used to more water being left on the floor and than having it be sucked up to dry with my previous machine. It has 2 options - hard floors and carpets. I don't have any carpets so I don't know how well it works on them.,

M.E.,1.0 out of 5 stars,excellent machine for pushing around dirty water,the United States,27-Aug-18,CrossWave,,"1) the brush is not powerful enough to scrub out stubborn stains ie food dried on kitchen floor 2) brush does not get into tile grout as a machine with a spinning scrubber would 3) WORST POINT: the brush becomes dirty quickly; after it becomes dirty, then streaks are left across the floor.

It isn't very long, so you always have to plug it in different spots to do one floor.but because of the way it is placed, it is always in the way of trying to clean.

Diane S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Crosswave is better than the Hoover Floormate!,the United States,5-Apr-18,CrossWave,,"It really does vacuum up all the dog hair while washing the floor. It washes with a minimum amount of clean water only, so the drying time is cut down significantly. It is noisy, but less so than the Floormate. The dirty water is vacuumed to a separate tank . The head of the machine articulates so the job seems a little easier. The cord is long enough to eliminate changing the plug  location. I have not used it to wash rugs, so I cannot comment, but it does a good job on hard floors. Glad I made the purchase because cleaning time has been cut down .",One
Dauphne cook,3.0 out of 5 stars,I’m not giving up on it yet. !,the United States,3-Nov-17,CrossWave,,"My husband bought this for me and I was excited about it. So first I will say that I love the way it cleans both hard wood, tile floors and rugs. The problem with this machine for me is that the first week I used it the container that holds the cleaning solution broke at the top , the little screan came off so we called and waited 2 weeks for them to replace the canister. Then once I got the new canister it stopped releasing the solution to mop the floor so we called again and they told us to cut the cord off the cross wave and send it to them so they could send us a new machine so we did. Once we received the new machine I continued to clean and now the wheels keep falling off when I use it. The problem as I see it is they use cheap parts for this machine and for the price it shouldn’t have all these problems but like I said I do love this machine. It needs to be redesigned with better parts.",One

I will put my other vacuum in the garage permanently for car clean out day.With dogs I am constantly sweeping, vacuuming, then mopping. Now I just vacuum/mop all at once.

Doggy Den,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very very very disappointed,the United States,30-Jul-17,CrossWave,,"It should be negative stars.  I wanted this to work sooo bad I've now bought 4 of them . I think one on Amazon. 3 from Wal-Mart,  they all continue to suck up the water,  but they have ALL stopped putting down liquid.  I raise dogs. I have rolled vinyl wood looking floor in my entire house. I use my floor cleaner 5+times a day.  I have owned some type of wet floor vac cleaner since they were invented.  I thought this would be the best one yet.  And none of the devices last over 8 months when you use them as much as i do so i was prepared for it to break,  but these stop working in less than 2 weeks! I think if you only clean your floor once a week or less this might be the unit for you. But if you USE your device ALOT this is not the product for you.",One
Mimi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't put your swiffer away,the United States,17-Dec-17,CrossWave,,"I like this vacuum. I have found if you screw the lid on too tight, the solution won't draw out correctly.

I am investigating in more filters and rollers so I can keep cleaning while the used ones dry, since they have to sit for 24 hours to dry.",

cv,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it- pros/cons,the United States,4-Nov-17,CrossWave,,"Love this little vacuum.  I have texture tile (deep grooves) and this thing is amazing.  It even gets the grout clean.ProsCleans grout and texture tile - I use the rug seetting first and then use the hard surface setting  (my tile needs it because of the deep texture)It doesn't need pressure - for stubborn stains/ dirt (kid and a dog) I use the rug setting and pass a few times and it will be gone, then the hats surface setting (I like to be thorough)Cons - The dirty water reservoir is small so when it gets a little above midway you have to empty it or it will not suction anymore. This can be a little bothersome,  but nothing in life is perfect.Overall this had been the best purchased cite this kind of machine we have ever made.  Love it because I didn't have to handscrub again!!!",
David Fisk,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Streaky,the United States,6-Jun-21,CrossWave,,"The concept is great, execution is pretty poor.  It leaves streaks everywhere, especially if you use their cleaner.  A third party cleaner did much better, but still bad.",

I swept my hardwood floors with a broom (Just to see how much extra it would pick up) Holy crap did it ever pick up dirt.  It sucked everything out from between the cracks of the hardwood (they are old hardwood floors not new) and mopped the floors beautifully.  There was a good half inch of dirt at the bottom of the dirty water bin.  Lightweight,  easy to use,  easy to clean.  Powerful.  Literally the only negatives i have:  it's loud and I wish they would have made it a retractable cord.  Those are the only two negatives I have.",

Carmen Devine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life?,the United States,26-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"I was hopeful bet skeptical that I could really mop without sweeping first,  but this machine delivers in a big way!  I was cleaning my hardwood floors by sweeping or vacuuming and then using the bona spray mop device,  I  was OK with that,  but honestly the two step process turned in to just sweeping pretty often...  And I also felt like the microfiber pad on the Bona was really just an applicator pad which,  in effect,  spread dirt around.  As for actually mopping,  that happened approximately once in a blue moon.With the Crosswave my floors are scrubbed clean and dried in the amount of time it takes to just sweep.  There is the additional step of dumping the dirty water,  but this machine is designed well enough to make that no big deal at all.Things I like:Light weightComponents are easy to disassemble and reassembleNice accessory optionsHuge time-saverStorage tray so you don't have to worry about dampness seeping out when it's not in useThings that could be better:The multi surface cleaner left a bit of residu, I am planning to use vinegar on the vinyl and the wood formula for wood in the futureThe filter is supposed to dry out for 24 hours after use before being put back in the machine,  I think there should be a special place for it on the storage tray...Things I disliked :NadaExcept all the time I spent (wasted) doing a mediocre job cleaning my floors:(This is a brilliant machine,  the Bissell engineers should be very proud of designing a superb,  useful time and energy saving device,  kudos!",10

Portrait of Innocence,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Effective, but not perfect",the United States,24-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"Out of the box, like many products, some assembly is required.  The directions are easy to follow, with much of it being intuitive.  Just don't forget to press the little black button on the handle as your are inserting it into the slot.  It took less time to assemble the unit than it took to un-box it.Fully assembled, it is lightweight and does not take up much real estate.  Bissell was thoughtful enough to mark the clean water tank with cleanser/water lines to ensure proper cleaner to water mix for their brand cleaner, (an 8ounce bottle is included).  These line markings may not meet the same recommended ratios for other floor cleaner brands.Hardfloor:I first used the machine on my kitchen floors.  It was nice not having to drag out the mop and bucket, yet alone the arduous process of filling and emptying said bucket. I found that the water recovery was fairly decent allowing the floor to dry quickly.  While it performed well overall, I did notice that it did little to nothing to removing sticky debris.  Those areas still had to be pre-treated and scrubbed by hand.Rug:One day later... The wool rug.  My rug is dense, with pile in the neighborhood of 5/16ths of an inch.  Pushing and pulling the machine across the rug was a chore.  As the ""push"" is slow and takes a great deal of effort, I only released the cleaner solution on the pull, to ensure that I did not over saturate the rug with solution.  I found that the water recovery was less than desired even with multiple dry passes.The rug was still slightly damp some thirty minutes after cleaning.  For the effort, I could not see a remarkable difference between the area of the rug that benefited from the solution  and that that only received the dry carpet.Carpet:Though the unit is not marketed for carpet cleaning, I wondered if the artificial fibers of my less dense carpet would meet with better results than the wool rug.  It did not.  If anything, I got a full body workout with very little results.  Don't buy this unit for deep carpet cleaning.  It would however work to quickly remove recent wet spills.What I liked:Convenient hard floor cleaning.I cleaned the kitchen and living room floor in less time than it normally takes to clean a fourth of the floor space.Though not instantly dry, the floors were ready for foot traffic within ten minutes of the last pass of the solution.Used far less water than traditional mopping.Easy to clean and reassemble after use.Picks up loose debris as a vacuum on both hardflooring and carpet like a charm.Wet passes did not destroy the pile of the rug/carpet.Did not scare the cat. Not having to corral a cat or worse clean up behind a terrified cat makes cleaning almost pleasant.What I did not like:It is loud, (but still didn't scare the cat, so this isn't the worst thing in the world).Exertion to results ratio did not pay out on the rug.  Perhaps my rug was more of a challenge than the machine was designed to handle.In the end, I'd recommend this unit for those with hardflooring.  The machine is easy to use and very efficient on hardflooring.The unit comes with the Multi-Surface Brush.  I will buy the Wood-Floor Brush as a second brush head as well as an easy way to apply liquid wax to the floors.",9

Or maybe you could put in the bathtub show if you life in an upstairs apartment because the dirty water is pulled up thru little openings, which becomes filled with muc, and around the mop/brush  roller.  That roller gets hair it picks up tightly would around it that has to be cut/or pulled out.  If you don't then the bursh/mop leaves streaks.

Trevor Goodchild,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty neat,the United States,24-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"Overall, this is a pretty neat little clean machine. It can vacuum, mop, and clean rugs, simultaneously. It won’t replace your wet mop, but it can do 90% of its job. Let’s compare it to traditional cleaning equipment, pros and cons style. To turn it on, you press the button for hard floor or rug. To turn it off, press the same button again. To dispense fluid, hold the trigger inside the handle. Release trigger and pass again to nearly dry a hard floor.Pros:-Uses a lot less elbow grease than a traditional wet mop.-It is lightweight; my pregnant wife can easily carry it from room to room.-It has two handles, one to use it by and the other to carry it by, which is placed lower so you don’t have to hold your elbow up in an awkward position to carry it.-Can vacuum and mop at the same time, saving time and energy.-It comes with a little hard plastic base to sit on when not in use, which you can fill with water and run it in for a minute to clean the brush (clever!).-It has a float in the dirty water compartment, so it will not overflow even if you clean the brush in the little base often. Cons:-Like a traditional vacuum cleaner, it doesn’t go all the way to the edges. You will still need to sweep and mop in these areas.-Unlike a traditional vacuum cleaner, you need to clean it after EVERY use. This is not, however, particularly difficult. It takes about 10 minutes to clean, then the parts have to be left to dry. Drying can take some time, especially for the filter and the roller and you cannot reassemble it until they are dry.-It doesn’t clean *quite* as well as your wet mop (but pretty close), so you will still need to wet mop your floors once in a blue moon.",8

One of the main things I like is that it picks up little pieces that the vacuum would normally spit out the back.  It does a good job cleaning the tile and is easy to use.  The real zinger is I had a whole bowl of red claim chowder fall on my carpet (tomato sauce, claims, garlic, onion, etc.)  While I know it is not intended for this purpose, it picked up most of it (along with a little elbow grease).  It is lightweight which is good for going upstairs but also makes it a little unstable when it is standing on its own.",

Excuse any typos, im doing this on a phone.So my mom bought this from the bissell website because she wanted all the extra attachments. She hates having dirty floors and for some reason ours are always dirty. The first time she used it she said it wasnt worth the cost. It always misses about a cm gap on the wall, it doesnt go all the way to the wall and it has a hard time sucking up leaves even though the commercial ahowed it sucking up an egg.I just finished using it for the first time and here are my complaints (some are small things, but for almost $300...i mean come on!)I am constantly shutting it off when trying to clean because the power button is right on the handle.It really did have a hard time going over the leaves.I HATE mopping and thought this would save time, but i couldve swept and mopped in the time it took me to do 1 1/2 rooms. I was using this for over an hour on 3 rooms and 1 small bathroom.You have to go over 1 spot like 5 times because not enough water comes out...and because its constantly shutting off because of the power button placement.You have to thoroughly clean after every single use.So back to this egg thing. If i dropped an egg would i suck it up with the vacuum? No. Onve again i would have to clean out the whole thing for one egg.  I would just get a paper towel and clean up the egg and be done instead of putting the cleaning solution and water in the vacuum, hauling it over, and going over it 50 times to make sure its clean.That being said, if you want to try it, im pretty sure you can get your money back if you dont like it.",3

Mud that multiplies more than a basket of bunnies caked my floors to the point that I thought maybe pulling up the wood floors and replacing with fill dirt would probably be easier until I hauled out my new Crosswave.

My floors were pretty dirty so I was looking forward to see how well this vacuum would perform. I was so disappointed.

Maker Default,2.0 out of 5 stars,A mixed bag of usefulness,the United States,8-Apr-18,CrossWave,,"What I liked about the unit: easy to use, great concept and it does wet the floor and suck up liquid so drying time is less. What I didn’t like: didn’t clean better than a wet mop, the solution liquid is fairly toxic (made me cough, turned my skin red just by breathing the fumes and gave a bad headache) and did not work well on textured tile (Mexican tiles or “rough” tile). Though I followed the simple instructions, the solution left a tacky residue so I had to wet mop the floor again and hand dry. I used a two bucket method and could tell dirt and oily soapy was left behind after using the unit. The manufacturer states you can only use their liquid solution so I am stuck with essentially a mop with the ability to vacuum water up. I tried on my hardwood floors as well (no solution) and pre sprayed with a mixture of vinegar and mild soap. Worked as well as a mop. May work for folks that have smooth floors, don’t have pets or kids (which are messy) and are not impacted by the toxic liquid solution.",
Crissey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this machine! Saves time and does a great job in a multi-pet household,the United States,17-Oct-16,CrossWave,,We have cats and dogs and wanted a 2-in-1 machine. We had a new Hoover Floormate and it just wasn't working for us to vacuum and then clean the floors. The Hoover Floormate was heavy too. The Crosswave gets the floor very clean and vacuums at the same time. It has saved me so much time. Our home is completely tile so it has been a lifesaver. It is very light weight. The best feature is you can take it apart and clean it after use - even the brush! The cleaning solution works great - no streaking and it smells really good.

When you take it apart to see what the clog is, what do you find?  NOTHING!  It just seemingly goes into this mode where it craps out.  Putting it on carpet is a joke, it doesn't have enough power to remove a dirt stain.  We know because we tried it multiple times, and bought that expensive cleaner.  The only thing that Bissell has ever made that I will stand behind is The Big Green Machine, but the Crosswave is a big piece of junk, and for the pricetag it's a big waste of money.  After what I know about it now, I wouldn't pay $20 for it.  Seriously, it's a headache!

In the time it took her to ratio out the soap and water in the reservoir, assemble the clumsily-designed attachments, and begin the extremely tedious task of: 1. place on spot on dirty floor 2. spray 3. scrub 4. hover over spot and wait for drying 5. repeat on next spot, I had used a broom and mop and finished my half of the house. Just stick with the classics and save time and money. Bonus product fact: The brand sells proprietary soaps just for this mop making it the IPhone 5 charging cable of the cleaning supply world.",One

You must pick up the cord from the bottom of the machine and do the cord dance unless you want it to get wrapped up in the cleaning head.

I have cats so have lots of litter on the floor and the yucky mess it makes aka cement, is pretty amazing.  I have tried all the latest hard wood floor cleaning machines on the market and have never found what I am looking for except the Hoover Hard Wood Floor Cleaner.

Which tells me this machine was picking up dirt with every spin, and completely rinsing and squeegeeing the microfiber roller, then coming back for more with a clean, damp roller...several times a second.  I also used it on a big area rug that I had just vacuumed with a conventional vacuum cleaner.  It LOOKED very clean, but the Bissell waste receptacle was full of pet fur and dust!

Marla,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh.. Not for pet hair,the United States,28-Dec-16,CrossWave,,"Like most I wanted to love this product. I got the crosswave for Christmas and I  immediately started to put it to work. I vacuumed first, because my black lab sheds terribly. The cleaning solution it come with will add up very fast. You only get about four uses out of the whole bottle. that is a negative for me (leaving the cleaning solution on the counter is a joke it leaks all over the place $$)This machine is a very slow clean. if there is something like coffee spills that is dryed to the floor, you have to go over the spot slowly and sometimes multiple time to get it clean. It took me about 1.5hr to do my whole house, which is 1100sf. In my master bedroom I really put it to the test. I did not vacuum first. About halfway threw I had to take the machine to the cleaning dock to run water over the brush to get all the hair out if the roller compartment. This thing is not made for pet hair at all. To clean my whole house I probably have to put it on the cleaning dock about 4-5 times. In my living room I have hard wood floors( really old) this machine soaked them and didn't really pick up a whole lot of water. One of the positives I have to say for this is that it did seem to refresh my area rug really well and got the raw hide off from my dog. I am defiantly going to miss it for that. About two days after getting the crosswave my co worker told me that she just bought the symphony. I asked to borrow it because I was not totally sure about the crosswave. So after using the symphony in my kitchen the pad was really dark brown! 😖 Needless to say I don't think the crosswave cleans very well. I returned the crosswave (250$)and bought the symphony pet(140$). Much happier with my choice and I saved money!",

He had no trouble and was very proud. I filled the reservoir with water and cleaner and off I went. This sucked up dirt, leaves, dust, crumbs, etc, without hesitation. Then it sprayed and mopped right along with it!! So awesome! Clean up is a breeze, simply pull out the cup in the front, dump the dirty grimy water, rinse, and let air dry. Quick, easy, simple, painless. What is an added cool bonus is that you can see just how dirty your floors were when you dump the water!! Nasty...yet satisfying because you know that the Bissell really does work and works awesomely! This also works great on rugs. It does pull a bit harder over the rugs, but not horribly so. Love this machine!! A bottle of the cleaner does come with the Cross Wave, however I think that you can also use the cleaner of your choice as well.I HIGHLY recommend the Bissell Cross Wave!

Richard,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not the end-all be-all to sweeping as I'd hoped it would be, but does the job. Knocked off an extra star for testing on animals.",the United States,25-May-17,CrossWave,,"I held off buying this thing for a couple months simply because of the price tag, but living in an all tile home with two dogs and a cat drove me crazy enough to impulse buy this at Target. (If you have a Target Credit Card you can get 10% off with financing, so I actually ended up paying 234 for the BISSELL itself + an extra bottle of all purpose cleaner so I'd recommend that if you have the means.)After using this for a couple months I think I've gotten the full experience of what this thing is capable of. Basically, if you have kids that spill stuff all the time, this is probably best for you. I've seen it advertised on infomercials picking up spilled food, juices, etc. and I will say it works REALLY well for situations like that. But I don't have kids, just a few pets that shed like crazy, and the most I use it for in that aspect is if its raining and they've managed to track in a lot of mud, or if my cat decided to make a mess with his wet food. Even then I use it mostly as a general weekly clean up from the stuff that I track in over a week as well. So if you use it consistently it does a pretty good job of keeping your floors clean. If you don't though, you'll always be emptying a ridiculously dirty water filter that'll make you feel disgusting for even having floors that dirty in the first place.Getting into the cons, the main reason I bought this is because of the fact that it vacuums and mops at the same time, which I'm sure is the reason most people bought it as well. I have a terrible back somehow at age 18, so mopping an entire house of tile is ridiculous and takes FOREVER, and never manages to make the floors feel clean anyways. I've found though, that if you have say a mud room that's collected a lot of loose dirt, not mud, you're better off sweeping most of it and then using the BISSELL for the little bit that never gets in the pan anyways. If you leave it all to the BISSELL to pick up, it'll do it, but you'll wish you hadn't when you're cleaning it out 10 minutes later. The cleaning/emptying process isn't really that time consuming, but I'll just say I don't look forward to it afterwards.The other thing big thing about this product that bugs me is the fact that it isn't battery powered. For the price, this should ABSOLUTELY be wireless, especially since this is also advertised to clean large areas of your home. The cord itself isn't long at all, and I find myself unplugging and plugging it back in at least 5 or 6 times to go through the whole house, and I only have a 2 bed 1 bath place. I can't imagine what it'd be like in a larger home. Also, this thing absolutely EATS cords. With most vacuums I've used, I can run over the vacuum's cord itself and get away with it with no problem. But with this thing, because of the spinning brush I imagine, if you run over the BISSELLS cord it gets sucked in there and tangled up in the brush. It's not that hard to get out if you turn it off immediately to get it out, but at the very least this should have a retractable cord.I knocked off a single star for the aforementioned cons, but after reading that BISSELL tests on animals I went ahead and knocked another off. If I could return this thing I would after reading that, but it's past the 30 days for me. Seriously, not to be all hippie-dippy, but testing on animals is absolutely unnecessary in this day and age, and always has been. BISSELL as a company needs to make that change, because I know plenty of people that would have never bought this based on that fact alone.",One

The Bissell does a great job.It also squirts the cleaning solution onto the rollers, as far as I can tell, not on the floor, so there aren't pools of water.  As a result, the floor dries faster with the Bissell.  That's a big plus for me.  It has a smaller profile than the Hoover so it gets into tighter spots, and it will clean rugs, though you need to vacuum them before you wash.  On hard floors the unit vacuums and washes all at once!  How much simpler could it be?Everything about the Bissell makes it easy to use, and it even comes with a pan on which to place the unit once you're finished.  So no sitting on your floor dripping.  The instructions are clear and concise.  Honestly, you couldn't ask for more.But wait, there IS more!  It's also lighter and easier to maneuver than the Hoover, which is important for a lot of us (ahem) older people.  Really, it's an across-the-boards winner, in my opinion.",3

Jay,3.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelming on both dry and wet cleaning.,the United States,20-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"My home is all tile floors so hard floor performance was all that I tested with this device.  My previous cleaner was a Hoover Floormate which I still find performs better than this Bissell Cross Wave.  The Bissell is a better dry vacuum than the Hoover but I think anyone looking at buying this device is more interested in the wet cleaning performance.  Here the Bissell falls behind the Hoover.  The brush on the Bissell is a softer paint roller style brush which works well for dry vacuuming, doesn't ""scrub"" hard enough to clean dirty tile, nor does it do anything to clean the (always dirty) grout.  The Hoover has stiffer circulating brushes which scrub tile much better.  The ability to pick up the water is also superior on the Hoover.  The Bissell feels more like a mop that is rolling/soaking up the dirty water rather than vacuuming it up like the Hoover does.  The Bissell's roller becomes much more full of hair and debris than the Hoover or even a regular vacuum too.  In general I think the best solution is to buy a good dry vacuum and then buy the Hoover Floormate for the hard floor cleaning.  These hybrid attempts end up sacrificing performance on both dry and wet cleaning in the name of convenience but if the results are underwhelming then there was nothing convenient about it in the end.",38

AshertopiA,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good w/ Room to Grow,the United States,12-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"I've had an opportunity to try several upright mops and hard wood cleaners over the years so I feel pretty confident when I say I know what I like. This has some great features, but there are some things I really don't like.PROS+Putting this together and cleaning up is really easy. I like how the brush comes out and you can get into all the important (and dirty) places to clean.+Cleaning is easy and the floor looks incredible. (Just like most of the hard wood/floor cleaners I've used.)+Other than costs (see below) I like that there are other options for rollers. Mostly, I like that I can get a new roller really easily if mine is used up, too worn, etc.+It's a small, light weight cleaner that is much less bulky than many others I've used. Very streamlined.CONS-I pour the dirty water from my normal mop out. With chunks of stuff this is a must. I use my yard and dump by the wild bushes. If you live in an apartment or don't have a yard I'm not sure what you'll do. The food and hair may clog toilets and the liquid doesn't go well in your trash.-I don't like the cost of supplies for this. It says it works on rugs but then you can buy a different roller for about $20. (There are three rollers that I see for sale). The cleaning fluid goes quickly in this and Bissell's brand for this cleaner currently goes for about $20 for 32 ounces. I think with regular usage - maybe twice a month - you'll run through maybe a bottle of that per month or so if you have a lot of hard floors like I do (about 1000 sq ft) with high traffic.-I am not a fan of using this on rugs or carpet (I know it's not for carpet,) because I don't feel that it sucks up water well enough to get your rugs wet. On floors it takes a second pass to get most of the water. On rugs, that's harder. Maybe I put too much solution on it. I know I did push the button on accident a lot.-Indicators for out of fluid and full tank weren't clear to me. Maybe I didn't hear or see. I used visual inspection.-The price is, in my opinion, high for this. After trying some very expensive (Shark, for instance) and very inexpensive (Dirt Devil, for instance) hard floor cleaners I settled on a $150 Hoover that I really like.  This is $100 more than that at the time of this review and I don't know that it's worth that to me. Just my opinion.Overall, I like this cleaner but I think there are opportunities for improvement.",One

I had to revisit some sections of the floor multiple times.-  Mop brush/pad does not extend all the way to the front and side edges of the cleaning head which made cleaning edges and corners of the floor difficult.-  Cleaning up the mopping apartus after finishing mopping is a big undertaking, involves a lot of dismantling and rinsing/washing-  Pet hair was stuck in the mop head from switching from the vacuum function to the mop function, I think this product would likely work better for homes without shedding pets-  The vacuum and mop functions were a little noisy while running compared to most other vacuums I've used.",4

Buffy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exceeded my expectations, great all in one.",the United States,18-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"I have tried a lot of gadget style cleaning devices and so many have been a little disappointing in how well they clean and messy clean up from cleaning up. Not the case with this great Bissell all in one. It really seems to be cleaning up a ton of dirt. I can the dirt come up in the dirty water section. Love that the dirty water is completely separate from the clean water, makes so much more sense than my old mopping method of dunking a dirty mop back into a bucket of water and cleaner.It has the option for hardwood floor and rugs. I tried them both and each was equally pleasing. I use the mult-purpose cleaner instead of a separate cleaner for the hardwood and it seemed to work very well so I'll stick with it. Would be a little more work to change the cleaner from hardwood to rug cleaner when tackling the rounds.After you have cleaned your floors and rug you need to disassemble all of the parts and rinse and clean them. It's takes a little more effort than I would like but it's worth it for the clean results and to keep everything fresh for the next time.The piece itself it a little bit bigger and heavier than I had hoped it would be, which makes for a little bit of a challenge living in a New York apartment but I'll find the space somewhere.All and all I'm very pleased.",4
S Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,EASY!,the United States,14-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"Easy to put together, instructions are clears and simple.  It's very light and easy to manage, the controls are simple and accessible, and you can get into and under almost anything - so not as much furniture to move.  Even for someone with limited mobility, it's light enough to use without aggravating my arthritis, but still does an excellent job on the floor - much better than our old Floormate.It cleans very well, and more important, after use, it's easy to clean up and put away.  One reason we never used our Floormate much was because it was such a chore to keep clean, but this dismantles easily, rinses out, and goes right back together.  The means I'll use it more often, and my floors will stay cleaner.This works very well on tile and vinyl - we didn't use it on hardwood yet.The cord could be a little bit longer, but it's not really a problem, just an annoyance.",6

Gcat,4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective with limitations,the United States,22-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"I used this Bissell to clean my epoxy garage floor and it worked pretty well. It was able to clean off small mud spots and water stains. However, it took a lot longer to clean than just using a swiffer. Cleaning rugs and carpets was less effective.PROS-Very lightweight and compact-Intuitively easy to use with helpful markings everywhere. The fluid container has marks showing exactly how much water and solution to add.  To disassemble for cleaning, there are arrows in all locations telling you how to take it apart. You likely will not need to read the manual more than once. Bissell did a thoughtful, excellent job here.-I was concerned that cleaning would be a chore given that this is combination mop/vacuum but it's actually fairly easy. You just take off the parts and rinse under water.CONS-Suction power is weak compared to most vacuums. Works reasonably well on hard floors but will struggle with deep carpet. Don't expect this to suck all the water out of a carpet or rug.-The cleaning width is small which means it is best reserved for smaller areas. Otherwise, your arm will get worn out pulling it back and forth. Because you are mopping in addition to vacuuming, you need many more runs over an area than a typical vacuum.OVERALLThis is a unique product that combines a light-duty mop and vacuum. It has limitations in suction power and cleaning width. For small-area, hardwood floors, it is a product that works well. For large areas or carpets, the limitations become apparent.",3

WISHFUL THINKING,1.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE The Bissell Cross Wave!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not so much anymore,the United States,26-Jul-16,CrossWave,,"Wow!!! I am loving the Bissell 1785A Cross Wave All-in-One floor cleaner. First of all easy to assemble. Just insert handle and water bottle. I actually read the directions (not something I usually do). I added the proper amount of solution to the warm water. It is marked on the bottle. The floor cleaner just glides over the floor. Held the solution button and cleaned kitchen, hallway, living room and dining room. The vacuum picks up all the dog hair and dust nicely. I just vacuumed and steamed this morning but to my surprise the floors were still a little dirty as there was dirty water  in the dirty water tank. This floor cleaner also made  my grout look pretty good too. I am sort of a fanatic about clean shiny floors and this is fantastic. Love love love thie Bissell Cross Wave!!!!!!Update: I have now replaced the Bissell Crosswave five times. Bissell is very kind on sending replacements but now the fifth one has had the engine burn up.  I do believe there is a flaw in the crosswave. As much as I loved using the Crosswave they keep breaking down. UPdate: I do have to say Bissell has excellent customer service and they do replace under warranty.Update: Bissell is no longer replacing the unit after SIX Crosswaves have failed on me. I will never buy one again!!!",2
DJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent multi-use Rug and Floor Cleaner,the United States,7-Aug-16,CrossWave,,"Excellent for light to medium duty use on area rugs and hardwood floors.  Assembly and use instructions were clear and concise in large print booklet unlike many manuals in ChingEnglish with print smaller than a dustmote.  Assembly was easy and took about five minutes.  The machine itself is lightweight and very manueverable with its swivel brush head.  Cleaning up all the dirty parts is also easy.  Bissell did their homework on this unit.  Most of the negative comments seem to be nitpicks or reviews against commercial grade floor cleaning machines.  It just works and works well!  It's compact enough to store just about anywhere.All the parts which hold cleaning solutions and collect dirty water are easy to install/remove and have watertight gaskets.  We had a similar Dirt Devil unit that leaked after a week of use.  The cleaning solution container has clear markings for water and solution levels.  The brushhead unit is easy to open and the cleaning brush is easy to remove, clean, and replace.  You receive a big tray which holds the unit and brushes for cleaning and drying.  Separate controls to start the brush and dispense solution are clearly marked, are lit, and easy to reach during use.  When solution is being dispensed a big LED on the brush unit lights up so you know this function is in use.We cleaned hardwood floors and area rugs with excellent results using the multi-surface solution provided with the unit.  This is a real plus if you have rooms with a mix of area rugs and floors.  Before this we had to clean these separately in a time consuming process.  Floors looked very clean after use and the amount of dirt and hair picked up from rugs (professionally cleaned a few months ago) was impressive.  Rugs looked visibly better.  You can expect to fill the solution container a couple of times for large areas but that's the price of having an easy to manuever compact cleaning machine.Overall, we are very impressed with everything about this compact rug and floor cleaner.  From excellent packaging to clear concise instructions to ease of use this little machine performs extremely well.  I wouldn't use it to clean a house full of wall-to-wall carpeting but that's not its intended purpose.  Highly recommended!",One

It allows you with the touch of a button to switch from cleaning hard floors to washing your area rugs and vaccuming. All with one machine. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical  with this cleaner. The thought of being able to mop my kitchen floors, vaccum and clean my area rug, and clean my hardwood floors? I started on my hardwood floors first and I was amazed at the amount of dirt that came from the floors, floors that appeared to have no dirt on them. My kids walk on the floors barefoot or in white socks. It passed the white sock test!Next, I used the Bissell on my area rug in my living room, again, I was amazed at the amount of dirt it sucked up and my area rug looks almost new and that says a lot since I've had it for a few years.  This machine works great and I can't wait to try it on my bathroom and kitchen floors. Set-up was easy and it comes with a 8 fl oz bottle of cleaner to get you started.

This is not a vacumme cleaner, although the makers say you don't need to vacumme first. It is mainly for solid floor surfaces, but has a rug setting too. I have no rugs, so only used it on my pine wood floors. The machine has a mopping type rolling thing on the bottom, that scrubs the floor with water mixed with cleaning solution. A small bottle of the solution comes with the machine. Dirty water goes into a second compartment. The machine work worked quite well. It isn't very loud, and my floor looks so much better than when I mop it. Best of all, it is so much easier and less messy to use than a mop and bucket! I had a couple of things that might be nice, but not necessary. One is if the cord would retract into the machine instead of having to be managed with one hand.

Vanessa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deserves a Nobel Peace Prize,the United States,12-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This machine is the best invention since air conditioning. I use it every day. Yes. Every day. I actually owned the old bissell version of this concept and it leaked bad so I hesitated to buy this. Well this is nothing like that piece of crap! This is solid gold, 5 outta 5 stars, highly recommend, give it a freaking award. I also realized i shed like a husky. So much hair. Anyway, this is the bomb dot com. No more separate vacuuming and mopping… no more swiffer. This is all you need. I can even use it to clean the gym mats in my home gym. I use to have to take them out individually and rinse/wash them… days of that slave labor are over!!! This baby somehow cleans my gym mats without sucking them up. It’s a freaking miracle I tell ya. If I could give it a billion stars I would. Thank you Bissell for bringing me the love of my life. I am so happy and complete now.",2
Tiffers1110,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely amazing vacuum if you have young children!!,the United States,2-Oct-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This was the best thing i ever purchased as a mom. I used to spend hours each week sweeping, vaccuming and mopping my floor and they still never stayed clean! Now every night after dinner i use this and it picks up all the food, hair, crumbs and dirt that my 3 kids (all under 5) track all over my house daily. I have used this to suck up pieces of pork chops, corn, rice and all kinds of food that cant be swept! I love that i can use the water to mop or just use it as a regular vaccuum and i love how easily it transitions from my hard floors to my area rugs. When using the water feature, even on the rugs, it releases just the right amount of water and dries quickly.The directions recommend cleaning after every use and it is a little time consuming taking it apart to clean. I use it 2 or 3 times before dumping and cleaning it honestly and havent noticed any issues with it not working well by the 2nd or 3rd use. Still has the same great suction as it does when freshly cleaned. I also purchased my own floor cleaner to use because the recommended cleaner didnt have that ""just cleaned"" smell i prefer and it still works great!If you are one who needs every crack and crevace cleaned daily you may still need to use a broom to get into corners or along the baseboards because its a little big and doesnt get into tight spaces well.I would recommend purchasing the upgraded roller (used for pet hair and comes with the upgraded and more expensive vacuum) instead of the basic one that comes with this. I read lots of reviews saying this same thing but decided not to buy it when i purchased the vacuum and now i regret that decision. My daughter and I shed long hairs from our head and they do get tangled easily around the roller. When i clean it i have to use scissors to cut the hair off. I plan to purchase the upgraded roller eventually.All in all i am extremely satisfied with this and feel the price is absolutely justified and worth it. I did take a video showing my vaccuming rice but cant find it on my phone at the time of this review. I will update when i record a new video.",One
Sarah Turner,5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT if you have Pets - But might be worth upgrading to the pet version!,the United States,10-May-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE my crosswave!  It has been saving my sanity with a new LARGE puppy.  I have a ~ 6 month Bernedoodle, and he is still in the process of potty training.  I also have a German Sheppard who sheds like crazy!  So keeping my brand new Luxury Vinyl Planks Clean has been a disaster (They are a darker Grey and show every ounce of dirt& dust.  Plus just moping when your puppy likes to walk when he has an accident was causing me to use SO MUCH of my day cleaning up messes/cleaning my floor.The fact that the Crosswave mops and vacuums all at once has been a MASSIVE life saver - I also work form home, so I needed clean ups to be quick when the pup doesn't make it quite outside to the bathroom.  It is SUPER easy to clean, and I haven't had any issues with it scratching my floors (as other users have stated it did to theirs).  I use the solution that it came with, because I find it cleans better than just vinegar & water (plus I kind of HATE the smell of vinegar).  I tried just soapy water (as that what LVP usually recommends)  But it would leave soap streaks on my floor.  Plus, I found that the vinegar & water solution didn't spray as well as the solution it came with.The ONE draw back to it is that it has at least an inch from the side of the cleaner that doesn't get cleaned (So getting messes up against a wall/floor board, means you have to turn the cleaner against the grain of the wood, which I find doesn't get it as clean & shiny.The difference between the pet version and this version is the pet version has a brush that doesn't tangle as easily (I haven't had any issues with the brush on this model.) And Also That it comes with a strainer.  The strainer would be the ONE Thing I wish I had, but instead, I just bought a cheap strainer, and strain the dirty water through that.  I don't think it's worth the extra $80 dollars to get the next up model.  But I'm sure the strainer would be handy!I also have used this on my extremely thick red (80s-90s) carpet in my bedroom.  Most vacuums themselves have a hard time cleaning up the carpet, but this does a wonderful job.  I do think its a bit harder to pick up all the hair, but it does the job.  I'm not sure how well it actually cleans the carpet though, so I would invest in a carpet cleaner if most of your house is carpet.  It works decently on THICKER rugs, but way better on thinner rugs.  (I think there is too much suction for the times I've tried to use it on my bathroom rugs.)It's super easy to clean as all of the parts detach very easily.  Plus I love the stand it comes with that allows you to clean the brush after each use!Seriously one of the best investments I've made for my floors.",
kris-tina a.wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW! Very impressive results and fun to see!,the United States,7-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"WOW, this is going to change my life! Took less than 5 minutes to unpack and assemble (no tools required). Nice long electrical cord, light weight,  easily maneuverable. It was fun to use,  once I got over my disbelief that I could vacuum up wet or dry debris on the floor and wash at the same time. What little moisture that was left evaporated in about a minute.  I had concerns that it would clean up to baseboards,  but it did. My apartment has sealed wood floors and white tile/grout in bathroom and kitchen.  The grout is recessed a bit,  but it wasn't a problem with this machine.  My cat's bowls are set on top of a tray,  but she still manages to get food on the  floor.  No worries with this machine,  everything cleaned up beautifully.Have not tried on the bedroom carpet yet,  so I may do another post in a few days. Right now,  I am very pleased and excited,  this is going to make cleaning so much easier,  almost fun!",One
Barb B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Positive review...German Shepherd approved.,the United States,20-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"After reading all the negative reviews, I read a well written and thoughtful review by a woman named Cherish V...I bought it because of her review. I am NOT disappointed.  I am so happy that I bought this. We have 2 German shepherds, 2 cats and 5 humans live in the house (one of them is 100 and tends to spill his coffee everywhere) I wouldn’t say our kitchen floor is super disgusting but it’s white so everything shows. I didn’t even vacuum first just to see how good it was. This cleaned it with little effort by me. That right there is fantastic. I now have a 9month old granddaughter and I will feel more comfortable with her exploring now. I have another bissell product to clean carpets, it is also amazing.",

We love every minute of it. This Bissell is an answer to a prayer. I can go from my linoleum in the kitchen to hardwood in the rest of the downstairs without missing a beat. The cord is long and perfect.  I can sweep my rugs, wash my rugs and my floors back and forth with only pushing a button.Every wish list/registry  should have BISSELL CROSSWAVE as the first requested item.",One
Kelsey ,5.0 out of 5 stars,In love with this thing!,the United States,5-Jun-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"This thing has been a life saver! I had the cheapest model of the Tineco before this and I hated that thing (battery constantly died, had to clean like 7 parts in total after each use, had to empty the dirty water tank 3 or more times during use, and had to keep refilling the clean water tank over and over during use) it was a total pain in the ass! I wish I would've known this in the first place but I'm just glad I FINALLY decided to purchase the crosswave. I know I will get quite a bit of use out of it and I hope for many more years to come because I would literally be in tears if this thing quit on me!

We have a toddler, a dog, and 2 cats, so I’m always cleaning. I just did the first floor of my house and can’t believe the amount of dirt and hair it picked up even though it looked pretty clean beforehand. The photo I uploaded shows what it picked up from our small kitchen (~12ft x 18ft...wiped a couple tiles with a damp paper towel afterward to see if it the floor was really clean, and it definitely was!). It even cleaned up some stuck on food under the toddler’s seat at the dining room table with ease. Really hope this thing lasts because it is definitely a timesaver and my floors look and feel great.",One
Brittany Moore,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have never been so in love.,the United States,18-Mar-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,If you're looking at this right now and you have animals in your house just buy it. I have never been more in love with the household appliance. My husband almost had to sleep on the couch because I love this more than him when I first used it. I've used it a few times now it hasn't lost suction it picks up all the animal hair while mopping. Yes the floors did look a little streaky after the first time just because of how much dirt that there is that it is getting off. It does take a few uses to actually get your floors good and clean. But I think that speaks levels about how clean your floors are getting compared to a traditional mop. I also had a Bissell spin wave and I felt like it was just moving the dirt around versus actually sucking it off of the floor. I can now clean my whole 1200 square foot house and about an hour. Versus the 2 to 3 hours it would normally take having to whip out the broom the mops and the swiffer. it does require a little TLC at the end of each session for you to clean out the machine. But I really don't mind being able to do that as I now know how much it's actually getting up and that it will continue to work because you're able to clean out everything so it doesn't get clogged. It will suck up things as large as dog food pieces with ease as well as getting all the minut little hairs and pieces of dirt on your floor. it may be a little pricey but it is definitely worth it and I would definitely buy this again so if you're looking at this and you have any animals in your house just buy it.,

maria gentile,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase!,the United States,28-Dec-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I had to sift through the great reviews as well as bad reviews. Looked at a few before getting this one. First it was extremely easy to assemble. Great feature is how it cleans hardwood and tile floors! Suction is great! I have had to clean off hair on the roller. Cleaning roller, other parts is easy. Picks up dirt but it did not do well on smaller size rugs. So those go into the wash. It did great on spot cleaning larger areas rugs. I find I still need a deep carpet cleaner on high traffic areas, but it got the worst of dirt out. Left a nice clean scent. It’s not heavy or bulky, cleans itself but I needed to clean the roller to my satisfaction. I am very happy with this purchase!",

C,3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s ok but,the United States,15-Aug-21,CrossWave,,"I seriously expected this to be the “all in one” type of thing. It’s really not. I still have to clean up “spots” ,sweep and light mop first. I was really hoping to ditch the traditional stuff especially for the price point. Got mine at Lowe’s and came here to see if anyone else had issues. I mop twice a day and sweep often. I have a toddler and a few older kids.. so messes happen. This doesn’t pick them up! It did get my floor clean (the wipe test) after the process I stated above. However, you have to move super slow, I could’ve cleaned the floor  3x traditionally in the same amount of time… especially when you add time to empty fill and clean the machine each use.  I see this being a secondary cleaner and works great for that, but I’d never pay more then 100$ for it. It’s over marketed and over valued. Probably gonna return the item and get a tineco insteadPhoto taken after first use and cleaned (sitting on drying stand)",
Greg Nugent,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality, Poor Performance, Poor Support",the United States,31-Mar-20,CrossWave,,"I bought this product just a little over two years ago and have used it about 20 times on my 1400 square foot house which is 100% wood flooring. Guess what, it died literally days after the warranty expired and Bissell will not support. I am an engineer and I have been repairing my own appliances for many years. The brush stopped spinning, so I opened up the base unit and discovered that the brush motor had seized. The compartment where it is housed is not sealed so it is exposed to constant exposure to moisture. The motor housing and interior of the motor were quite rusted and this is what caused the motor to seize. How can you have a motor with ferrous materials exposed to water? Unfortunately, Bissell does not make this part available to on-line parts retailers so I can't get a replacement part. Service center wants more money to repair than a refurb unit. I have used this item maybe 20 times and it is now worthless. I called their support center and after a 45 minute hold time was told that I was out of luck. They did offer me to buy a new unit at about $15 off retail. Really? Why would I buy another Bissell product? Honestly, I was barely mildly satisfied with its performance: it cannot get within the last inch or two of the walls, so you have to go over afterward with another tool. It also would not get up anything more than slightly hard to clean. At least a dozen times per cleaning I would have to lean down and rub a spot loose and with very little pressure to get what the machine could not. And the cleanup afterward takes almost as long as running it across the floors.",One
Ali,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!!,the United States,8-Apr-21,CrossWave,,"This is a great cleaner. Not sure why people posted bad reviews. It picks up sand, pennies, little legs oarts, dirt, crud. It has cut my cleaning time in half because I don’t have to sweep or vacuum then fill mop bucket and mop.  It literally takes 90 seconds to clean after using it. Less time then filling bucket and emptying mop bucket after cleaning. I give it 5 stars. I have little ones snd am constantly cleaning. I clean regularly and couldn’t believe the muck and sand this picked up from my wood floors. I guess mopping was just scooting it around. My floors were shiny and clean after using. They were dull before. This has made life much easier. Get one you won’t be disappointed. Has great suction power.",

Carol Y.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t live without it,the United States,21-Aug-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I love love love my Bissell Crossweave. Love how easy it is to go from carpet to tile floors and it does an amazing job at cleaning. I’m so disgusted yet satisfied after each vacuum/mop since I can see how dirty the water is with all the little scraps and hair, human and bunny fur. Before it would take me about 2 hours to vacuum first then go back with a mop and pail but now it cuts the time in half to clean my whole house. I can’t think of anything negative except that you will need to clean the mop after each use which makes sense since you don’t want dirty water sitting in your Crossweave but that takes the same amount of time as cleaning a mop and pail.",
DM Swiech,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the Job,the United States,8-May-21,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Nice cleaner.  I have 3000 square feet of tile and have tried several cleaners.  Biggest challenges I have had with other cleaners is either the tank is too small, the unit itself is big and cumbersome or it leaves streaks.  This unit is a great middle ground for me and covers the bases for size, ease of use and nice finish to floor.  My only hesitation is that every Bissell product I have had in the past quickly brakes in one way or another.  I hope this one is different.  If not, I will be back to take away stars.",One

Michael Bohdanowicz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pricey.. but worth it.  The Crosswave is the king of the floor cleaning hill.,Canada,15-Jan-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I own both the Crosswave and the Hoover Floormate Deluxe.  The Floormate Deluxe is better at:TEXTURED TILE / GROUT - Slightly better at getting off caked on dry stains.  The Crosswave doesn't have the same pressure.  If you have textured tile you will appreciate the extra stain cleaning power of the Floormate.  The tile brush allows more pressure to be applied to the recesses of the tile and the lower grout lines.  If you plan to use either floor cleaner for just textured tile the Floormate Deluxe is the cleaner to get. (or a rotary mop)  The Crosswave is better at:FLAT SURFACES - Subway tile, hardwood floor, vinyl plank and laminate.LARGE DEBRIS - Pet hair, dog food, cheerios, animal crackers. - These get picked up on the first pass with the Crosswave.  The hoover uses a squeegee to help lift the water off the floor so the pieces of food/dirt get pushed forward unless you tilt one side of the machine up.  This gets real old after a while.  Especially when you have 3000 ft^2 to clean.CLEANING (post floor cleaning) - Pet hair is harder to get out of the Floormate.  I find myself trying to ""fish"" the dog hair out of the Floormate with my pinkies.  If you don't have time to completely clean the Floormate and the pet hair dries on the inside of the cleaning head... you are in for a treat.  By comparison the Crosswave is a pleasure to clean.  Sure you have to run it in a tray and pull out the roller head... but you have to do it with the Floormate as well if you want the product to last more than a year. Besides... the entire process takes maybe 30 seconds.  There is Crosswave lazy... then there is unemployed bum lazy.SPEED - I can clean at least twice as fast with the Crosswave.  It applies moisture more evenly to the floor surface and it leaves the floor dryer than the Floormate.  The Floormate requires at least 2-3 passes of the same area.  The first pass lays down the water and the brushes distribute the water.  The second pass is the real cleaning pass that does the majority of the cleaning.  The 3rd pass is solely to clean up the residual water from the 2nd pass.  Even after you stop applying water to the floor it still takes a while for the water to stop dripping from the head of the cleaner.  On the other hand, the Crosswave lets you perform a quick clean of the area.  Foot marks on dark laminate or a quick touch up by the front door before company arrives seems less like a chore.When I just owned the Floormate I found myself mopping on weekends when we had were in a hurry to clean.  We would use the Floormate for the ""entire house"" cleaning days.  You can't perform a ""quick clean"" with eh Floormate.  I would say you are looking at 30 minutes per 500 ft^2  with the Floormate.  Depending on how dirty your floors are you are looking at 10-30 minutes for the same area with the Crosswave.NO VACUUMING REQUIRED - We have two young children and a 200+ pound English Mastiff who sheds continuously.  I can clean the floors with the Crosswave without having to sweep/vacuum first.  This is a HUGE time saver.  I would have toBoth machines will remove caked on mustard and dried dog drool in a matter of seconds.  If a stain doesn't lift after a few passes, soak the area with the machine and keep going.  Wait for the solution to soak for a minute or two then come back to the spot.  If it still doesn't come off the floor take a scrub brush to it.  For a machine to remove anything more in the first pass would require such abrasion that the floor surface would be compromised over time.Both units are going to do a better job than a mop pushes the dirt into the recesses, these devices scrub and vacuum.My personal opinion is the Crosswave, despite its price , is a better overall floor cleaner.  The hardwood floors look shinier when clean and they feel cleaner on your feet.  The Crosswave ends up  saving you a lot of time.  It's quite fast once you get the hang of it and it doesn't require any floor prep before you use it (sweep/vacuum).If budget isn't a concern go with the Crosswave,  otherwise the Floormate is a damn good cleaner for the money.",110
Erika,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poco practico para su precio.. hay mejores opciones,Mexico,17-Jul-20,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Haré una pequeña comparación que te servirá, si lo que deseas es invertir en limpieza de tu hogar,porque este producto no es nada económico para ser criticado asi...Yo tengo varios,  por mencionar, Hoover floormate de luxe, bisell de vapor, roborock s5 max, roborock s6 turbo, pureclean y braava irobot,Hablemos de este bisell crosswave todo en 1, aunque es buena su calidad y diseño, no hay queja por eso, y que también es más ligera que la hoover floormate luxe, no deja de ser  pesada y cansada;  y si quiero trapear rápido prefiero otras opciones, en mi caso los robot como braava y/o el aspirador roborock s5 max o S6 Turbo, aunque más caros,  han sido y son, sin duda alguna, la mejor opción e inversión, porque solo se programan, se les  pone la mopa, y listo!... Ellos hacen la función de mantener pisos brillantes sin que te desgastes, yo los Amo! después de utilizarlos, este BISELL se te hace impractico y poco funcional,solo lo utilizo cuando me quiero cansar, o si quiero hacer la labor o trapeado más intenso... además mis robot entran hasta donde no te esperas y en lugares donde puedes sacar completa la pelusa... este bisell me gusto por su diseño y ser más ligero que la hoover, prefiero este... pero solo lo tengo de reserva y lo uso poco.. y en conclusión,  hoy considero que su precio es sumamente costoso para su funcionalidad y practicidad y que es pesadoSi haces el gasto,  invierte más y te quitarás además de polvo, pelusa y suciedad, también dolores y cansancio, ahorrando mucho tiempo para otras cosas más importantes.. piénsalo!",9
S. Chambers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great Bissell product,Canada,18-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I hate mopping floors, I'm the type that would rather clean a toilet with my bare hands than mop floors, but with this it's easy and fast.  Not to forget, the solution smells great. I don't know how I'm going to express how much I love this mop.  After reading another review I decided that this may just be my cleaning soul mate item.  I have 2 cats, 1 long hair and 1 short hair, a doxie, toy poodle, 2 long hair adult women and an adult male who is in denial and a losing battle with male pattern baldness.  You can imagine the hair that collects on the floors in a 2 floor 3 bed 2 1/2 bath home.  (I even have those tub shroom thingies and every other day I remove a cousin IT from them)  I don't have dust bunnies when I sweep, I have extra furbabies.Hubby grabbed the CrossWave and put it together.  Well, not really, he snapped the handle on and put the detergent cup on. ( A 5 year old could do it)  He fired it up and oh my, it is a miracle machine.  No need to spend 45 minutes to an hour sweeping corners and removing hair and so on.  Just fill the tank and go.  It even pulled those short annoying hairs from the grout in the kitchen and bath tiles.  Another awesome product by Bissell.  Now if they would only come up with a solution for loading and unloading the dishwasher.",19
Adil Essawi,1.0 out of 5 stars,1 year later review update!,Canada,29-May-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"1 year of experience review:The Bissel cleaner markets itself as a device that replaces sweeping, mopping and vacuuming in one machine.Unlike a regular broom it can't get into the corners or edges because of its plastic casing so I have to get out the broom anyways.It also struggles to Vacuum up fruit loops so the commercial is false advertising. When it comes to your carpet you need a vacuum that can do deep sucking and this just doesn’t compare to even a low end vacuum. So I have to get out my vacuum anyways.Unlike a regular mop it cannot apply more scrubbing pressure to a tough spot. It also won’t clean about 1.5 inches around your edges because of its design. So I need to get out my mop anyways.in order to get a good clean you'll need your other equipment still. This definitely does not replace other cleaning tools and a year later I actually don’t use this Bissel cleaner anymore this is because I can’t rely on it to do a good job AND cleaning up the vacuum after is a real nuisance.",19
chiqitabanana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't be happier!,Canada,31-Oct-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Very happy with my purchase!  It has made cleanup alot less stressful.  Our entrance/kitchen/dining room has been a stressful ordeal to keep clean especially with a toddler who loves to get dirty outside then come tromping in all over the tile floors.We have quite a few pine needles that make their way inside as well and this machine has made cleanup a breeze!I have noticed it doesn't quite get the edges and more stuck on stuff is going to need you to scrape it off with your hands still.The floor is dry just about instantly which is great for preventing slips and falls.  Cleaning the machine is done on a few easy steps.  I empty the dirty container into my toilet and flush it away as opposed to the kitchen sink.It does go through cleaning formula pretty quick, so that could add up, and if you want to use a different cleaning solution It voids the warranty fyi.The cleaning solution is a very light and pleasant smell.The floors have never looked or felt more clean, even my husband commented how nice the tile felt on his feet after I cleaned.Highly recommend this product!",12
Joseph Simone,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to clean,Canada,30-Dec-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"So far, does what it advertises. Vacuums and washes floors and carpets. Very easy to clean. The only reason is doesn't get a 5-star is because it doesn't have any kind of hose attachment. I need a small hand vac to get into corners or under the bed or any tight spaces for dust. Doesn't do edges and corners well. Otherwise it's a sturdy machine that picks up all kinds of dirt and debris off floors and carpets. It's nice to use the wet cleaning solution on the carpet rather than just dry. It dries quickly.",19

Water evaporates very quickly off of the floors and even area rugs ( I had my doubts about carpets, but it worked great and dried fast). I used a multi surface brush and it worked good, but I also purchased the carpet brush and it worked for carpets better. The whole thing comes apart to clean out he dirt and particles. Everything can be rinsed and put back together in minutes. Storage tray is very handy. I highly recommend this cleaner.",10

Helen N.,3.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted to LOVE this machine,Canada,10-Mar-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to LOVE this machine! Sadly I had to return it for the following reason: It only works on perfectly smooth floors! So if you have tile floors, older wood floors, or different surfaces where there is even a tiny lip between the two, you will get smudges and water lines.  I read about the fact that it doesn't go right to the edge of floors, and it's not a huge issue, unless you have dark floors, then it is really noticeable.  Also, I didn't find it put out enough water for my liking.  On the positive side, it did a nice job vacuuming medium-pile carpet.  So, if you have perfectly flat, even light colored flooring I highly recommend you try this. All others steer clear.",6

I took it apart, as you have to do to clean it and found that dust and dirt was stuck in what I will call a design flaw, the L shape that goes from the base to the handle. It is extremely difficult to clean that space.  Last time I tried using it the brush wouldn’t even turn! Such a disappointment !I bought it online and tried to return it.

I was hoping for something more powerful and more user friendly. The transition between carpet and hardfloor may leave a dirt path behind.all and all its not a bad product but it is not for a deep clean and more for an every day day tool. The thing is it you have to empty and clean it before the next use. So at this point it is just another cleaner that will most likely stay in the cleaning stuff closet.,2

I'm not sure why one person said it doesn't pick up a cheerio, because mine picked up a piece of hard dog food without a struggle.Pros: Cleans floors very well.Sleek machine, nice colours and overall appearance.Can buy extra attachments and brushesVery easily can remove tank for fill up, andTo empty the dirty water.Easy to remove brush for cleaningIt most certainly does pick up slightly heavy objects, such as a piece of dog food.Cons: Kind of loudDoes do edges well.No removable attachment for spot cleaning or edge cleaning.Does not come with more brushes or cleaning solution.I got mine for a great deal in the warehouse store. It was returned by someone, I think, but had no damage at all. It was just in a brown box. I am not complaining about that.

Kerry,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its not bad but not great,Canada,12-Jun-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Its pretty heavy for petite people. The powerhead is quite bulky so its not great around corners and furniture  and doesn't reach well under beds. Suction is great, on carpets it picks up so much stuff my old vacuum leaves behind. For tile floors its a great wet mop, better than mopping with any of my previous mops and quicker. The dirty water is a clear sign its working.  For med/low pile carpet shampooing its ok, better for thinner rugs and not for heavy pile carpets. You must take it apart and clean it well after use, if you leave water in the reservoir or wet brush etc you'll end up with that musty stale water smell which is hard to get out.",One

Heather,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Clean Floors But Some Annoying Flaws,Canada,28-Sep-16,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Our home is about 60% hardwood/tile and 40% carpet. My tool of choice for cleaning my floors is a Swiffer Wetjet, which does a good job. Once in a while I break out a really mop and bucket, but I loathe all the mess and the time it takes. This Bissell CrossWave is a really good replacement for both methods. It is almost as convenient as a Swiffer, but does just about as good a job as a proper mop and bucket do, with the added bonus of being able to clean area rugs as well.The CrossWave is very easy to put together--just click the handle into the base and away you go. To clean a floor, you just need to fill up the clean water/formula container and pop it in. There are two fill levels, depending on the area you intend to clean: 350 sq feet or 750 sq feet. These are pretty rough estimates, and you will use more if you clean rugs or go back and forth over a tough spot several times. (The CrossWave comes with an 8oz bottle of formula, which is enough to fill the clean water container to the large floor level twice.)The CrossWave is about as loud as a vacuum, which makes sense since that is really what it is. You select your floor type using a button on the handle, pull the trigger to dispense the cleaning fluid, and move the vacuum back and forth, sucking up the water as you go. The vacuum picks up most of the water, but my floors were still damp for about 30 minutes or so afterwards (even after running the CrossWave over them without the trigger pressed so it would pick up more water.) My area rugs stayed wet for several hours, but I did clean them on a damp day which likely slowed down the drying process. DO NOT use this on regular carpets, as you will soak the carpet and ruin your underpad!While the process is time consuming (going back and forth, and waiting for the floors to dry), the results are great. My floors feel amazingly clean, and my area rugs look like new. There is none of that slightly sticky feeling that sometimes happens after using the Swiffer (and none of the excess spray either). Even though I had washed my floors the day before I received the CrossWave, it still managed to pick up a lot of dirt and dust the Swiffer had left behind.The CrossWave also comes with a storage/cleaning tray. It can be used, with a little bit of the floor formula, to clean the brush, and then you can store the CrossWave in the tray to keep the brush up off the ground. The CrossWave is compact enough to store away in a closet, and it is safe to also store it in the basement. It just needs to be kept somewhere where it won't freeze because that could damage it internally.While this is a really great machine, there are some serious flaws.- The power cord is much too short. And, because of where it is attached to the machine, it constantly gets in the way and is easy to step on. (There is a hook you can clip it through, but it pulls out of it very easily.)- There is no headlight. A light does come on when the triggered is pulled, but a continuous light would be very useful.- The noise for when the dirty water container is full sounds like the vacuum is blocked. It actually took me a little while to realize what it meant.- There is no indicator showing when the clean water/formula container is empty. You need to keep checking.- There are lots of nooks and crannies in the dirty water container for human and pet hair to get stuck on. It can be difficult clean.- The head is wider than a standard mop/Swiffer, so it can't get into tight places like around a toilet or under a cabinet.The CrossWave isn't perfect, but for now it is far and away my favourite way to wash my floors. The may be loud and a bit of a pain to use, but the results are great.",7
JXDC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid, easy to use.",Canada,4-Apr-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Unit arrived very quickly and packaged well.Out of the box you get a small 8oz sample size bottle of multi-surface liquid which will cover about 1200sqft (that's about what I was able to get out of it), a multi-purpose spin brush, the cleaning tray, and the spin brush drying holder and of course the unit itself.Unit works excellent on sealed hard wood floors, I didn't find any streaks or left over residue. In my kitchen I have ceramic tile with a linen finish that catches on every type of mop I've used and the Crosswave does a decent job cleaning them, not excellent, but definitely better than a regular mop. Using the unit does cut cleaning time but I wouldn't consider it a cleaning necessity. If you have hardwood stairs like I do you'll still need the swiffer or a mop and bucket to clean them and this unit does not have great edge/corner coverage so forget cleaning a tight spot like a powder room. I have not tried it on an area rug.Another thing to note is to watch the level of dirty water the unit has picked up, at some point the container will reach a midway fill point and the unit will stop sucking water. You'll probably wonder what's happening unit you realize that although the container isn't full of dirty water, there's a float that'll tell the unit it's full.With that being said I'm pretty satisfied with initial use and what it can do, I will update my review if things change.",9

thuynh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,Canada,3-Feb-17,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I have both this and the Hoover floormate deluxe model.  Both are very good.  If you have lots of ceramic and tiles or linoleum, then I would recommend the Hoover.  However, if you have carpet, hardwood, and/or tiles or any mix of the above, then I would recommend the Bissell.  This thing is light, maneuverable and works very well.  The hoover beats it in scrubbing power (in my opinion), but if you're willing to give up a little in scrubbing power, you'll gain much in every other aspect.  In my opinion the Bissell is better to serve most homes.",3

Arkbird,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quicker than a mop, but requires higher maintenance.",Canada,2-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"It's a neat little cleaner for hard floors that gets the job done quite effectively. The soap that came with it has a good light smell to it that even though is clearly a chemical mix, doesn't bother me as much as some other products out there (think Mrclean and such). I also tend to think this cleans my floors better than my cheap mop and bucket combo, but it is also 10x the price of it. But you should know that there was one crusty old spot that this unit was not able to remove, because there is really no way to add pressure to the roller. I had to pass slowly over it somewhere around 20 times to get any difference, but even then it wouldn't remove it completely. A heavy duty mode would of been neat.The design is alright but not perfect, as almost all the parts are removable and washable, which according to the instruction manual, is exactly what you should do anyway, after each uses (look at all the parts you gotta lay out to air dry before reassembling, in the photo below). Quite a task if you ask me. The small issue is the dirty water tank is shared with the vacuum tank. They should have been separated or at least have a mesh screen keep the debris picked up from being emptied out as I pour the used water out. Speaking of vacuum, it's really cool that the vacuum functions sucks up the water and sends it to the dirty water tank, just like the industrial machines would. That aids immensely in the drying process which can take over an hour with ANY other device I've used. You very likely know exactly what happens to a freshly cleaned floor that is still wet. The power cord was a good idea, as I really see no reason or scenario where you would use this somewhere without A/C. I've had countless cordless devices become totally inoperable when the battery die just because the manufacturer thought it a better idea not to make them serviceable or because the battery was worth more than buying a new unit. Please note I HAVE NOT tried this on carpets yet and I will update this review if I ever do.Overall, I really like this cleaner. It gets the job done quickly and effectively, without having to deal with messy buckets of water and carrying them back and forth. This unit seems oriented more towards semi-professional uses as it would be perfect for a small office, but probably wouldn't last very long in a heavy duty environment. As it comes down to price (over 300$ retail as of the time of this review), you're probably wondering if it's worth that much. Even though it saves quite a bit of time over traditional methods, unless you have all the rooms in your house to clean, I could not justify the spending. Questions? Ask away!",5
Hugh Jass,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell Crosswave Multi-Surface,Canada,2-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"A fantastic floor cleaner and especially a time saver. Bissell is definitely my go to brand when it comes to any type of cleaning on my floors. I own a few Bissell brand products now; little green machine carpet cleaner, vacuum, and now a multi surface cleaner. I could not be happier with this brand as a whole.So with owning a vacuum, swiffer, broom, and mop for floors, and a small unit to wash the carpet. I wasn’t sure if i even needed this multi surface cleaner. But now with owning a machine that does it all without having to change a thing - I have not looked back once. It takes me half the time to clean my floors. Not only is it easy to use, upon opening everything, is very easy to set up - I simply read the “quick start instructions” that fell out of the manual and the care instructions in the manual when i was done. It comes with a small bottle of “multi surface” cleaner for tile, area rug, or hardwood to get you started. I was pleased using it on my tile and carpets - it did not leave any sticky residue or streaks. As of oct 1st 2016 there isn't anywhere i've been able to find online or in local stores that sells the multi surface cleaner. I did find a few American websites though.When you start the Crosswave, it functions as just a vacuum. No need to wash the floors if you don’t want. There’s button on the handle to spray the cleaner into the brush. Transition from an area rug or carpet to hardwood/tile is as simple as pressing a button it takes only 10 seconds to change over. It handles very well on carpet and tile - maneuvering takes little to no effort with the swivel head. It has a really long cord - which can be wrapped up on the back of the unit and has a small wedge to hold the length out you desire. It’s lightweight, compact and easy to store. It even comes with a small plastic floor stand. You can even buy specific brushes/cleaners for your Crosswave depending on what you want to use it for; multi use, hard floors, or carpets.My only complaint is that the sides could use a small rubber wheel or something to making going around edges and baseboards smoother/easier.Update: Amazon Canada now carries the Bissell Multi-Surface Cleaner. I love this thing and am still using mine months later 2-3x a week to do my tile floors and area rugs. A few notes - I have to lift up the machine under my kitchen sink to rinse out the hose between the floor and the collection bin. And the filter needs about 36-48 hours to dry after being rinsed out. I have 2 dogs so I definitely vacuum/sweep first - makes doing my floors 10x easier. It's still super easy and convenient to use and I can't imagine cleaning my floors without this thing now.",2
Nat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smooth operation. Easy to clean.,Canada,10-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"I have always used traditional mops for cleaning my kitchen floor, and I wanted to give this Bissell cleaner a try to see how it works. I have been using this multi-surface cleaner everyday for a week now, and here are my early impressions.- The cleaner is very intelligently built. One container on the back stores the cleaning liquid, and another container in the front captures the dirty water. So, very little water is actually left behind on the floors. I love that technology, especially because that function definitely avoids people from slipping on a surface that is ""too wet.""- There are buttons on the top of the handle labeled ""rug"" and ""hard floor"" which are pretty self-explanatory. There is a trigger underneath the handle grip. This trigger can be pulled like a gun trigger to release the cleaning solution into the mop brush. I like this design, especially because it allows me a level of control on how much cleaning solution I want to dispense based on my need. If I see my floor is too dirty and I could use a bit extra scrubbing, I will release more cleaning solution. If the floor looks relatively clean, I will release less solution. So, the trigger allows me that level of control, and I am a fan of that feature.- The one thing that bugged me is that the cleaning solution is dispensed from the two sides only, which means I get streaks of water on two ends of the mop brush onto the floor. That bugged me for the first few times, but I realize that it is due to the way the mop brush function is designed. The clean solution is dispensed from two ends of the brush, while the dirty water is vacuumed from the middle. So, that design limits the way you can spray the clean solution into the mop brush, and the product is engineered to deliver that solution only from the two ends. That is why I think everyone who uses this product can see those two streaks of water on the two ends. Having said that, I don't think that diminishes the performance because once you move the machine forward/backward, the rotating mop brush takes care of those streaks.- I like the fact that most parts that need cleaning or washing to keep them in tip-top shape are removable and washable. The container that holds the cleaning solution, the container that holds the dirty water, and the brush that mops the floor are all removable and washable. That is excellent for two reasons. First, it allows me to get those parts out and clean them properly before I use them again. This means, the parts are clean and work great each time. Second, being able to take the parts out and clean them regularly means they will last longer. So, I don't have to replace the parts too soon. That saves money.- However, from the viewpoint of a consumer who would have to replace these parts in the future (especially the mop brush, which will probably get damaged sooner than the two containers), I wish there was information about where we could go about getting these replacement parts.

That is a critical information, and needs to be included in the product listing page as well as in the product manual that comes in the package.",3
SN,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you've got a lot of hardwood/tile floors, this cleaner is well worth it just for the time it will save you",Canada,6-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"In A NutshellI normally use a Swiffer before I use a steam mop to clean my hardwood and tile floors. The Bissell CrossWave can turn what was two steps into one. The CrossWave vacuums and wet cleans in a single step. That is a huge time saver. It also doesn't hurt that the spinning dual-action roller brush does a way better job of cleaning my floors than a wet Swiffer or my steam mop. My wife's not a big fan of cleaning my steam mop heads in the washer, so it's no surprise that she likes that the CrossWave's roller brush can be cleaned in a sink.The CrossWave has two tanks - one for the water + cleaning solution, and another to collect the dirt from the cleaning process. The dirty tank gets pretty gross, especially if you have pet hairs being picked up. You can flush the dirt down the toilet. The dirty tank's also pretty easy to clean, which is a nice thing. I found that the cleaning solution compartment has plenty of capacity to clean a large room. I used the CrossWave with the cleaning solution filled to the ""small room"" line and was able to cover enough floor space that would require 2 tanks worth of water in my steam mop, so I was definitely pleased about that.It's definitely a great buy if you are used to a two step cleaning process (dry followed by wet) for your hard flooring. For me, it's more effective than how I was doing it before, with the exception of dealing with tight spots.The Good Parts* The dual-action brush is quite effective for getting stains out of floors - it got rid of some stubborn stains in my textured tile that my steam mop couldn't get out* Vacuum and wet cleaner eliminates the step of sweeping/swiffing before wet cleaning* Easy to put together* Easy to use - there are two modes - hard floor and rug, and a trigger to spray the cleaning solution. That's basically it.* The dual action roller brush is like a plastic brush combined with a cotton mop - it's quite effective at getting dirt and stains out of the floor* Roller brush is easy to clean (clean under a running tap)* Comes with a small container of multi-surface cleaning solution* Two tanks- one for cleaning solution, the other for the collected dirty water* The cleaning solution tank is fairly large* The cleaning solution is pet friendly and doesn't have an overwhelming scent - we generally avoid putting chemicals on the floor if they're not pet safe* Comes with a base for storage* Base has an attachment for drying the roller brush* Can clean area rugs as well (I did not test this since I don't have any rugs)Could Be Better* The unit is quite loud, but not unusual for a vacuum unit like this* The head is pretty big and may not be able to get into tight areas (you might want to keep your steam mop around for that)* The unit itself takes a bit of space when not in use, and may not be ideal for apartment dwellers* The cord is long, but I still felt it could be longer",3
TA,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing machine,Canada,29-Sep-16,CrossWave,,"When I first read about this machine, I admit, I was very intimidated.  I am not good with anything that needs to be ""assembled"".However, when I get the machine and started reading the instructions (and assembling the parts) I love that Bissell made it incredibly easy to understand.  All the pieces are interlocking and it is very easy to get this machine up and running.  They even include a cleaning tray for storage.  It is obvious that this was very well thought out.What I like:The machine is lightweight, yet solid enough to move around my apartment well.  The machine ""flexes"" so it can go under the couch or bed.  The handle offers up a good grip, which means I don't struggle with moving the machine from one spot to the next.The concept of incorporating the two tanks (one in the front and the other on the back) is a good one.  You can easily remove the tank to insert the water and product but you can also see how full/empty it is - same thing for the tank that gathers the waste.  Opening and cleaning it out is a breeze as well as cleaning the filter.I also love how powerful the brush is.  I have a cat who loves to throw litter around and this machine picks it up without any trouble.  Same with pet hair and dust bunnies.  Makes my floors (and carpets - although I have only a few of those) look clean and makes the room feel fresh.Extremely easy to clean.  You can remove the brush to pass it under water, you can empty out the canisters to clean those out, so all the important pieces can be kept sanitary.I like the sleek look of this Bissell.What I am not crazy about.Why is the cord so short?  I would love to have been able to move around more with this machine without having to connect and disconnect all the time.  Also, the cord is a bit hard to handle and this is especially obvious when you try to store it (at the back of the machine).  This is the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.The machine uses up a lot of product, so it can get expensive to use this.Having said all of this, I still believe this is an amazing machine that combines cleaning floors AND rugs.",3
Brenda P,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't totally replace my vacuum and mop, but offers convenience.",Canada,7-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"Prior to using this I was using a Dyson Animal upright for vacuuming, sweeping with a broom as needed, and for mopping I was using a microfiber mop or the Swiffer steam mop. I was not totally happy with either of them. I have mostly hard floors, and the Dyson was fine on the rugs and carpets but terrible on hard floor as it would often fling debris around. Mopping was tedious and my laminate flooring often shows streaks, no matter what I use to clean it.The Bissell Crosswave has been a big help and I’ve switched to using mostly this only. Unfortunately, it won’t be replacing my mop and bucket and Dyson entirely, but my Swiffer Steamer is gone. It does making vacuuming so much easier and it has almost totally replaced my broom. It does an awesome job at getting up dust and debris off hard floors. I find that it does a nice job of keeping my floors clean with minimal streaking, but I don’t trust that it gets it clean as I would like. I’ve noticed that in certain areas, where there is a noticeable spill that has dried, the Crosswave takes a little longer than expected to clean. Perfect for upkeep and as needed, but I will most likely do a mop and bucket cleaning every other week. The same goes for vacuuming rugs and carpets, good for day to day upkeep but my Dyson is still needed for harder to get areas and for upholstery which I now do as needed or every other day.Emptying the dirty tank can be pretty gross as I have 3 cats and the tank often contains clumps of fur and other things that could cause drain clogs if you aren’t careful. The machine is easy to clean though, otherwise.Right now I can only use the Crosswave as a vacuum since I cannot find the solution in stores. Hopefully it will be available soon.Overall, I really like it. I think it has made my life a lot easier and will continue to do so. It is a big time saver, that’s for sure.",2
Brandon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Main Cleaning Tool!,Canada,25-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"Pros and Cons in case you don’t want to read the full reviewPros:-Works on rugs and hardwood/tiles-Saves Time-Saves Space-Easy to CleanCons:-Residual water left on group when you turn it offThe Review:I live in an apartment with 4 other people and the only cleaning tools we had were a severely used broom and mop. There was absolutely no way for us to vacuum our rug, or efficiently clean the apartment so that’s why I decided to treat myself to an all in one multi surface cleaner. All in all, I really like this vacuum! It works on every floor of my apartment, saves time and space compared to a regular vacuum and mop, and the multi surface cleaner is really easy to disassemble and clean.When using the vacuum, I noticed that there were two options: one is for rugs and the other for hard floors. This is extremely convenient for me. I don’t have to avoid certain areas of my apartment or have to buy another product especially for rugs (or hardwood floors). I remember owning a small vacuum before and it only worked well on rugs, but not on hard floors. As well, this multi surface cleaner saves a lot of time! Instead of sweeping first, then priming the mop, and finally, mopping, I can just prime the multi surface cleaner and do both at the same time! Not only do I save time with this surface cleaner, I also save space. Instead of owning 2 household appliances, I now own one. Lastly, the multi surface cleaner is very easy to clean. All I have to do is put the multi surface cleaner on the cleaning tray, pour some water in it and have the vacuum suck it up. Then, I put the mop on the drying rack, and empty out the container.While I really do like this product, I have a small complaint. When I turn off the multi surface cleaner, there’s always a small puddle of water. When I finish mopping/vacuuming, I usually keep it on until I put it back on the cleaning tray.Overall, I really do like this product. It’s become my main cleaning tool in the apartment.",10
Captain Canuck,5.0 out of 5 stars,CrossWave is an easy to use floor cleaner that saves you time and space,Canada,13-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"I have been using a combination of my regular floor brush, WORKSHOP wet/dry vacuum, and Swiffer Wet Jet to clean the floors and rugs in my home.  The Swiffer wet cleaner and shop vacuum weren't really a great combination to be using as a general floor cleaner.  This Bissell 'CrossWave' is a multi-surface floor cleaner that can go from hard floors to carpet or rugs without the need for a mop and a regular vacuum.The Bissell CrossWave floor cleaner comes in a plain looking brown box, and once opened is quick and easy to assemble.  Along with the main unit in the box is an 8 oz. bottle of multi-surface cleaner, storage tray, and user guide.Before use, you just need to add some water and some of the cleaning solution to the clean water tank.  Operating the CrossWave is easy and it has a good range of motion.  It's light, has great suction, and it gives you a long reach thanks to the long power cord.  Also, thanks to the suction and fabric brush bar, the floor isn't left as wet as a conventional mop or the Swiffer wet mop I was using.  You can see how much dirt and debris this cleaner picks up thanks to the clear disposal tank.  I was very happy with the amount of pick up from this product and definitely found it left my laminate flooring and bathroom tiles looking much cleaner.Cleaning out the CrossWave after use isn't much of a chore because it's easy and doesn't take much time.  Use the cleaning tray to suck up clean water to flush out all the dirt in the interior vacuum hoses.  Then you need to remove and empty the dirty water tank (I just dumped it in the toilet) and then rinse to let dry.  Same goes for the beater brush and filter ' rinse clean and then leave to air dry for 12-24 hours.::::: Pros :::::- Multi-use hard flooring, hardwood, and carpet- Good handling with swivel sphere design- Long power cord (I think it's 20 feet)- Easy to clean- Can use as vacuum without mop function- Best mop I've used, leaves floor only lightly wet::::: Cons :::::- Getting into edges and corners can be tough under cabinets- Wish it operated a little smoother along walls (smoother plastic or side guiding wheel)::::: Verdict :::::The Bissell CrossWave is an easy to use floor cleaner that saves you time and space.  I highly recommend for anyone who wants a combination tool that vacuums and mops, on any type of floors.As of October 13, I haven't been able to find the Multi-Surface Formula included with the CrossWave.  I checked Canadian Tire, Walmart, and Amazon, but this particular cleaning solution wasn't available.  You can still use this floor cleaner with the other Bissell formulas, however check the formula's labels whether it's designed for your flooring.Update: As of December 8 (2016) Amazon.ca now has a better selection of cleaning formulas for the CrossWave available. You can find the Multi-Surface Formula here: https://www.amazon.ca/Bissell-1789-Multi-Surface-Cleaning-Formula/dp/B01HID4V56.  Great news because I just ran out (after a couple months of cleaning every couple weeks).[...]",5
Jason R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Goodbye steam mops.,Canada,28-Sep-16,CrossWave,,"Long term update: 6/17/17I am keeping my review of the CrossWave at 5 stars.  It has continued to do an amazing job on our floors (engineered white oak).  It's strange, because our floors are not dark (a conscious decision for just this reason) they continue to look clean even when they clearly are not after using the CrossWave.  Every time we use it, the water comes out black.  It's disgusting but satisfying.  When you're actually using it, every time I think to myself ""is this thing even working?"" because all you see is some slight streaks of wetness as you go, the temptation is to go over and over the same area but it's doing what it should.  It is still easy to clean up after using it (there are a bunch of parts you have to rinse out but they all detach and go back together easily) and the machine still looks and works like new.One note, I ran out of the special Bissell cleaning formula once but had a jug of Bona refill left over and decided to try using it in the machine.  After some trial and error (not being sure how it was going to turn out) I've figured out that I can use the Bona stuff in the same concentration as the Bissell stuff (using the lines on the tank) and everything turns out great.I do use the Crosswave to clean the tile in the bathrooms and entryways in the house, and it works, but I feel the strength in the machine is mainly the wood floors.  It really does a way more thorough cleaning job than I ever would doing it manually with the mop/pads and only takes slightly longer (set up, clean up, and a few extra passes with just the vacuum without the liquid turned on just because I want to be extra sure about the water not getting into the floor).I would buy another if this one were to die on us (at least, if it lasts a reasonable amount of time, though it has shown no signs of having any kind of quality issues.  The machine does get quite warm to the touch after using it to go over a whole floor though but so far doesn't seem to mind it.Original review:Finally, a hard floor cleaner that actually works for more than just dry messes and seems to be actually safe for hardwood.  I had my reservations and doubts about the CrossWave prior to handling it in person I have been fooled before by products meant to clean hard floors that either worked poorly or I discovered later that they were totally unsafe for hardwood floors and really were only appropriate for tiled or solid surfaces of other kinds (I'm looking at you my previous best friend, the steam mop).Unlike a steam mop, the CrossWave doesn't inject water vapor into every crevice that it could possibly get into.  In fact, even though you ARE putting water on the surface the way it works is that the cleaning solution/water gets sucked right up again before it really gets a chance to seep in anywhere.  I've actually felt OK with using this on wood floors because of the fact that the floors really do feel pretty much dry after using it, certainly drier than just going over things with a mop and it does way better with bigger sticky spills than a mop ever does which tends to just dilute and push the mess around.So basically, how it works is that it replaces the usual bristles in a vacuum with what amounts to a brush roll of soft pads which won't scratch anything, soak up liquids and pull the mess off the floor.  It transfers water/cleaning solution from the ""clean"" tank up top to the roller, which cleans the floor and then sucks it up immediately into the ""dirty"" tank at the front.  When you're done you just dump the dirty tank and set the CrossWave on a tray that it comes with and then you can use the tray to clean the brush by running the CrossWave (without spray) while in the tray for a short while after filling the tray with clean water.  The roller does come out of the unit easily so you can just rinse it under a tap if it gets really dirty.Basically it really does work, it's way safer for the floors than a steam mop (though our steam mop does work better on tile, I have to say, as long as the mess isn't particularly voluminous and is just general grime).  I'll give it full marks for doing what it says it'll do and in a way that you can use it safely everywhere.There are a few things about this machine that are problematic though.  First, it's so loud... compared to using a steam mop it's like the difference between an electric car and a tractor.  Second, if you want it to look sparkling and pristine all the time you can forget about it without spending a lot of time cleaning the nooks and crannies around the head and the brush roll housing.  While it does do a pretty good job self-cleaning in the tray, it will remain looking dirty and there is no way around it unless you're going to get on your hands and knees every time and wipe it all out.  It's really not a problem, unless you're OCD about this kind of thing like I am.  I wish it had a retractable cord like my corded regular vacuum cleaner does, I hate winding cords, however it's not a deal breaker as our steam mops (yes, I have gone through several...) all had the same cord storage system as this, and most smaller vacuums/stick type vacuums are all this way.  The cord isn't super long but if you live in a house that is newer or has been through any kind of recent major renovation you won't have a problem with it... older houses where there was no consistency in the availability of electrical outlets may prove to be a bit more annoying.  The other thing is that it'll only really dry the floor if you go over it again with at least one second pass without using the spray trigger would have been a lot faster if this wasn't necessary.The steam mop is going to only be used for grout cleaning now, a task that this is obviously not as well suited for - for everything else though this is way better.",One
mdkxp,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell does it again!,Canada,29-Sep-16,CrossWave,,"For a while now, my household has relied on Bissell products as the workhorses for cleaning. We use a PowerGroom for our carpet vacuuming needs, and a SpotBot on carpet in the event of a spill or whatever. And now, we use the CrossWave to clean our hardwood kitchen floor, previously a task attempted infrequently via mop and bucket...The way I look at the CrossWave is it's a bit like a gentler, upright version of the SpotBot - a sort of hybrid of that and a regular stick vacuum. Like the SpotBot, it has one tank for the cleaning solution / water mix, and another for the dirty water that it sucks back up during the cleaning process. All the pieces snap in and out of place with ease, so cleanup is not a hassle. It even comes with a little drying rack to put the mop/brush roller in after you wash it.It was advertised as being safe for hardwood floors. This thing doesn't use steam, and that's why - it's like an electric mop combined with a vacuum. So, we got it in hopes of cleaner kitchen floors. It did not disappoint! After even just the first use, my floor looked cleaner than it's ever been. Even though the machine isn't all that loud, it must be doing a ton of work under there, since even though we scrub and mop often, it picked up a ton of dirt from the floor... Likely most of it came from our 3-year old, who, for the longest time, loved to throw things on the floor (and still does, at times). All you need to do is push a button on the handle to turn it on for hard floors or carpet, and then squeeze the trigger while you move it around to use the cleaning solution. I haven't used any similar product with as much maneuverability as this, thanks to the pivoting head design, which feels great in use.It sucks up most of the solution, even on carpet. I've used a commercial carpet cleaner, which I'm sure does a much better job, but they're not cheap to rent and they left my carpets wet for a long time. The CrossWave left my carpet damp, but it didn't seem to last very long. My carpet is very short carpet, mind you. I don't know how it would compare if you have shag or even medium-length rugs.My wife loves it just as much as I do, because it's so much faster than a mop (takes about half the time), it can do more than a mop, and more convenient. She is the one who got us using Bissell back when we had ferrets as pets (if you know ferrets at all, then you likely know how the SpotBot would be a lifesaver!), so this is just another indication that she was on the right track, as we've gradually replaced other brands with Bissell products. The only thing she doesn't like is the scent of the included solution, so she is thinking of finding an alternative. That's not a knock on the product at all - I think it smells pleasant - she just doesn't like scents in general.I know this sounds like I'm a Bissell fanboy, but... Well, I can't deny it. I kinda am. Regardless, this thing performs, and is an easy recommend.",
c-money,2.0 out of 5 stars,I’d rather mop.,Canada,26-Oct-18,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"Vacuum is only mediocre suction, and the moping function about the same.Maybe it saves time, but if so, not very much! My regular Miele vacuum is far more powerful, and easier to use.  A sponge mop does a better job cleaning the floor, and also easier to use. With a regular mop, I can pick the cleaning solution to use. (Pet friendly)Add the extra time maneuvering this, and the extra passes I needed to make to clean the floor, and the time to clean this when I was done, and I don’t think I was any further ahead versus doing 2 separate steps.I wanted to like it, but can’t.",2
Dean,2.0 out of 5 stars,Borderline Useless at Cleaning,Canada,19-Jan-19,CrossWave,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this as a potential solution to both vacuum and wash my floors. I have a generally small and clean condo which I clean weekly. There is typically some dust accumulation, some spots on the floor, maybe a boot mark or two. Previously I was just using a Swiffer WetJet, but I thought that the CrossWave would offer some help by cleaning my 2 area rugs and washing the floor in the same go. I was very wrong. The CrossWave did nothing but wet then smear dust all over, the brush is out about 1"" from the wall so it creates a very distinct line of dirt.

Ailsa S,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Has some great and innovative features but best used for smaller, lightly soiled floors and rugs,",Canada,14-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"I received this product free of charge in return for testing and evaluating it in my home and writing an honest review.This household appliance is described as:-Vacuums and washes your floors at the same time-Multi-surface machine cleans both sealed hard floors and area rugs-Dual-action Multi-Surface brush roll that uses an innovative microfiber and nylon brush to mop and pick up dry debris at the same time-Two-tank system keeps cleaning solution and dirty water separate to ensure that you're always cleaning with a fresh mix of water and Formula-Smart-touch controls on the handle allow you to easily switch between cleaning hard floors and area rugs and control your solution with an on-demand solution trigger.This is an accurate description of the product, The Bissel 1785A CrossWave Multi-Surface Cleaner.The box was well packed and the machine arrived safely. It assembled quickly and fairly easily although I had to push the handle in a bit harder than I'd thought. It didn't click in at first since I was being too gentle for fear I might break it - no worries though, it's very sturdy. Mine was corded and there was plenty of length to do the room with only one change of plug receptacle. I inserted the fluid filled container and it leaked all over my waxed hardwood floors.  (Note to self: Read the manual thoroughly and find your glasses before doing it. ) That bit of the hardwood floor looked great though! It has two easily seen and accessible settings: 'Rug' and 'hard floor' the latter covering sealed wood, tile, linoleum etc. The rug setting lights up when it comes on. You have to step down on the top-left of the base of the machine to release the handle.I tried it first on my large country ceramic tiled kitchen floor. I purposely let the floor get really dirty. We trod on it all day to grind the dirt in.  I had been cooking, making jam all day, and there were sticky bits of that dropped when filing the jars and I let the dogs walk over it all as well. They tracked dirt in from outside and added to the mix.  After emptying about two thirds of the larger setting  amount of fluid, the two by three foot tile floor section still wasn't clean. Then as the manual suggested, for challenging messes such as my floor, I used the rug setting and small back and forth movements.This was much better, got all but the really stuck on ground-in bits. However it also left brush marks about an inch or so apart (from the beater action I am guessing) since they were blurred due to the intensity of the dirty water- even at the start of the job. The machine also began leaving grey muddy fluid on the tile. I checked the manual and found this meant the dirty water container needed to be dumped out and replaced. I thought that was pretty quick for such a small section but my floor was an extreme challenge for any cleaner.  It also used much more cleaning solution than the hard floor.By this time I had used a half of the sample bottle of cleaner and the small dirty water return receptacle (it only holds two cups) was completely full by this time, although there was cleaning solution left in that receptacle at the back of the machine which holds more. The chemical fluid does have a lighter fresher  smell than some others but I really didn't like the chemical aspect since I've not used chemical cleaners in years. Others would find it pleasant would be my guess.I had also left crumbs and little bits of things dropped (cat kibble, sugar) to see if it would vacuum those up as it cleaned and it did - great feature!  I also liked the fact that the head swiveled.My easy-clean tile floors are really shiny, a gloss rather than a semi-matte finish and this left them dull, which meant there was residue on them - not ideal for a toddler to play on despite the manual saying the fluid is safe for children and pets. I don't think I'd so so without going over it again with vinegar and water.  I obviously couldn't continue cleaning since there were grey muddy water streaks everywhere.  It needed to be emptied. This took time and interrupted the job for several minutes. It also left streaks.However - it has an ingenious method of cleaning the brush in situations just like this. You fill the receptacle the machine rests on between cleanings with tepid water, tilt the machine toward you and run the 'hard floor' setting for several seconds with the brush spinning until the fluid is gone.  This may be repeated as necessary.  Thrilled  with that feature. Anything that saves me time and aggravation is my friend. I absolutely loved this! Wish every mop had it.Emptying the dirty water was fairly easy but for a larger floor with heavier dirt I could see it was going to be often and it was, to my annoyance. I put the machine on its drying rack before continuing and washed the brush as directed (tickled with that) since the manual said to do that, but it took a few times. For most lightly soiled floors it would be once or twice max.  I tried it on other areas of the floor and it performed best and had to be emptied much less often on the less soiled areas.As I said, it was great on hardwood. However mine is the older waxed kind and not sealed in some spots due to heavier use, so I didn't know if it was safe to continue. Again, the finish is dull and that area had to be buffed back to its original sheen.Cleaning the rug was a marathon of dirty water receptacle emptying. I've got a cat and two dogs and the receptacle was constantly clogged with hair from the rug when cleaning. It did do a nice job, but again I didn't like the chemical smell in the fibers. It is labelled as safe for family and pets. The ingredients are listed as: Greater than 30% water, less than 5% nonionic surfactants (most being non-toxic), which  enable the cleaning solution to wet surfaces for quicker cleaning, detergent builders (generally non-toxic, used in detergents and cleaners), sodium polyacrylate (a water absorbent found in disposable diapers, hair gel, personal lubricants and many others), fragrance, methylisothiazolinone, benzothiazolone, hexyl cinnamal and coumarin.Is it non-toxic though? Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) is allergenic and cytotoxic according to  a report released in 2014 by the European Commission Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety and this has led to some concern over its use.  Contact dermatitis is one effect reported:  I don't think I'd let a baby crawl on the carpet after using this despite what the label says.Another ingredient in the formula is benzothiazolone, which is considered hazardous by the 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) . However, in the tiny amounts in this cleaning formula the risk would be minimal although one I decline to take for babies and toddlers.Hexyl cinnamal, another ingredient,  is found naturally in the essential oil of chamomile and used in the manufacture of perfume and cosmetics, fabric softeners etc . It is  considered non-toxic although it is known to cause contact allergies in some individuals but the rate of incidence is low, with patch tests indicating  <0.1% of people to be susceptible.Coumarin is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys in animal studies although it is only somewhat dangerous to humans. In the tiny amounts in this cleaning fluid toxicity would be minimal or absent if not ingested by a child.It's up to the consumer to decide to use the cleaner, do more research before making  decision or check with the manufacturer to see it your own fluid can be used instead. My guess is that they would probably want to sell you the fluid but it''s worth a try.Following use, the machine has to be disassembled and cleaned, according to the manual, and here is where the whole process lost me. It was just too time consuming and took much more time and work than actually cleaning the floor.1. You must release the dirty water tank - easy and quick.2. Pour dirty water and debris out. (It shows dumping it in the sink but I used the toilet)3. Rinse the inside of the tank4. Pull the filter out and rinse and hand wash filter and separate screen with mild detergent (I used dish liquid)5. Rinse the float at the bottom of the dirty water tank6. Clean the area of the machine where the dirty water tank sits7. Grasp brush roll window at the front of the machine and8. Pull brush roll out (easy)9. Rinse the brush and the roll window under the tap10. Clean the brush roll chamber with a cloth11.  Leave parts out to dry before reassemblingThe floor rest has an addition that allows you to air dry the brush upright.Since I had to empty the tank several times for each floor, I just dumped the dirty water out and replaced it without all the cleaning and rinsing and left it to the end of the job. Refilling the clean water tank was difficult since I had to pull it hard straight up to get it out and it didn't want to budge. I had to put one foot on the top of the machine base for leverage and yanked it out and was afraid I might damage it. I nearly fell over with the effort when it came out. Maybe with use it would get easier. For arthritic hands, this was a real pain.As I cleaned, I rinsed the brush in the tray as directed several times throughout the job (great feature). This would be less for a small, lightly soiled floor. I let all parts dry before doing each other floor type although it says you can do more than one floor type in a single session.I'm just not willing to put all that time and effort into cleaning my floors despite the desirable features I mentioned. Inserting a tank containing my own non-toxic fluid onto a stick-type mop with a removable pad that can be tossed into the washer after use is what works for me. I also like the freedom of not needing to drag a cord around as I'm cleaning and the manual one consumes no electricity. The downside is it these don't vacuum up water and debris as you clean, which is a great feature of the Bissel Cross Wave.This would be best suited for lightly soiled smaller floors and those willing to take the time to empty and fill the receptacles and rinse and replace all the parts and who aren't concerned about using chemical cleaning fluid. It does do exactly what is says it does.Pros:- Vacuums and washes at the same time- Does different floor types- Picks up debris such as cat litter, crumbs, spilled rice and cereal etc. as it cleans- Cleans its brush right on its floor rest throughout the job as necessary- The head swivels a bit for ease and maneuverability- Has a floor rest with a projection that holds the removed brush to dry uprightCons:-The biggest is that it is just too time and labour consuming to use daily.- The dirty water receptacle is way too small and needs to be emptied constantly for larger floors and especially rugs- The parts must be disassembled and cleaned after every use to maintain the machine- It leaves a dull and streaky finish on gloss ceramic tile- The cleaning fluid, despite the claims as pet and family safe, is not something I am willing to risk using although people use other household cleaners regularly with no effect and I'm sure this is as fine. The machine also uses an awful lot of fluid for each floor especially on the rug setting.Due to this and despite some features I really love, I have to give it a three. My feedback for the manufacturer would be to make a cordless version with a much larger dirty water receptacle and make safer cleaning fluid or suggest consumers use their own non-toxic fluid.",36

Fuel,3.0 out of 5 stars,it doesn't vacuum as well as a good vacuum and it doesn't mop as well as a ...,Canada,14-Oct-16,CrossWave,,"The Bissel 1785A CrossWave is an average vacuum and an average mop, it doesn't vacuum as well as a good vacuum and it doesn't mop as well as a regular mop and bucket. I believe that most people would be better suited to using this as a carpet cleaner rather than a whole house vacuum / mop as it just doesn't have the power to do the heavy work if you're a pet owner. On the first usage it did produce a rather dark looking liquid but that is because the area rug I used was particularly dirty as I don't often steam mop my rugs and only vacuum them so it succeeded in the part however on wooden floors it didn't seem to clean them very well if they weren't vacuumed in advance causing me to have to go over the same spot several times.The few benefits this product has are it's weight and it's ability to easily clean carpeted surfaces, as a vacuum or a mop I would recommend a regular vacuum in combination with either a standard mop & bucket or a swiffer wet system as you will get better results for less using that in comparison to if you bought this.The weight of this is light enough that I was able to use it with my broken shoulder blade which limited my usage of it to a single arm.",8

ShoeAddict,2.0 out of 5 stars,I had high hopes...,the United States,21-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I live in a multi-cat home and have dark hardwood floors throughout. My typical cleaning regimen was robot vacuum during the week, then weekends I would manually vacuum and then steam mop. Very time consuming, but it worked. When my steam mop died, I saw this product and thought it would be great to cut my time about in half. Unfortunately I'm really not a fan. The vacuum suction is great, but I've used 3 times now and have found that less than midway through cleaning I am getting streaks of dirty water. I tried stopping and emptying out that chamber (even though it's not full) and rinsing the brush with water in the tray as recommended, but then a few minutes back at it and it's happening again. I also have to scrape clumped wet hair and litter from the bottom of the broom a few times during cleaning. And this is just cleaning my open floor plan kitchen/living room/dining room, not the whole house. Also, because there is one chamber that collects both the liquid and the dry mess, it is incredibly gross to clean out. I had litter and hair mixed with dirty water and I have to use my hands to get it all out. Pouring it in the sink seems gross to me but the alternative is toilet or outside so I've been pouring as much liquid in the sink and then the wet solids in the trash and then have to sterilize the sink. I think a separate chamber for liquid and solid would be ideal but not sure if that can be designed! I feel like I can't really return it since I've used it so I plan to use the vacuum part of it and then just steam mop after like I used to. This is an excellent premise, but it really doesn't work for me.UPDATE: I have now had this for another month of use and am still not happy. I thought maybe it wasn't for cat houses but see other reviews where it works for cats. I feel like the small amounts of litter particles on the floor end up getting wet and clumping (as litter does) on the bottom of the vacuum so every 5-10 minutes I need to stop and get a paper towel to scrape away wet clumps of hair mixed with a little litter. And I get dirty water streaks on the floor right off the bat, so it's not like it's clogging after a while of use.  It happens with rinsed out parts/brush and empty debris compartment. Maybe mine has a defect so I do plan to call. It's really frustrating to spend an hour or two cleaning and then having floors streaked with dirty water.",700
Caroline,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT DURABLE,the United States,2-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Purchased the BISSELL Crosswave Pet Pro All in One Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop on August 17, 2018. Machine ceased to spray cleaning solution on November 2, 2018. After attempting troubleshooting instructions unsuccessfully, I contacted Bissell Consumer Care. The customer service representative located in the Philippines was courteous, but there was a lot of loud talking & laughing background noise which was very unprofessional. The rep suggested I repeat the troubleshooting instructions which I did to no avail. She offered an address of a certified Bissell repair representative that was 45 minutes away from my home. I explained that this solution was unacceptable and the customer service rep offered to email me an address label to ship my machine back to Bissell where it could be inspected by their team. If the machine is deemed defective, Bissell will ship me a replacement within 3 business days after their determination.

Mitzi Rose,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Good The Bad and The Ugly(smelly),the United States,27-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,,"I have decided now that I've had my Cross Pro for about a year I should give you the Good the Bad and the Ugly about this machine.Did you ever wonder why your grout is dirty even though you mop it all the time? It's obviously with a regular mop. It's because you are putting the dirty water over top of very porous material. Grout is very porous. Unless you want to scrub grout after you mop with a toothbrush scooting around on your butt, it's always going to look dirty. This is where I believe the Cross Pro really shines and worth the money. Instead of draggin dirty water over your grout you're sucking it up and not leaving it in the grout. I have two dogs. One doesn't shed at all and the other one sheds enough for three dogs! I mop my floors once a week with the Cross Pro. I could almost make a new dog out of what is vacuumed up into the machine tank. So those are the good I find in the Cross Pro. Now for the bad ... my opinion. It's nearly impossible to get all of the dog hair out of the machine. There's the obvious parts that you can wash and in many cases you better soak or it's going to stink the next time you use it. I guess it's the wet hair sticking inside the tubes that you don't have access to but that can stink! You know the smell of wet dog hair that's dirty? That's pretty much it. That's actually the ugly in my good bad and ugly opinion.I do not see any reason whatsoever to use the products they recommend to use with the machine. Very expensive and not necessary. It's also my opinion that the soft water or the osmosis water in your sink if you have it, is perfectly fine.  As I said I've used mine for a year. The most important thing is cleaning this unit every time you finish using it. If you don't, you'll know that smell I was talking about immediately! Now would I buy this machine again? YES! I would. I have a pet peeve with dirty grout.As for carpet, I dont use it on my carpet. Just my tile.",316

Raspberry,4.0 out of 5 stars,I’m in love 😍,the United States,23-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,,"This really works! I have pugs, two have incontinence issues and all of them are absolute slobs. I love them all dearly but they are very messy and leave fur anywhere they go. Constantly kicking up dirt and grass outside and tracking it back into the house. Knocking pet food out of their bowls and submerging their entire faces into dog water bowls. Sloshing thick dog drool water around the area with there jowls. It gets overwhelming trying to keep up. This Crosswave has saved my sanity! It is so quick and easy compared to what I have been trying to accomplish with a vacuum, broom, Bona mop and other cleaning products. This has cut my cleaning time in half at least! It takes care of it all!  I cleaned an area rug tonight that I have vacuumed yesterday with a Hoover canister vacuum and OMG I was grossed out and shocked how much came off of it!! Now it smells wonderful too and dried in just a minute! I am so very happy.My only concern is that this doesn’t feel like something that will last a very long time. I appreciate that it is fairly light and easy to handle, but plastics make me nervous and I am glad it comes with a five year warranty.I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought it from manufacturers website and got a promotional deal with extra brushes. That being said I felt compelled to give a review here on amazon while I pick up some solutions for my new best friend 😉",227
Jennifer Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product.,the United States,6-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I actually have two already.  I bought on e about 9 months ago and loved it so much that., when I was traveling in my RV, I ordered one and picked it up on the go.  It is a great, wonderful thing. My lab sheds and it makes it so much easier than sweeping and then mopping. Then I saw the pet pro one. I bought it as well. I’m giving my aunt the first one and keeping the pet one. I have tile and laminate in the house and it’s a big house. But I don’t mind using this. It’s easy, it works, and cleans the floors quite well. Yes, I have to use a wipe in some places - in the bathroom where the cross wave doesn’t fit. But I really recommend this item.",165
Crystal Higgins,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product.......one teenie, tiny flaw. Not enough to stop me from buying another as a gift for my Mom and my sister.",the United States,20-May-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love everything about how it vacuums and mops the floors and how easily it switches from hard floor to area rug. My only wish is that the soap/water container was a little larger. I am filling it up more often that I think should be necessary.,130
Wayne E. Hucks,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy,the United States,24-Feb-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Do not buy this product... it is a waste of money.  I bought for my household to use 3mo ago and noticed no one is using.  They informed me it leave streaks AND after so many passes the coverage liquid coverage on roller minimizes so only 1/2 or less of the roller is getting any solution at all.  I cleaned all parts myself and it still did the same thing.  Due to the time lapse, Bissell will NOT refund my money.  This was a HUGE waste of $300 and I would not even give this to a family member.  I never write reviews, but I will be posting negative ones on this product anywhere I can find a spot to save everyone else in this heartache.  This was the biggest piece of crap I've ever purchased in my life!!!!!",94
Marie W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The people have spoken- the ratings on this machine don't lie!,the United States,30-May-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Unbelievable. The RATINGS didn't lie. We own Vacation Rental properties some we allow pets, some we don't. A lot of wood and tile floors both of which bring their own sets of issues. ( Wood scratch marks, tile-grout issues ) Carpet is just carpet. BUT THE THROW rugs!  We have to get them all professionally cleaned every 6 to 8 months. They just matt down and start to look faded. No vacuum sweeper gets it all.  We used the Bissell CROSSWAVE pet pro on one of our 8 by 10 floor rugs. ( Hardest one to clean ) IT looks brand NEW. ( Mind you we normally have it professionally cleaned ) This little machine gets down into the nap and some how manages to get all those fibers to stand-at-attention once again. Its been over a month and the travel over that rug is huge, it still looks like new. ( It's close to 5 years old ) We used the Bissell on tile and it not very wide, so we have to go back and forth a couple of times over the same area for cleaning but it picks up and drys very fast when applying water solution. We chose to go with the Public Ratings posted and those whom have been using this Crosswave were not kidding, this vacuum really works like a champion dry or wet. They should have named it the Champ!",97
James Bisek,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good suction,the United States,17-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I liked the suction and cleaning with clean water instead of dirty mop.

Lindsey B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, cleans up after our pets and toddler very nicely!",the United States,28-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So like many I have looked at lots of products and used many large clunky carpet cleaners that have never truly worked. Bought this about 2 months ago and I love it. I mean I still grab my shark floor vacuum to daily vacuuming because I hate cords and my swifter for small spills but I do truest love this machine. Like every carpet cleaner you have to fill with purified water( we have well so our jugged water) and used cleaner solution so it’s takes a little bit to get started and set up for me. Also this has no thermal unit so you have to use warm water. But I pull it out for when I clean the whole house. This is usually every week to 2 weeks. I cleaned all of our area rugs and my laminate floors/ tile floors and it vacuums and cleans very well. Also smells good! We have 2 dogs and a toddler so I am grateful! Today was a great example. My dog puked on our shagg rug, five minutes later it was clean and white again! Also just one last thing the dry time is so much better for area rugs with this thing, it never leaves them too wet so like 1-2 hours they are dry vs. almost 8-10 with the big carpet cleaners. Clean/ dirty water tanks are a little small but it helps keep it light weight so no complaining on my side!",72
Book Buff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans Better Than a Robot,the United States,4-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I happened to buy both the iRobot Braava jet 240 Robot Mop and the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro All in One Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop for Hard Floors and Area Rugs, 2306A, the same week.  So, I went over my entryway tile with the Braava jet in damp mode (my tiles don't like ""wet') and it picked up some dirt.  Then I went over the same area again using the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro -- and the Bissell picked up more dirt and grime left behind by the Braava jet than the Braava jet did getting ""first shot"" at the job.  Still, the Braava jet is good for a little light damp dusting without much work on your part, if that is what you need.  The Bissell feels more like using a traditional upright vacuum -- although there is more clean-up of the machine necessary when you are done than using an upright vacuum -- kind of like cleaning up a carpet cleaner machine.  Bottom line: if I had to do it again, I would only buy the Bissell because it cleans much better!",81
Marvin Lipschitz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I will never use a mop again. This thing is totally awesome!,the United States,10-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This saves time.  I just used this for the first time. I am not a patient person. The first time using this was the easiest I have ever vacuumed and mopped a floor.  I also have never had a cleaner tile floor. Clean up was complete and easy. It essentially cleans it self. Also, given the huge area I cleaned I didn’t even use the whole tank, which is by the way very small. Generally my cleaning people would use a lot of pinesol (or similar product) and the floor still didn’t get that clean. No residue. The amount of provided pet solution is plenty for several cleanings. I recommend only filling the water to the lower level first or you will feel forced to clean your whole house the first time you try it. If thing breaks one day past the warranty period. I will buy another right away, Even if the warranty was short. But, this thing also has a three year warranty.  The first time I cleaned it I took a video. It could be an infomercial.  Even Lewis Black, my favorite comedian, would not be frustrated by this device.",76
Lauren B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible Machine!!,the United States,23-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Long read but worth it if you're questioning this purchase!!!My single floor 1500 sq ft home is 90% hardwoods. I have two dogs and two kids (young boys), and a baby on the way. One dog is a husky mix that sheds incessantly. The dirt tracked in from the backyard on a daily basis is insane here. I needed a better solution to the dirty floors because 1. gross, and 2. babies crawl and stick everything in their mouths!I have had this vacuum one week. I have used it 3x and in those times I have sucked up: 6 eggs that were spilled from my 5 year old wanting to make his own breakfast, piles and piles of dog fur, muddy paw prints, muddy foot prints, and 4 furry dirty high trafficked rugs. My first time using the vacuum I spent 3 hours deep cleaning to get a good initial baseline on its abilities.Y'all I was SHOCKED at how dirty the water was. I was amazed at its suction power on my rugs (all the fur was GONE), and how well it functioned going from rug to hardwood. It sucked up EVERYTHING. I had to clean it about 5 times that first deep clean because of all the fur (and raw eggs, yuck). To clean it out takes 5 minutes, and you're back to cleaning. I also filled the tank 3x, and had my hand on the trigger almost the whole time I vacuumed.I covered every inch of my home that wasnt carpeted. Including a tiled bathroom and a linoleum floored bathroom. This machine didn't FLINCH. After cleaning all the floors I wiped up some water drops and the paper towel wasnt dirty!Overall it's easy to maneuver, easy to clean out (it comes completely apart where dirty water and debris goes), and it ACTUALLY CLEANS. My floors haven't felt this great since we installed them 2 years ago. I used the multipurpose cleaner samples they sent, and loved them. I also appreciate that you can use whatever cleaning solution you desire, and the extra roller. I was wary spending this much on a vacuum, but this competes with an old school rainbow vacuum AND it mops at the same time.Today I tested it out dry first and sucked up the fur on the floor THEN put in the tank and mopped. Much easier cleanup and it didn't fill up the dirty tank or plumbing near as fast doing a dry vac first.Goodbye swifter style mop, and hello actual clean floors!! If you're hesitant DONT BE, you will thank yourself and bissel for a fantastic product. Just keep it clean and let all the parts air dry when done, and you'll have a happy vacuum and a wonderfully clean home.I will update over the next 6 months to a year and see how its holding up. I hope this lasts for years to come.",38
dio,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sucks real good.,the United States,15-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Very ineffective. Wouldn’t remove the most basic of traffic. I really wanted to like my purchase. I was blind to it sucking, until my wife gave me “the look”, then I snapped out of it. It cleans itself well and is easy to assemble, but simply doesn’t get the job done. I spent all day inching across my kitchen floor, waisting 3 hours of my life. When I tried to return it, I had trouble disassembling the long handle that was easy to assemble. To remove it, one would have to void the warranty to get to the screw. I assume this was intentional. I’m happy with my new steam mop.",69
J. smith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Are you kidding?????,the United States,29-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Having been a Cavalier breeder for over 10 years, I've had some pretty extensive experience with hard floor cleaners and their faults and flaws.  In the beginning, the only product available in this cleaning machine line was a Hoover Floormate.  I've had MANY of them over the past 10 years.  They do a moderate job of cleaning hard floors and sucking up dirty water and a rather iffy job of sucking up the accompanying hair. (In the beginning)  I know that one should vacuum first then wet clean, but when you have puppy piddles mixed with dog hair, you have no choice but to reverse the order.  The big flaw with the Hoover Floormate is that they don't last!  They are cheap enough, but don't expect them to outlast their warranty.  My experience has been that the motor burns out before warranty and you do get a new one which does the same thing and then you are done.  Start over.  After may years of ""start over"", I have been searching for a better quality machine.  Enter the Bissell Crosswave!  I already had the Bissell Pet vac and mostly am happy with it outside of a few design flaws, and I'm very impressed with its ability to pick up pet hair, so thought I'd give this machine a try.  At twice the price of a Floormate, I was in hopes that it would be a much better quality machine.  Out of the box, I'm terribly disappointed in this product.  I probably should shoot a little video clip to show how it just smears the dirt around with every pass and your have to keep going back, and back, and back over the floor to achieve anything even remotely close to clean. The water retrieval suction is just terrible and is the reason that it tends to smear dirty water around.  AND, just as with the Floormate, it leaves a puddle anywhere you stop.  I have to lift mine over 2 dog gates which accounts for puddles #1 &2 which have to be cleaned up after cleaning.  Then there is the inevitable puddle at the end.  AND, when you read through the clean up instructions and all the steps that they suggest to clean up brushes, tanks, filters and various parts of the machine, it makes you think twice as to whether or not your cleaning job is worth the subsequent machine cleanup, especially since they suggest leaving various parts sit out until dry.....seriously?  UGH!Given that they tout this machine as a ""Pet"" clean up machine, I'm astounded at how poorly ip picks up wet hair.  It truly does a terrible job in the wet suction department.  Have not tried it on area rugs, but that is not what I bought it for and probably will not use it for this purpose.  But as to hard floor clean up,  it gets a big old goose egg from me.  Will most likely send it back.  At twice the price of the Floormate, this definitely is not worth the extra $$$ for me.PS....it is a very heavy machine as well and the water tanks are half the size they should be.",44
Dina ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,the United States,1-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was reluctant to spend the money, but I had tried several other floor cleaners, and none worked. To say my floors are dirty, is an understatement. I have boys running in and out, and 3 dogs, and 2 cats!!! One is a great pyranese and digs giant craters in my back yard of dirt and sand to lay in. They ALL shed!!! The other two dogs have a habit of relieving themselves in the house!!!!  No good deed goes unpunished!  Anyway, the level of filth I deal with everyday is disgusting and exhausting!!  I read all the reviews from other pet owners and figured 600 good reviews, it’s worth a shot.  It was amazing!!! I was blown away at how well this worked!! It’s easy to use and clean. This thing works better than I expected, and exactly as they say!!!",56
Leah Kienke,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves your floor damp and dirty,the United States,30-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,If you want to spend $300 for a vacuum that kind of cleans rugs and leaves the rest of your floors spotty and damp. This is your vacuum. Look no further. I've used this vacuum 3 or 4 times now and its basically worthless. It gets warm and does not turn back on for at least an hour. I was really looking forward to something that worked on hardwood floors and tile and I'm still looking.,50

Looks like that you have to call them and ask for help to return the stuff. This is kind of tricky.-------------I received it today and used right away.  I did have a wonderful experience on 1st floor i did with it. But when i cleaned and use for 2nd floor it started to change sound louder and leaked dirty water on hard floor. If i switch off button and turn on back, it will be ok again. But every 30 secs to 2 mins i have to turn off machine to get it work normally. So i have to return it even i used. In general it's a bad experience because it's down at my first time use.",44
Apiccoli,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changer,the United States,19-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This is a life changer if all your floors are hard surfaces and area rugs. It thoroughly cleaned my aging area rugs and refreshed then back to life and left a nice scent behind with the pet formula I bought for it. It scrubbed my hardwood and tile floors and they dried withing five minutes. (Area rugs were about 20 minutes to dry) the cleaning left a bit to be desired due to all the dog hair from my two dogs but was way easier than vacuuming and mopping all my floors separate without this machine.  The base to clean it helps a lot after wiping out all the dog hair from the dirty water cup and the intake hose to the dirty water cup ( which is about 3 inches long from the roller intake area to the dirty water intake.) Very powerful and simple machine with not a lot of parts to take a part and clean. Feels heavy duty but is lighter than I expected when lifting. I am very satisfied even with the hefty price tag.,42
Marisha,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans well but brush and cord are short,the United States,19-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Overall the cross wave cleans well, the container always has dirt and grim that was picked up during use. The reason I gave 4 stars though is because I wish the brisels on the brush were longer to get into grout lines and clean better on uneven textured tiles. The cord is also shorter than other similar products. For example our steam mop can be plugged in once and reach the entire area needed, the cross wave requires us to unplug and plug into three different outlets to cover the same area.",60
Kristi Greenberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have dogs who love to track in mud and of course shed,the United States,14-Apr-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Just used this vacuum for the first time.

Made cleaning up a breeze and clean up was simple too.",52
AndyGirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Changer!,the United States,8-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I LOVE this mop!  I love that your not sloshing dirty water around everywhere.  I have three dogs and one of them is a German Shedder.  I at first vacuumed before using this as not to clog it or overwhelm it.  But then one day threw my cares into the wind and tried it without vacuuming prior.  It did fantastically.  I do have to change out the water once in order to finish my down stairs but I have a lot of tile.Today our puppy pooped and smashed it in her kennel.  She then escaped and tracked it EVERYWHERE!  I was real worried that using this would just get poop all over the spinner and be counter productive.  Well I tried a 10ft radius and then took the spinner out to see if it was gross.  Rinsing it in the sink the water was barely dirty!  This thing cleans itself!!  I was super impressed!,41
DJW,1.0 out of 5 stars,Clean up is disgusting,the United States,21-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Three things that you should never mix together dirt, dog hair and water!  The concept is great, but the clean up is disgusting.  I wish I could return it.",44
Bralyee10,3.0 out of 5 stars,Beats Mopping,the United States,10-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have a German Shepard mix and a Belgian Malnois and they both shed like crazy. During the rainy season my floors are hard to keep clean and I have to constantly sweep and mop. I got sick of bending over or tossing out dirty mop buckets so I got this based off reviews and a friend's recommendation. I use a Dyson, which works phenomenally by the way, to do my carpets so I can't give an opinion on its carpet use only on tile(wood tile specifically). To say that it ""wow'd"" me would be a stretch but it did do the job. I had to clean out the dirty water tank once although the instructions make it appear it should last for at least 800 square feet if you're using a larger volume of water/cleaner. If you have a home at least 1500 sq feet plan on changing the water tank at least twice. I am not dissatisfied with the cleaner itself I just don't think it's worth the money. When it comes down to it, its an overpowered mop. You still have to change the water and clean it immediately afterwards to keep it in good condition.",25
MikeInWeston,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good post-renovation cleaner,the United States,23-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We are cleaning up new tile floors after major renovation which included popcorn ceiling removal, so will be dealing with dust for a long time. So far this has worked well, sucking up the dust, splinters, screws, wires, etc. and mopping up any dust left over. I recommend this product.Be sure to hold the trigger down long enough to saturate the roll or it will streak. The pet roll might have something to do with this since the bristles are fairly stiff, but we didn't read directions (of course) and wondered what was wrong until we realized that the roll was not wet enough.We do not have pets. Just in case you are wondering which to order, I ordered the more expensive pet version even though I understand the green ""normal"" version has a higher RPM brush and is less expensive, because of our challenges. As I understand it, this has a little better 'trapping' of hair so I am hoping it has the same effect on leftover construction materials (screws, wires, splinters, etc.). I'm not certain because haven't compared machines, but I think we made the right choice for our situation. After reviewing the material and reading reviews of each I don't think you can go wrong with either.",29
Happy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but does not clean grout or standard carpet well",the United States,13-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I like it, the only reason I gave it an overall 4 out 5 stars is the fact it does not get into the grout. If it had a stronger brush that would scrub the grout. It works great on area rugs, but cleaning or even spot cleaning on standard rugs does not meet my expectation. It’s easy to disassemble for cleaning and easy to assemble for use.  It’s definitely lightweight and easy to use. Works great for rainy days with mud being tracked into our home.",33
Garden Lori,1.0 out of 5 stars,POS update! 12/26/19,the United States,28-Oct-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"*Update 12/26/19*Great product until it wasn’t. Right at the one year mark it completely stopped working. Took it to my local authorized Bissell repair shop. Nothing was covered and it cost me $120 for the repair for a $300 product!  Go figure, some parts damaged by ... get ready for it... water! It’s a wet vac! HELLO! Got it home and it worked like a champ... until it didn’t.  One week later NO SUCTION! Back to the shop. This time I was told the way the brush spins it send the dirt to the sides of the brush to be sucked up. Great. But it also causes debris to lodge in the spindle that runs the brush and made it seize up and burned out the motor. Repair shop wants another $60 (their cost) for the part. I have almost $500 invested in a really good boat anchor.  Buyer beware. This is not a well engineered product and really not made for daily use if you have pets (Pet Pro) Hoodwinked by Bissell. Shame on Bissell!!!This product has saved me so much moo time and headaches. I have 2 small dogs a 2 cats and it works so well. I find the best cleaning solution to use is the “multi-surface pet”. It has only a few parts to clean and I toss the brush (it came with 2) into wash with the pet towels and it comes out fine. You have to keep the brush clean and the under carriage or it will streak the floors. Not really a hassle if you empty and rinse well after use. I do this outside as I am not clogging my plumbing with pet hair. It’s quicker than a mop and bucket and works 10x better. It gets up to the baseboards. The solution smells fresh and clean and goes a long way. By far one of the best household purchases I’ve made in a long time. I also had a leak under my sink and used this wet vac for cleanup.",29
Ryanna Langkamp,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cut clean time in half!,the United States,9-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Quick run down of the background here: I have about 1000sqft of tile/hard wood in my home. I also have a macaw, two cockatiels, and a dog who happens to enjoy shedding more than anything in the world.I don't typically review but wanted to for this since I read so many on both sides, and put off this purchase for months because I was terrified to hate it.I have used my crosswave twice, and I think in some ways there is a bit of a learning curve to getting the most out of it. All in all, I LOVE this and I don't say that lightly. We vacuum daily but, with all of the animals typically deep cleaning takes a few hours, as you vacuum, mop, move furniture, vacuum again, mop, repeat. Then you never fail to wind up with wet dog hair that she must have magically transferred onto the floor you've just cleaned 3 times :| This takes away all of that.Today, I tested for time and it took me 35 minutes to clean the entire house, including the time required to disassemble and clean the crosswave!I can't speak for anyone else but wanted to touch on some of the reviews I've read that had me questioning, and give my experience on them:-Poor Suction?At first I could see this and worried, but after some trouble shooting it occurred to me that, the suction just isn't as great when the handle is all the way leaned back, since the head lifts up from the floor a bit. This might be a bit of a design flaw I suppose, but once you figure it out? Smooth sailing.-Smelly to clean?Nah. I mean, think of it like a carpet cleaner except for hard floors. I imagine it might be bad if you leave it in there for a while but, under no circumstances would I use this and not it right after. It's simple enough.-Clogging?To be clear, I do clean up big things before I vacuum such as bird feathers, but I don't pre-clean and there is a LOT of dog hair. I suppose it could get clogged up but I haven't experienced this.-Spot cleaning?Ok, so I get this issue. I spot clean often (Birds are gross), so I don't typically have many dried up spills on the floors. Spots like right in front of the stove I have to go over a couple times, but they usually come up. If not, they've been so small that to me, it isn't a big deal to spray some cleaner and wipe them up. I don't think it spot cleans any worse than my steam mop or swiffer by any means.-Streaky?This I can also see. I have textured tile in most of the house so it isn't really a big deal to me as you can't see streaks. I feel like usually when I slow down the streaking eases up. I noticed that sometimes because it works similar to a vacuum I tend to move quickly and not consider the time needed to suck up the water. Again, think of it like a carpet cleaner but for hard floors.**I've also never used this for wet spills, and I don't know that I ever would. I'm not really in the business of making a mess of a mop for a job that could be easily done with paper towel and a squirt bottle, so I can't comment on that.All in all, I think it's worth every penny if it is for you. I don't know that it would benefit someone who didn't have a lot of hard flooring, and may be so-so on super textured floors such as stone with large divots. I don't think this would really replace a vacuum for anyone full time, but love it for once a week cleaning.Huge Pros for me:-The long cord. After reading reviews I opted for corded and am so glad I did, plus the cord is so long I rarely have to transfer it.-The head maneuvers from side to side well.-Makes the house smell wonderful!-Good over-all clean in a time saving way.-This fits under my short cabinets! I was so worried it wouldn't as my Dyson Cyclone doesn't!Cons:-You HAVE to clean it after every use, which only takes a few minutes but would be awful otherwise.-If you don't move slow, it WILL leave water streaks.-It does suction worse when the handle is too far extended.-There aren't measurements available for the head height of this anywhere online-The filter takes a few days to dry if inside. However once it was a nice enough day I put it into the sun and it dried in hours.Hope this helps someone, because I know I was up in the air for a long time!",12
Susan H.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough power. Shuts off all the time.,the United States,19-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This is just not powerful enough. I own another Bissell rug shampooer and it's awesome! I don't think the motor on this vac can handle more than 10 minutes at a time because it just shuts off. Then you have to wait for it to cool down till you can run it again. I think there is something very wrong with this machine but Bissell says I have to keep the waste container cleared all the time. It's maybe 1/4 full when I clear it. I am not happy with this product at all and I wish Bissell reads this so they can think about boosting the power in future models. I feel like I spent a ton of money on a product that won't just won't last.,30
Kelsey Chandler-Bird,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Moly — Lifechanger,the United States,19-Jul-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I am so glad I got this! It’s the perfect combination of the small pet vac and electric mop I was already using, but cuts out the time it takes to do both, plus not having to worry about if I miss something while vacuuming!I have 2 dogs and a crawling baby, plus severe dust allergies. So keeping my floors clean and more importantly mopped are a big deal. 99% of the time I can find the time to vacuum but never make it to mopping and then my floors look gross for days and days. This took me about the same amount of time as usual with my electric mop but used less water. It even cleaned up spots on one of my area rugs without tons of water and passes over the spots.After I was finished I was able to very easily remove and rinse all of the parts so that it stays clean... and the amount of crud it picked up was... well disgusting, but in the best way possible!When I did a walk through after I was pleasantly surprised with how clean my floors were! Love it!!!",42
Raquel J,4.0 out of 5 stars,Tips Below:),the United States,30-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I waited to write a review so it would be an more of an exercised one. I wanted something that would make moping easier because I am a pregnant mom with a toddler. I found out that this could vacuum and mop at the same i thought it could be too god to be true. I wanted to find out for myself.We just moved into our new home when it got delivered so with moving boxes in and going In and out of the house the floor was pretty dirty by the end.I vacuumed/mopped the kitchen and dining area first. Then after I finished those areas it started making like a turbo sound and I didn’t know what it was. I noticed that the soap started to leave suds. We were about to think it was not a good buy. (My husband is a big fan of the mop and bucket) We figured out by reading some reviews from others on a forum that sound means the dirty tank needs to be changed!!!!! You have to change it often if the house hasn’t been cleaned in awhile. When I took out the dirty tank I was amazed with how much it picked upTip #1 clean dirty water tank when it makes a loud turbo soundTip#2 go slower, it’s still faster than sweeping and mopping.

W Ettel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t be more pleased,the United States,7-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to add to my review to state that cleaning this machine was sooo easy. No more gobs of dog hair stuck in the front suction area, just pull it out and rinse or wipe it off. Cleaning the brush as well dirty water container was a breeze! As I state below that I’ve had a few machines in the past but I’ve found the best one and it’s the Bissell crossover!I’ve owned big expensive steam carpet cleaners and commercial floor scrubbers and just got tired of the bulk and weight of those machines so I was absolutely thrilled to see this combo wet/dry machine. It has not disappointed yet. As to all those who complain of it leaving streaks or clumps of hair and than having to clean it out let’s get real. If your floor is that dirty than no “one” machine is going to work for you. Best to go back to vacuuming, than cleaning. To be honest, I was thrilled (although a bit grossed out) to see all the gobs of cat and dog hair getting pulled up by this machine. Perhaps not knowing it’s there is good for some but not me. I’d rather get it all up otherwise, why clean it at all? As far as the reviewer who was trying to clean up kitty litter (really??) There is nothing harder to clean up then wet litter. I always sweep up around the box before getting anything that’s wet near it.I am completely satisfied with my new Bissell and would recommend it to anyone who is realistic about what it is capable of doing. I found it terrific for cleaning after our 2 dogs, 1 cat as well as adequately clean the constant dirt that comes in our home from the dusty Texas hill country.",18
navyblue,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the miracle I was hoping for,the United States,14-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Bissell really pushed this machine through a big blogger and instagrammed campaign a year or two ago and I thought it looked like a great product. Years ago, I'd tried the Floormate which promised something similar, to vacuum and mop at the same time. I tried the Floormate and wasn't impressed. I went back to my trusty Bissell Steam mop and a regular old broom.I watched and waited for this thing to go on sale and it just wouldn't. Not even for Black Friday. Ugh. Instead, I saved up my Amazon gift cards and finally bought it. I was so excited when it arrived!I have engineered hardwoods throughout my entire main floor, as well as tile in the bathrooms and laundry room. There are two big area rugs in the front room and entry way, and then smaller rugs in the kitchen and dining area.I like this thing on the rugs. It isn't a deep clean like a professional, but it gets up an awesome amount of dog hair and dirty water and the rugs definitely look better afterward. I can even use it in small areas of *low pile* wall-to-wall carpeting with good success as well, even though the machine isn't recommended for that.Clean up is really painless, which I think is an important feature. Sometimes a great cleaning tool is such a bear to set up and take apart, that it doesn't get used. But really, this one is pretty cake and I like how everything so far has washed up really nice.As others have mentioned, the machine is LOUD, so just FYI if you are using it at night after kids are in bed, or while a baby is napping.I do not love the job this does on my wood flooring. It's not terrible, and the vacuuming is really nice, but I'm just not wowed by the mopping. It dries a bit streaky but I could live with that... it's just the floors really don't get very clean. I have a darker finish that shows foot prints, dog prints, etc. And this machine just leaves a lot behind. I'm surprised, because I'd think the way the rotating brush is designed would ensure a good job, but I've really not been impressed. It leaves water lines and doesn't handle transitions well. If you're doing say, a small area rug and bump off to do the floors around it, you'll have lines of dirty water all around the rug.I think it does a better job on tile, though if you have huge stretches of tile this isn't going to clean your grout well. I like it okay in my laundry room. But it's not worth having for that one relatively small space.I'm honestly torn on whether or not I should keep it. I could get a better carpet/rug cleaner and go back to the broom + steam mop or broom + microfiber mop I've been using for years and be just fine. It's really too bad this doesn't handle wood floors better.In short, I'd expect more for the price, and kind of have buyers remorse over this purchase. Also, don't be wowed by positive paid reviews by bloggers, vloggers, instagrammers, and ""influencers,"" even if they say their reviews are honest, I don't think they use the item long enough or frequent enough to really give an accurate picture of what you're getting. I highly doubt any of the bloggers who reviewed this originally still use it. *shrug*",16
N. Garza,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy,the United States,4-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Crosswave:My wife wanted this so badly. She Was like a Child on Christmas morning- excited with anticipation.  Yes it can indeed suck up Cheerios, fruit loops, mini wheats, cooked spaghetti, broken crayon tips, small toys, string cheese wrapper and more! HOWEVER it is a much better vacuum than mop. If you want a steam mop buy a steam mop. If you want a vacuum buy a vacuum. If You want a carpet/rug cleaner buy a carpet/rug cleaner. This product is not all in one. Don’t buy this you’ll be as disappointed as she (the child on Christmas morning with new toys and no batteries).",15
MacKenzie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2 replacements, I gave up",the United States,9-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So I love the idea of the product. Unfortunately, the first one I received would never turn on. I called bissell and ran through there ""fix-it"" check list. As nothing worked, I was instructed to return it to Amazon. The problem most likely being a faulty handle. (The vacuum has a handle that ""clicks"" into place and if it doesn't correctly, then it wont turn on). Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy. I received a replacement vacuum and was excited to try it.It worked beautifully! I loved how easy it was to vacuum and mop at the same time. It cleaned my area rugs wonderfully. When I was finished, I cleaned the parts as specified in the instructions and put it away for the next use.Sadly, a week later I went to use it, and it would not turn on AGAIN!! I removed the handle and put it back as instructed but still nothing. The thing has not turned on since.In the end, I think the vacuum is a great idea. However, there is a serious problem with the handle. For $300, it shouldnt be a gamble to get one that works. Luckily, I was able to return the 2nd one to Amazon for a full refund.I will NOT be getting a replacement this time, and I would NOT recommend this product.",18

Can’t believe how dirty the water was.  I went over it a second time for peace of mind.  Easy assembly, no-brainer operation and floor didn’t have to be vacuumed before cleaning.  I am a happy camper.  The floor shines and got the job done in less than half the time, even going over it twice.  I marked it down on durability because of short time I’ve had it.  I can update the review in the future.UPDATE:  This thing is a dream come true.  It totally simplifies cleaning floors. I bought it with some hesitation due to its price, but I’m a believer now.

Angela,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t be fooled by negative reviews! It’s terrific!,the United States,10-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’ve wanted one of these for a while but I got overwhelmed by the negative reviews. Even though I know someone who has one the reviews made me doubt it was worth it. THE REVIEWS ARE WRONG!It cleans amazingly well. No streaks. No wet floors. No clogs. No hair wrapped around the brush. Exactly as irr says it will work is what it does. My floors are amazingly clean with minimal effort. I didn’t sweep or vacuum first and my floors are spotless. Even the spilled and splattered ice tea stains are gone.We have a golden retriever, a long haired Maine coon, and a short haired cat plus my daughter and I both have long hair. It not only cleaned all of the hair up but also all of the dirt and debris that the dog tracks inside from the backyard.My only regret is I didn’t buy it sooner.",7
Kelly Loring,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just click buy now,the United States,10-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Money well spent. This product is worth every bit of hype it is receiving. I was skeptical. Having 4 kids (including a crawler) and 3 dogs, our floors need to be swept daily, probably hourly but I can’t live that life.I have bought so many vacuums and floor cleaners that all promised easy cleaning, high suction, great for pet hair and none delivered like this product has! It really really works! The picture included is of the area in front of my dogs food bowls. You can see after one pass, the huge difference!!We have stone tile, hard wood, laminate and area rugs in our home and the only surface that wasn’t fully clean after use was a high pile area rug.

Hmk1221,4.0 out of 5 stars,100% Recommend!!,the United States,6-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Received the Crosswave yesterday! I’ve been so excited to try this out. We have two kids & two small dogs so we have a lot of traffic in our house and I was so tired of sweeping/vacuuming/mopping and still feeling like our floors weren’t clean after much time consuming work. I was pleasantly surprised with this!-It’s very light! I think it says about 11 pounds. This is SO nice esp for something like this that you have to add water to.-It is SO easy to maneuver. I can get around anything and go under a lot as well. It’s much more flexible than other vacuums we have had. It compares to the Dyson ball vacuum for maneuverability.-It really does clean a lot. It vacuums up SO much. I think that adding the water to the vacuuming process traps the dust a bit better as well. When I emptied the tank the first time after a quick go around the house I was shocked!-It isn’t too loud. It isn’t anywhere near the other 2 vacuums I own currently, another Bissell & a Dyson.-I’ve seen a lot of complaints about cleaning it each time and how it’s time consuming. It literally takes less than 1 minute to clean the canisters and clean the roll. I LOVE the self clean feature!-I chose this one over the cordless because I like to get it really clean and don’t want to have to worry about charging another thing. The cord is long and light to carry, it’s really no big deal!I will keep using it and update this review if needed but so far I love it and would recommend it!!",7
Clarichatts,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome awesome awesome!!! ...but not if you’re a perfectionist.,the United States,3-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The non-perfectionist’s BFF. If you live in a house where the floor is dirty 5 minutes after cleaning it no matter how clean you get it, you are going to LOVE this little guy. I have 2 kids, a husband who loves to build things and work in the yard, a dog, and a brooder full of 2 week old chickens in my dining room. Safe to say my floor might be up there with the dirtiest, and this machine doesn’t bat an eye. It’s amazing for things that a broom just can’t handle like pet hair (and toddler hair) sticky rice, wet crumbs, and pine bedding. It also sucks up dirt and sand like nobody’s business. I can clean my kitchen and dining room in 25 min including pre-sweeping the edges, moving chairs, and taking down the machine. Plus, I’m not getting all hot and sweaty like I used to with the whole sweep then mop situation.Setup is just plugging it in and filling up a water bottle. Or leave your water bottle half full like me so it’s ready to go for small spills. Takedown is simpler than I thought too, and you can do it in any bathroom. Our washroom off the kitchen is tiny, but it does the job and takedown takes me like 2-3 minutes now that I have a rhythm with it. First, rinse the roller by pouring water in the tray, then dump your dirty water in the toilet. Refill the dirty tank with clean water from the sink, swish it and dump it in the toilet again. This method keeps your sink clean. I’m surprised by the number of people saying takedown is a pain. It did take a little longer the first couple times so stick with it and you’ll find the efficiencies. And again I’m NOT a perfectionist so I’m not sitting there trying to get the dirty tank perfectly clean. It has a dirty film after the first few uses and I’m fine with that.You DO have to sweep around the edges of your floor before using this thing—it doesn’t do anything for the last inch or two. Luckily those areas don’t get as messy so a quick sweep is good enough for every day and then I deep clean occasionally with a rag.It also does leave very slight dirty streaks which are visible if your floor has no texture like mine. I would imagine ANY amount of texture in nice wood or tile would completely hide these, they’re very faint. Doesn’t bug me at all but it might bug some people and I saw that mentioned in negative reviews before purchasing, so thought I’d mention it.This is also not a magic wand and you shouldn’t expect it to deep clean stuck on food. Sorry!! I don’t think something like that actually exists. What I do is clean the stickiest areas under the table first and then circle back to them at the end. After two passes I just scrub what’s left by hand (or let’s be honest about half the time I just leave it for later.)Before buying this the floors were by far my most hated chore. We were paying someone to come clean a couple times per week and I would still freak out about messes tracked in or food dropped from the table, because it would be several days before the next cleaning. Trying to take care of wet food spills was the BANE OF MY EXISTENCE. Now I clean every couple days or as needed and it’s NBD. It takes less time and doesn’t work up a sweat like sweeping and mopping.My #1 tip: After cleaning, don’t empty the clean water tank! Leave the little bit that’s left in there for quick cleanup of small messes. I also swap out the wet roller for the dry one when I put it away, leaving it ready to go for the next time my kid drops his entire smoothie on the floor. :)",7
cna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,the United States,27-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Update: 2 year's and still going strong still love it.I pretty much run a rescue out of my house. 😆.  I'm a vet Tech and have a habit of rescuing animals so as looking for an easy way to keep my floors clean.  This thing vacuums up all of the hair and cleans my floors amazing. Some of the reviews say that it's hard to clean but let me tell you it's not it's way simpler than washing out he mopping bucket.  I don't know what I did before this.  My floors are sparkling clean I have more time to spend with my furry friends. I think everyone should have this in their life. Feel free to ask any questions I'm here to help I want everybody to have a fur free pet friendly life. 😉,13
DebbieD,3.0 out of 5 stars,It won't eliminate your vacuum cleaner,the United States,20-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"After using this cleaner for about 3 weeks I'm a little on the fence. Its a novelty, it vacs and mops at the same time. But, we have a wood stove and lots of ashes and wood chips along with the regular pet and kitchen debris. I don't think this could handle all that (though to be fair I have not tried) so I use my regular vacuum cleaner first on the areas with the greatest amount of dirt. Then I use the Crosswave. It still picks up more dirt and hair that I have missed and the water is really dirty so it does a pretty good job of cleaning the floors (which are Quarry Tile and wood). However, I previously vacuumed and then used a Swiffer wet jet. I think I prefer the Swiffer. Its smaller and more agile for getting into tight places. Today I vacuumed, then used the Bissell. The floor still looked dirty here and there so I used the Swiffer and the pad was pretty dirty meaning the Bissell missed quite a bit of dirt on my tile floors. My bathrooms have porcelain tile which is smooth and the Bissell seems to slide around and not work too well on those floors. The Bissell is probably great if you have floors with little debris and not much dirt but I don't think its worth the price. I don't hate it and I am using it but I will not buy another one when this one malfunctions. Its not a time saver for me - I still have to vacuum most of the time.",15
Rebekah,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s okay, but…",the United States,7-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I did a lot of looking before I chose this particular model, and I had high hopes. So, here’s an honest, unpaid, un-asked for review by me.Pros1) No messy pads to change.  My back yard is mostly all bare ground, so we get a lot of mud and dirt dragged in the house by children and dogs alike. It’s nice to not have to change disposable pads 4+ times when mopping my floors2) More efficient scrubbing.  I have severe back problems, so I can’t get down on my knees and scrub away things that get super stuck/ground into the floor. I’ve had some gum and a couple stickers stuck to my hardwood for a while now, and the brush took them off almost in a snap (with a few slow passes over them)Cons1) Still need to use my swiffer  This machine leaves about a one inch gap between the wall and the brush, so I still have to make a pass around the edges of the room.2) Disappointing vacuum  Other reviews have RAVED over the abilities of the vacuum, but I have a German Shepherd and a German Pinscher; the hair just gets tangled up in the brush. Instead of eliminating the extra step of vacuuming before mopping, I still have to use my full sized vacuum.3) Beware excess dirt  First time I used this, I did not use my full sized vacuum first (as my test run). After a certain point, the brush absorbed too much dirt (or something), and it just started flinging mid back out again. I had to completely remove the brush and clean it in the sink.Overall, it didn’t reduce the work of cleaning all my floors as much as I’d hoped, but I do still use it.",5
Eva Sibrava,4.0 out of 5 stars,A professionals Opinion on Pet Pro vs. the regular bissell crosswave  vs hoover,the United States,22-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"First I tried using the regular bissell crosswave after using it at a clients home. I decided the scrub machine was worth paying about $100.00 more than the hoover, which I and my clients have gotten so frustrated with the hoover since their machines seem to go bad quite quickly for many years.  I was reluctant to buy the bissell with so many bad experiences with the hoover. But I liked the idea of not mopping peoples homes with dirty water or mine for that matter. The concept of the machine was a great idea, if only a company could make a machine worth buying. And I gotta say Bissell has pulled it off. Both Bissell machines work very well, but if you have pets it is highly recommended that you spend the extra money to buy the pet pro crosswave. I have put it to the test in one of clients homes who have 2 long haired cats and a long haired big dog. It does handle the hair much better around the rolling scrub brush. Though I do recommend as well to vacuum with another vacuum first before washing the floors with the scrub machines. The pet pro roller is made much better than the regular machine.  Pets do have oil in their skin and their drool sticks to the floor almost like glue so a better rolling brush is needed. I did notice that my regular bissell does pivot around while cleaning is a bit better, but not a significant enough to make a big difference. Though it would be nice if they adjusted that pet pro to do it as well as the regular one, if we are going to pay almost $40.00 more for it. Also pet pro has another part in the dirty water container to catch the hair and larger pieces of stuff that comes through while cleaning that you can just pull out before dumping into your wash sink. If you find it to be more of a hassle you can just leave it out it doesn't effect the performance of the machine. The one thing both machines don't have that I think they should is an extra roller with more bristles in it then what they have because I think it would clean tile floors that are a bit rougher with more indentions much better as to why I only gave pet pro 4 stars. But I still believe it's by far better than mopping. Sweeping and vacuuming doesn't get the tiny grains of sand and if we miss it while vacuuming the scrub machines get the rest of it.  If your floors are very dirty I would suggest mopping them very well first then use your bissell and if you like really clean floors and want them Shine beautifully go behind with the Sharp Genis floor steamer. The steamer will also take care of the steaks if you get them while scrubbing or you could just go behind with a flat mop or regular dry mop before the area completely drys. Pet pro machine really needs to have the bissell cleaning solution suggested for pets it works much better.  I have owned the regular bissell for a year and it still works as good as it did the first time I used it, so I feel the machines could last for many years just as long as we properly take care of them. Also another thing I liked about the pet pro over the regular bissell is that it is much easier to remove the cover that protects the roller so we can clean the machine after each use. I actually broke one of the plastic pieces on the regular bissell because it was so hard to pull off. Not only will you notice how much cleaner your floors are, but you will feel it on your feet. There is nothing like have super clean floors!!!! I don't have pets of my own and if I didn't have homes I cleaned without pets I would spend the extra and buy the Pet Pro crosswave!!!! Love the beautiful Purple color too!!! Thanks Bissell for designing a wonderful floor machines!!",6
Book Hound,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed and feet are clean.,the United States,24-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had been contemplating this product for a while. A friend bought one and she shared her experience and disbelief with me so I finally decided to buy it.  I really thought my vacuuming and mopping skills were ok but it looks like I was mistaken.  I vacuum and mop minimum of once a week and that nasty water there is what I got each time after 3 nice and slow passes over my slate floor.  I even vacuumed and mopped before I used my new Bissell.  If you look close enough you can actually see the tiles are brighter, trust me, they are.  I could also feel a difference on my feet when I was done and the after smell was pretty neutral.  It picked up dirt that my regular vacuum didn’t.  I can’t say I was shocked but I was impressed.  The vacuum is a little loud but that brush roller is spinning pretty fast so I can understand why it’s loud.  It was east to put together and easy to clean up after I was done.  I did what others recommended about leaving the pieces to dry before putting it away so it doesn’t get musty.  The only thing this needs is telescoping tentacles to get along the wall, it doesn’t quite make it.  Where have you been all my life you dirty dirt cleaner?!",5

Tom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Nice Floor Cleaner,the United States,1-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We are the average family we have a Kitchen / Dining Room and 2 bathrooms and a living room all with hard floors.  To say the floors were dirty was understatement..  We cleaned 2 bathrooms then clean the Kitchen and Dining room  and could not be happier.  IT removed stuck on crud and other dried who know what, as long as you give a good spray and then run over it a few (5 - 10) times..The other nice thing was how dry the floors were when we completed out cleaning, we could walk on them in less than 10 minutes..The only complaint and reason I only gave it a 4 stars was because it did not clean the grout lines very well.  The cleaner did a nice job on floors that were completely flat but I did not feel that the scrubber did not get into the grout lines.  I might have missed some adjustment but it would have been nice if I could buy a deep scrubber roller or some other way to get into the crevices.",8

Heather Ackerman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update, don't do it.",the United States,20-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So apparently my previous vacuum wasn't doing very much at all.In full disclosure, I used this on my carpets. And it handled it so well.Let's start with the bad, just to get it out of the way. I had a hair wrap in the first fifteen minutes, even though I'd used a hair remover on the floors before (which worked amazingly, a purchase I'd made at the same time of this). It was simple enough to remove, but the brush is kind of hard to put back on.The brush, though, is why I bought this. Honestly. Because I am the QUEEN of hair wraps, and a removable brush roll is EXACTLY what I need. I don't care if I have to clean a hair wrap every time I clean, the fact that I can clean it off fairly easily is a lifesaver.Also, the hard wood suction could be a LITTLE better, but hey, that's just being nitpicky.Other than that, I was just absolutely blown away by this little machine. I never realized how much cat hair my cat left around.Even just using it as a vacuum, I am impressed by this. But then you add in the wet cleaner, and that's just a bonus. Is it a full on steam cleaner or rug cleaner? No. It is not. But it does just add in a little bit more cleanlinessI absolutely adore the little stand that came with it, and a place to clean your brush roll.... You guys are just speaking my language!UPDATEIt's been about five months since I bought this thing, and I'm already in the market for another vacuum. The place where you can remove the brush roll has become absolutely caked with dust and it has literally BURNT onto the motor. I can't vacuum at ALL before it starts to smell. That fancy ""no wrap"" brush head? Too good to be true, I guess. I'm so mad that I even bought this.",13
k619,3.0 out of 5 stars,Streaks,the United States,18-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I was super excited to get this as we have 3 dogs and dark wood laminate floors. The vacuum works pretty well but the mopping leaves a bit to be desired. The streaks are terrible with this thing and you have to go over a lot of things several times. Also I noticed you have to clean the dirty water container and brush a lot throughout your cleaning. I will say it’s somewhat better than a broom and mop but if you have dark shiny floors be ready for streaks and going back over the floors with a towel to get them out.,14
DiazGuam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Machine!,the United States,15-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I just got it today and started using it immediately.  It was amazing and replaced 2 buckets (solution + rinse water), a mop and a vacuum and I used to vacuum first then mop and change water twice.  This machine did all that and was so light to move around and very flexible to go into and under everything.  The big bonus was cleaning it - it actually cleans itself and everything else is a rinse off.  The bigger bonus was the amount of pet hair it found - the size of a baseball!!! I don't think my floors were ever cleaned this well before.",16
William Denton,4.0 out of 5 stars,Unit should be cleaned and dried when finished using.,the United States,16-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought my Bissell after searching many reviews.  I have wood laminated floors throughout my house with two cats and three dogs, I usually clean once a week or every other week depending on the weather.  I like that I do not need to sweep before using this product but I do run it without spraying cleaning fluid first. Do not over spray as this can cause dirty smears. The cons are that the unit needs to be cleaned after each use.  My son did not clean it after using it in his room and the dirty water in the reservoir stunk when I went to use it next.  It comes apart with little effort but the hair and dirt left behind in the dirty water tank area is nasty but fairly easy to dispose of.  I  recommend watching some videos on how to clean it.  Do run the clean brush cycle first and leave the brush out to dry or switch out dry spare brush before reinstalling and always put away when it's clean and dry so it's ready to use.  When I ran out of the sample cleaners that Bissell makes, I looked up mixture to make my own.  I really like  2 TBSP Baking Soda and 2  TBSP  Liquid Castile Soap  mixed with 3 cups of water.  I add a little more water to fill line as needed.  I recommend Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap 18-1 Hemp Peppermint.  Leaves a light minty fresh smell.  If you have a big house, then use this ratio or cut in half for small jobs.",5
Kat,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm thoroughly disgusted,the United States,13-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have a small 1200 SQ ft house with no carpeting, some of the flooring dating back to 1956 (yes, it's a fixer upper). We have vinyl flooring and laminate, one light color area rug, two teenagers, two adults, two dogs and three cats. I hate mopping.  I hate wet swifters because they streak and leave my floors dull and sticky. My laminate has been a war for 12 years as well.  Windex left a build up, steamers aren't recommended and streak, and I basically had given up.I bought this because it was a great deal and because my new area rug was already showing the path of travel.  I have a regular carpet cleaner but knew it would be too much for this 5x7 rug, and my decades old Green Machine is too small. I also liked that I could use it on my floors. I have a robovac that runs every morning, so the dust bunnies are kept at bay.I assembled this and went to work. I ordered the area rug brush too but didn't use it for the trial run.  After about a five minute learning curve I was off. My floors were overdue for a good cleaning so this got the ultimate test. There were a few spills and stains that the kids hadn't cleaned properly and one of my cats had hacked up a hairball overnight.  I filled it for the large cleaning and got to work.  Took me maybe half an hour to do the busy spots of the house, living room, kitchen, hallway, and the entrance to my bedroom/master bath, as well as the areas on the rug that needed a boost.  I didn't do a thorough job in the living room but it still looks better than it did. Very little streaking, and I'm going to chalk that up to build up from years prior. My kitchen vinyl, about 10 years old, also looks good. The hallway shines. And the 60+ linoleum in my bedroom is markedly cleaner than I've ever gotten it. I cleaned until I was out of solution.Ran the clean for the machine, super easy. Removing the brush was a cinch and as promised, no hair wrapped on it, from my long hair to pet hair.  The best part was my son and I couldn't find the strainer attachment as we were marveling at how dirty the water in the tank was. It was like the color of old asphalt (remember, I didn't do the two bathrooms, just the high traffic areas).  We searched and searched and I said ""I'll have to contact Bissell""...and then we saw the stem handle. Keep in mind, my robovac had run just two hours earlier. When I removed it and we saw how much debris was sitting in it, we were stunned. Cat and dog hair plus other items Then I dumped the water into the kitchen sink. There were tiny bits of cat sand and cardboard from the cat scratcher.  What the strainer didn't catch, the drain screen did, so I wasn't at all worried about the filthy water going down the drain.The Febreze scent wasn't overpowering, and the cleaning solution was very effective. The multi-purpose brush did a decent job on my area rug, and the machine didn't over saturate it.  I'll go back with the rug brush and do a more thorough cleaning later.Did it take longer than a mop and bucket? I'm leaning to yes on that. But I did take my time too. Cleaning the machine wasn't an issue and not a huge deal.  Am I glad I made the investment? Yes, no regrets at this point. Floors dried quickly and were cleaned very well.  Going barefoot I can feel a difference.  I wouldn't dream of using it as a vaccum alone. The noise level was more than I expected but then again, it is a two chamber wet cleaner so it wasn't expected to be silent. My son is distance learning due to the pandemic and he didn't complain about it. No regrets other than that my floors were far dirtier than I expected.  But using clean solution was the difference I think. With a mop you're spreading dirt.  This is awesome. I'd think if you just wanted to run it with warm water and give your floors a good rinse you could do that easily.",4
vaultdwellr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for households with huge, hairy, drooly dogs",the United States,26-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have two 130+ lb dogs and a baby on the way, so I've been looking for something to make the task of cleaning the 1000+ square feet of laminate and tile in my home easier. Needless to say, traditional mopping with those two is a backbreaking chore, and I don't want my kid crawling around on muddy paw prints or dried drool. So, I added this machine to my baby registry and just got it yesterday.I was worried the suction might not be able to handle the tumbleweeds of fur my Newfoundland leaves lying around, but the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro easily met that challenge. I didn't have to do any pre-vacuuming or sweeping. While it took several passes on area rug mode around the dogs' water dish--where they tend to leave LOADS of watery drool that quickly dries into a mess that typically takes a lot of hand scrubbing to clean--this machine left the floor shiny, clean, and streak-free once it was fully dry.The included solution smells nice, too. It's pretty strong when wet, but dissipates into a pleasant background fragrance when dry.I heartily recommend the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro to anyone with large breed dogs. This thing is going to save me so much time and scrubbing!",8
MPBF2011,5.0 out of 5 stars,So glad they did,the United States,4-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Had the previous model and always wished they made one for pets with the pet hair issue. So glad they did. Purchased the new pet one and love it.,22
Lindsey Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!!,the United States,6-Jul-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Holy crap! This thing is amazing! Granted, I have only used it today right after it was delivered, but I'm so stoked on it! This dirty tank is from my grandma's kitchen. Grandma is very particular about how clean her kitchen is, so I was shocked to see this. I'll update if I have any issues, but so far, amazing!",22
J. Logan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mopping is sort of fun,the United States,13-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Mostly Changed my view on mopping,  it’s really more like using a vacuum cleaner than using a mop or other floor washing machine.  It’s really important that use this just like you would a vacuum cleaner, the same speed and motions, it leaves the floor clean and mostly dry, or go over the section a second time to vacoom up remaining water. After a few minutes the floor is completely dry. I don’t have to block off the area I’m mopping to keep the dog off because it’s basically dry.  I keep it sitting in my laundry room filled with solution so it’s ready to go  for any spills that happen,  i’ve even used it in front of guests if they spill something on the floor.  Super convenient if you have a dog,  and the thing picks up an amazing amount of dirt",9
Sara,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your time.,the United States,12-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Small note: I bought the Pet version but the only difference is a flimsy filter in the tank that is useless anyway.When I first bought this, I was in love. We have a couple of elder dogs who urinate on the floor in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep. I didn’t mind once I bought this because it was so easy to just clean it up. We had a pee brush and a general “cleaning” brush as to not cross-contaminate and clean the floor with a pee brush.Cleaning this thing after use isn’t the most fun I’ve had. It’s a bit of a hassle, and if you don’t clean it immediately the smell is awful depending on what it was last used for.My biggest gripe is that this thing leaves a streaky mess if the wheels get gross. I would have to stop every so often and wipe down the wheels or else they’d leave a streak where I just cleaned. Also, it’s absolute garbage at cleaning the areas closest to the baseboard/wall. I’d have a clean floor and then have to go back with a swiffer to get the small line of dirt against the wall because the way this thing is designed leaves about an inch in front that just can’t get clean.A couple of months ago the cap to the bottle combusted out of nowhere. I went to use it and water was gurgling out of places it shouldn’t. I paid to replace the bottle and it worked fine. Now, out of absolutely nowhere I went to turn it on and it’s dead. Nothing is blocking the wheels, the tank, the tube that everything shoots up into, etc. Cord is fine. It just died.I’ve been using this since April of 2018. It’s now July 2019 and it’s already crapped the bed and doesn’t turn on. I’m not even sure if it’s worth taking to the repair shop. By the way, don’t contact customer service when yours dies. They’ll just give you a link to the trouble shooting page and then tell you to find the nearest repair shop. It’s more of a headache than anything. Yeah, there’s a warranty and everything should be covered unless they make up a reason that says it’s user error and won’t be covered which I’m half expecting at this point. I’m probably going to just let it die and find a steam mop from a different brand and go back to using my cordless Dyson and mopping. It’s a lot less hassle then dealing with this hot garbage.",7
elise,3.0 out of 5 stars,Read ALL the reviews before purchasing,the United States,16-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Today was the first time I used this, I did not use my full-sized vacuum first. After about 30 minutes I noticed the brush absorbed too much dirt and it just started flinging mud out on the floor. I had to completely remove the brush and clean it in the sink, then re-mop what I had just done.Still need to use my Swiffer due to about a one-inch gap between the wall and the brush, so I still have to make a pass around the edges of the room. Disappointing vacuum based on other reviews that have RAVED over the abilities of the vacuum, but a small amount of doggie hair just gets tangled up in the brush or stuck to the floor. Instead of eliminating the extra step of vacuuming before mopping, I still have to use my full-sized vacuum.Overall, it didn’t reduce the work of cleaning my floors as I’d hoped. It's not terrible, and the vacuuming is really nice, but I'm just not wowed by the mopping. I continued to use the machine on a 2nd area of the floor, then a 3rd area. After a few minutes into each area, the mop wheels began leaving streaks and again the floors really didn't get very clean, the mop brush began leaving mud spots and wet hair on the floor. I had to hand clean the mop brush every few minutes.  I was surprised because the way the rotating brush is designed would ensure a good job, but I've really not been impressed. It leaves wavey water lines and doesn't handle transitioning from hard floor to thin entry rugs well. If you're doing a small area rug directly from the hard floor you'll have lines of dirty water all around the rug, unless you pick the machine up and put it on the rug. I think it does a better job on tile. I'm honestly torn on whether or not I should keep it. I could get a better carpet/rug cleaner or go back to the broom + steam mop or broom + microfiber mop that I've been using. But I have back issues and was hoping this machine would be a help to me in keeping my floors clean, but as of today, it is more of a hassle than a help. It is always such a hassle to rebox, take it to the nearest UPS pickup (15 minutes away from home), and hope that it is returned and a refund issued. I live alone with a small dog so there's not much dirt to clean, so when this machine left more dirt on the floor than before I started ... very disappointing to me. I definitely have buyer remorse.  Definitely not worth the $269. Update: I tried to give this machine another chance after going through the cleaning procedure. NOPE!!To clean the machine is more of a hassle than what it is worth. I understand that a little water may splash during normal cleaning of any machine but the tray should catch it. Unfortunately there was so much water under the tray that I had to bed over and clean it up. With sever back problems this is not acceptable. There should be no water at all to clean up. After reading my critical review from yesterday I decided to give it another try - trying to justify spending $269 on this machine. NOPE!! Again it left wet wheel streaks - repeatedly & nonstop, the roller cleans lopsided (even after ensuring it was properly placed), still leaves a dirty 1"" space. Although there is a rug and hard floor setting there seems to be no difference in the way it cleans between the settings.  Not sure about this one. I just know that when trying to clean my entry rug (following the directions) the machine stuck to it and stopped working until I pulled it off of the rug. One good note, it does clean well. If you don't mind cleaning more messes up after using this machine than it's for you. I can't justify the expense versus the aggrevation.",3
DSUlk,1.0 out of 5 stars,The motor burned out in 2 months! DO NOT BUY!,the United States,28-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have been a faithful Hoover user for most of my life. I have owned and loved several Hoover Floormate hardwood cleaners over the years, but each have stopped working after 1 to 2 years. I saw the high star rating of the Bissell Crosswave so I decided to give it a shot. I was not happy to spend double the amount of the Floormate but thought at that price, it would surely last many years. The Bissell Crosswave has a smaller cleaning head which means it takes longer to clean a full room. I was also surprised how small the dirty water reservoir was which means at least twice the number of times you have to stop, turn off the machine, and dump out the dirty water. In addition, the Crosswave has small plastic pieces that need to be cleaned ever time it’s used. From the day I received the Bissell, I kept thinking that I should have purchased the Hoover. Thinking about the time it would take to pack up the Crosswave and to get it to store to have it shipped back, I decided to keep it. HUGE MISTAKE! The LED lights on the cleaning head went out after just 6 weeks and just yesterday when I was cleaning the floor, I smelled something burning. Before I had a chance to even turn off the machine, the motor made a loud grinding sound and then died! Since the 30 day return window has passed, I doubt that I can get a refund. It is still under warranty (plus I purchased the 3 year extended warranty) so I will probably be spending the next 3 years sending multiple Bissell  Crosswave machines back and forth to be repaired! Regardless, I just ordered a Hoover cleaner.",8
Amanda Lindsay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Answer to ""How Do I Keep These Stupid Floors Clean?!?!?""",the United States,6-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have two geriatric cats.  I think you can draw your own conclusions about what that means for my floors.  This thing not only vacuums up the litter that gets kicked around, and the all the fur (seriously how are my cats not bald by now?), dust, and ""what in the world is that"" stuff that inevitably gets tracked into the house, but it also DEEP CLEANS the floors too.  I was skeptical, but it deep cleans the floors better than me scrubbing them on my hands and knees.PLUS - it gets rid of the lingering odors from said geriatric cat accidents (I'm talking potty and puke you guys).  It comes with 2 brushes so you can swap them out as needed and some little bottles of their cleaning solution, and a 50% off coupon for more cleaning solution (which I normally don't see the point of but their's is pretty good).My only complaints: since the handle doesn't go flat, you can only get so far under low furniture (if that's a deal breaker for you - but to me it's something I'm willing to deal with considering how good this thing is). Also, you have to recline the handle in order to get it to do the self cleaning, which means you need to prop it up against something or hold it while it spins in the tray.  Again, not a deal breaker.The cord is long enough that I didn't have to keep unplugging it, another tic in the ""Pro"" column, and it's easy to operate (I figure that's important to say - maybe?).  If you don't like this thing, then you might have some gross floors that need something more industrial... I'm just sayin'...",2
FknTori,5.0 out of 5 stars,A machine worth the money,the United States,24-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So I bought this product to clean up after dogs. I have an old female who doesnt wanna go outside, so when I'm off with my boyfriend and my dad is in charge, she pees on the floor. Almost always. And if you ever tried cleaning up dog pee with anything but a towel.. it smears. We'll just say my dad isnt the BEST at cleaning. So I often come home to dirty floors.This thing scrubbed my floors beautifully! There was NOTHING getting stuck to my feet!I will say, that if you want a machine like this to last... you need to spot clean first. Do NOT just treat this like an every day vacuum and you've been neglecting the floors. I saw a bad review about kitty litter clogging it. Does that not sound, idk.. obvious to you?! The clean up was easy, even tho kinda gross! It comes with an insert that separates the hair and large dirt from the water, but that doesn't mean nothing is stuck on the walls of the container. I would suggest a sink strainer (which every adult should have) while you clean the tank. And you should ALWAYS empty the tank. Don't get lazy and think it's the product's fault if it smells funky.For dirtier areas (aka dry pee infested spots) you can put it on area rug mode to get a closer clean. Depending on how often you swiffer or mop, you can always just use the rug mode for that for-sure clean.I gave 4 stars on suction and deep cleaning bc I don't think those are terribly important if you do your spot cleaning first, but it sure did a good job.",4
S. THAYERYATES,3.0 out of 5 stars,Three stars for Bissell - one star for the product,the United States,2-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The second Crosswave I've owned in the past year has died.  I don't blame it.  He has had to deal with two great danes and an owner who has a tendancy to ride it hard and put it up dirty.  However, if you're going to pay $300+ for an appliance you use once a week, you want it to last more than a year.  At least I do.To Bissel's defence, they fully replaced the first one.  It died after only 3 months.  This second one has lasted a full eigh months, but only because I bought a steam mop that I like better, and rarely use the Crosswave.  So, yeah.  if you ask me, it's a piece of garbage - like, literally, I've put it out by the trash cans because it's trash day.  If my warrantee wasn't up, it's possible I would call Bissel again to ask them to replace it.  At this point, there's no chance I would ever go to the effort of putting another one together, much less mopping with it.",8
Hillary,3.0 out of 5 stars,Are these reviews paid?,the United States,10-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If you're wondering if you should get a Bissell  Crosswave and if they're worth it. My honest opinion is no. They are not worth the price. It does clean the floor. But it doesn't do a magnificent job in sticky spots. This is a Crosswave pet pro and I have to pretreat any sticky spots with vinegar in a spray bottle or I have to make 7 to 12 passes to get it to come up.  It doesn't do a good job at all if the floor is not vacuumed prior to using it. The pet hair just clogs the machine and it won't work right. I highly highly doubt it does much to clean area rugs other then get them wet. There is about a 2 inch gap to either side where the machine doesn't clean the cracks. So you have to go back and do that by hand. I got this because my Yorkie is 11 years old and she will frequently pee in the house.  It does work to clean up her little puddles and remove the stink from the hard floor.Overall, I wouldn't buy it again. I have had just as good of results with other products like Floormate or steam mops.",2
RomDeussen,5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't want to spend the money-so glad I did,the United States,27-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have ceramic floors, and 3 dogs, a toddler, and a ranch.  I have broken SO many floor cleaners.  I need something with spinning brushes b/c with the dust, the pad ones just smear mud.  Nothing holds up.So, I got the extended warranty and tried this one.  I have not been disappointed except on carpets.Con's:This will spray on a carpet and lightly clean but for me, it promptly gets full of fibers and doesn't suck up a lot of the water. You will still need a carpet cleaner if you want anything but cleaning up small spots, like a muddy footprint or spilled drink.Does not do well on anything over 1/4"" pile.Pro's:Super easy to clean the brushes.  It comes with two as well so it's easy to stop, clean one, and swap out for the other roller.It's also very easy to clean the dirty water tank.Has a great little storage upright rack that keeps it all togetherThe head swivels and can get into some remarkable placesIt does a phenomenal job on tile, ceramic, and other hard floorsDoes a good just overall daily dust removal off the very short pile area rugsIf you have hard floors, this is worth the high price tag.  Clean up is a breeze, it's light, it will just freshen up area rugs with short pile and mats (I would definitely vacuum first though), and it really just zips along.",2
Stacy Inman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Time saver and great product!,the United States,15-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've had this product for a couple weeks now but I wanted to use it a few times before a wrote a review.  Over all, I think this is a wonderful product and well worth the money. However, I have realized if you have A LOT of dog hair you may want to sweep or vacuum beforehand, because let's face it, we all know what wet hair does, matte into clumps. Also, it doesn't get edges very well but if you face the Crosswave towards the edge, it does a lot better.On some positive notes, the hair and large debris catcher inside the dirty water tank is AMAZING! It will definitely save my pipes from being clogged with hair. Yay! It is also so easy to disassemble and clean. The clean water/solution goes a long way and the floors dry so quickly.As for area rugs, if the rug is somewhat large, it does amazing! Smaller rugs, not so much. In my opinion, those type of rugs are better just thrown in the washing machine. As for my 3'x5' rug just inside my back door, it has never been washed and has been there for about 18 months. I was amazed, and embarrassed, by how nasty the water was that came out of that rug. I've cleaned it 4 times now and the rug looks almost brand newSo overall, I absolutely love my Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro and highly recommend it to anyone with a large area to ""mop.""",4
Mindy,5.0 out of 5 stars,it's not loud but water does end up with the dry dirt and become a mess.,the United States,8-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Update: It's great for light cleaning on hard floors if your toddler drops a gummies it's not going to clean them up that's for sure lol Um Also it did clean a egg off the floor that we dropped to test it out and is very easy to clean out and up after each use! I did use it to get the cat room cleaned up and did good. But if you have messy kids that drop stuff on kitchen floor and leave it till mom is around to clean it. you will still need to scrub it first before this vacuum is able to finish the job, It doesn't do a good job on the scrubbing part! I'll finish paying it off but my husband isn't to thrilled about it He still says I should have went with a shark wet/dry vac. But its grown on me due to the felt I love the smell of the febreze freshener :) and got cat hair up good too.I was happy with the looks and how low sound it puts out, Did clean up dirt very well, But when I did my hard floor if your looking for something to replace a mop, This product is not it. Mom of 7 here and I still have to use a mop on my hard floor even after using this. I am crushed i was excited to be able to save time on cleaning. To good to be true should have known! ugh and The look on my husband's face due to performance of this product with the price tag! I felt like I failed our family!

Allison,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really wanted to love this but...,the United States,21-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Yes this product works, it got some dirty water off the floor at the end. Very easy to use. But no matter what I tried I ended up with streaks all over the floor. I tried troubleshooting both through Bissell site and general reviews. I moved slowly, didn't press the trigger on the second sweep, made sure not to saturate the brush too much, ect. I break my back twice a week so I really wanted something less time consuming and easier. But just doesn't compare to a good broom, mop and shine for a fraction of the price.",3
msvette2u,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works great!,the United States,2-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I read a lot of the reviews here before I purchased this.First off, it is what it is, and it isn't what it isn't.It works best on a floor that has been swept or vacuumed. If there's a ton of dog hair (we have 7 dogs, including a German Shepherd) it's best to vacuum that up prior to starting. The first time I used this, I realized that, because it clogged up.But then I went over it the next day after I'd vacuumed up the clumps of hair from the Shepherd, and it worked like a charm.I've since learned it's mainly a floor scrubber - we have hard floors (vinyl) and this machine works so great on them!My floor hasn't been this clean since it was installed - we use primarily a swiffer (the wet wipes) and they simply cannot clean like this does!As for ""wet dog smell"" I read in another review, I've not experienced that - because I clean the machine every time I use it, and do not put it away dirty!I disassemble it including the holding tank, which I wash and rinse, and take the soap dispenser out, as well.I do like the smell of the soap that came with it, and will likely buy more, but I could see using some other type of floor disinfectant as well (7 dogs!)Anyway, you cannot go wrong with this machine as long as you realize it's limitations - it's not a regular vacuum, and while it can get light/small particles as naturally left over when vacuuming or sweeping, relying on it to pick up a lot of stuff isn't fair to the machine and it's performance.",2
Paul D Crawford Jr,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mop is not worth the money you spend on it.,the United States,29-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum mop is not worth the money I spent on purchasing it.The map has OK suction and picks up loose bowel movements from my dog pretty well. The cleaning with the brush roller is not very good at all, does not pick up anything that has been ground and my laminate floors. I have to use my steamer along with the mop to get up certain things. By ground in my main step on, and this is on a flat surface not rough, so I have to use a separate machine to help. This mop also leaks a lot. As well as leaking a lot the mop puts out more than the usual amount of water mixed with solution of course.Yesterday the mop sound like it was about to blow and then after a Little bit calmed down. I called the company and they told me to send it to them and they would investigate the cause of the malfunctions, however it would take two weeks to investigate The malfunction and of course with slower than usual slow shipping from the c 19 virus it would probably take another week to get to my location. I did not send the vacuum to them due to the fact my warranty had been void. This is of course my own fault, however I could blame it on the dogs since they were the ones that chewed the cord in half. After splicing a cord on any machine under warranty it will void the warranty no matter if it is a Bissell or other brand. I am a electrician and have made many splices in my lifetime and I know what I am doing, this was not the fault of the splice. The machines malfunction was due to the I manufacture F up. And of course the manufacture should make a slightly better product and preferably one that will pick up ground in crap. Bing on a smooth laminate floor it should not have trouble picking up something that has been stepped on. That something having five dogs can be quite smelly. Also they filter does not filter out smells as well as you would expect, however I do think that the filter is only there to catch dirt and debris from going into the motor.( I do think that if you are selling a product based on pets you should have some sort of air purification filter. This this is only my personal suggestion.)",2
Kelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell Crosswave is perfect!,the United States,10-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have had the Crosswave for 6 months now. And love it!  We have all tile flooring and a few rugs in our home.  The Crosswave is so simple and easy to use. It vacuums and mops!  No more lugging around the vacuum or broom then mopping!  I have noticed that if something is stepped on, on the tile like food and hardened it does take the mop a few minutes to soften it and then get it or not at all. But I am okay with that, I don’t Expect it to be perfect in every way. Our grout still looks new. No darker spots in high traffic areas.  Rugs-great vacuum on the rugs and I did switch my brush to the rug brush to vacuum and clean it with solution - did a great job!  The rugs were not soaking wet nor did the tile under get wet or damp.  Maybe if the rugs are thin, I could see damp underneath.  Cleaning the mop is an important when you are finished. Putting the mop back on the tray and doing the rinse twice I would suggest. Then taking all parts (brush, dirty water container) and letting them dry out is also a must.How I know it works great - we had two togethers. One person dropped bbq sauce on the floor and I got out the Crosswave and it sucked up every bit of the sauce even in the grout. The next one someone spilled red wine on the floor and it did the same. No stains in the grout and sucked up all the wine!It used to take me 12 swifter pads or 6 steam mop pads to fully clean our homes floors and it took 2/3 days (then right back on the floors again) but now it takes me an hour to an hour and a half.

That being said, it has some disadvantages or flaws that may make you decide not to buy it.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this little thing! I have used it once or twice a day since it came in, and cannot imagine life without it. Before I was using a 1970s Kirby, and mopping with a microfiber spray mop. It got the job done, but not as deeply as it should have. Then I tried a stick vacuum, and it worked great until it died out about a year later (I sucked up my husband's hair after giving him a haircut...lesson learned, hair=fire in cheap vacuums.)I had this vacuum on my wishlist for a while, but was worried that, for the price, I wouldn't get what I wanted. But hey, Amazon has this amazing return policy, so I ordered it after some research as to what model.First, the pros:-easy to clean-refreshes rugs well (we do not have carpet in our house.)-scrubs hard floors-vacuums up ALL manner of debris (from wheat thins to dog food.)-does not throw dust as you go-hair wrap is pretty much impossible (even with my butt length hair, and curly pet's hair.)These are amazing things for a vacuum, and at this price point are above standard. You can walk on hardwood or tile and still have clean feet. I even used it on our brick by the wood stove, and it cleaned it SO well (goodbye scrub brush!)Cons:- no attachments-turns off roller when in 90° angle-hard floor button doesn't put out enough solution for very dirty floors-filter gets mildew smelling (big design flaw.)-cord does not retract-wheels can roll dirt onto the just cleaned floor, and sometimes dirty water pools accumulate behind the machine.My biggest issue is that, from time to time, I find dirty wheel lines on the floor, or have a pool of dirty water accumulate under the machine as I go. I think this is more user error, as I am holding the button to wash it the majority of the time (and possibly flooding the floor.) The filter is also impossible to clean as it gets wet while mopping, so ti always smells. These I can deal with, if only the machine had attachments. I hate feeling like I need to buy another machine to surface wash my furniture, or vacuum my stairs. I can't see spending another $200 plus on another machine that does those things, so I really wish it did those. Also, if you have plush rugs o r shag carpet, don't bother buying this. It is extremely hard to move on carpets like that; even my husband has trouble.In the end, this machine cleans the floors all at once, and saves me a lot of time. A spray mop still needs to have the pad removed, a mop and bucket need to be dumped and washed after use, and a vacuum still needs to be emptied. This vacuum may take a minute to clean, but it does the job a vacuum, mop and bucket does without the extra hassel.And for those who dump theirs in the sink...EW. Dump it in the toilet people! Then rinse in your bathroom or utility sink, and done.So clean, so easy.",One
Pamela,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy, fast, no more paying someone to come wash my floors.",the United States,25-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I used this on a large hardwood kitchen floor on a linoleum bathroom floor and all of terazza  entrance way which is quite large So happy and impressed with this product I will be able to cut out my house cleaner once a month and do these floors myself. A little more work than regular vacuuming but I love this product,14
S. J. Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,18-Apr-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love my new floor cleaner! It was packages very well with eco friendly materials and very easy to assemble (you just have to inset the handle into the body). I love the strainer for pet hair, the mat for cleaning it after use, and the fact that it doesn’t use a ton of water!",17
Traci Hart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bye, bye Siberian Husky hair!!",the United States,5-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've only had this machine for about a week but I am super impressed!  We have two Siberian huskies....one standard coat and one wooly coat.....and as the saying goes 'Huskies only shed once a year.  For 365 days!""!  We also have a doggie door so they can go in and out as they please (dragging in water, mud, grass clippings, etc.). For four years I've been trying to keep my floors clean using a Roomba, old fashioned broom and dust pan, steam cleaner and mop and bucket.  I would usually at least sweep every evening and then spend half of a Saturday doing some serious floor cleaning.  I saw first saw this machine about a year ago, did a bunch of research, watched a lot of review videos and finally dusted off my wallet and bought one.  So glad I did!!  I have no complaints so far.  The suction is great and picks up all of the hair, dirt, grass and any other messes.  The mopping/roller part does an awesome job on the hardwood and tile!  I'm using the cleaner that came with the machine and it does not leave streaks on my floor.  The clean up process is easy and I don't mind it at all since I'm saving so much time with the machine.  I love it!!",7
S,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is an awesome product!,the United States,30-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have a long haired golden and two kids. Plus my husband. One is 1 and one is 9. This being said, we have a lot of messes. This machine cleans up my dog hair, and my kids cereal and other smaller messes everyday, at least twice a day. I do not know if it leaves dirty water behind though, because I haven't really paid attention. I do prefer to clean the water tank without having to touch the hair, but other than that its a decent cleaning tool and has cut down my cleaning time by at least half an hour and then some. I would recommend the bissell crosswave pro to most people, and I would also recommend using a different product then the pet pro formula as it leaves my hardwood floors looking greasy. I love this and cannot wait to see the next product upgrade they come out with.",2
Sarira Moslehi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Small filter and Mop Wet function doesn't clean at all!,the United States,10-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Major issues with this product:While the DRY suction on rugs is Ok, the filter surface area is very small and gets clogged so quickly that you need to clean it every 5 minutes or it starts smelling bad like burnt rubber and loses suction too.Also, the wet mop doesn't clean at all.I used it on my small kitchen floor which is relatively clean.After the first round which was 3 minutes, I noticed streaks of dirty water tracks from vaccume brush/tank on floor. So I washed the tank, brush, and filter, and then I used it once more. After 2nd time, I put it again in self cleaning mode for 30 seconds as per instruction, and rinsed n cleaned all parts. I used it again a third time on the kitchen floor.Then, to test the results, I mopped the floor with my Swiffer mop, and it was still dirty. See pictures.The amount of effort and time it takes to keep cleaning the parts and get this vaccume work is equal to mopping the floor 10 times in the old fashioned way!!Also, the separator sieve which is supposed to separate the dirty water from debris is so poorly designed with big holes in it that there is a lot of debris left in dirty water when you empty it which clogs the sink or toilet. Poorly designed, too much fuss, too little results! Returning! :/",One
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Vacuum Ever,the United States,20-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"*I'd like to preface this review by saying 2 things. The first is that I've had 5 vacuums, including this one, and all of them have been from the Bissell brand. It's safe to say that I love Bissell. This is the only one so poorly designed that I felt compelled to list all of the issues with this ""so-called"" vacuum in a review. The last thing I want is for another person wasting a couple hundred dollars on it just to throw it out the front door like I did...no, literally.I'll start with the pros because there are only a few: First, the concept. I love the concept of vacuuming and mopping at the same time. Ideally, this should cut down on the amount of time it takes to normally do both separately which is what I did for years. I had such high hopes of spending less time cleaning. I also like that it swivels, it's lightweight, and comes with a tray that it sits on for cleaning and storing the rollers.The cons: I don't even know where to start but I will say this. I read the manual. Yep. I read the manual because I wanted to make sure I did everything ""right"" with this vacuum. I took good care of this vacuum in the hopes that I would have it for years like my other Bissells. Here I am 8 months in wishing I would have listened to the negative reviews. In these 8 months, besides reading the manual I have also watched troubleshooting videos for the issues I was having. I watched them directly from Bissell and also from Youtube. I tried giving this vacuum the benefit of the doubt at every turn assuming it was user error (even though I’ve never had issues with any of my other Bissells, including the carpet shampooer). I watched videos on why it was leaving streaks, why it was leaving so much water on the floor, why there was clumping up of water and hair, and how to resolve each of those issues. I even tried vacuuming with my other vacuuming first to make sure that nothing could possibly clog this one because I thought that was why it was leaving so much water. Nothing worked… actually that’s a lie, something worked all right, and it was ME. This ""vacuum"" made more work for me than when I vacuumed and mopped separately. I would go over the floor with a towel because of how much water it left. I wasn’t even using the button to put water on the floor half of the time… it simply would not work the way it was designed. I’m leaving this review because if you read this, decide to buy it anyway, and soon after feel like you got a lemon do not wait like I did to return it, just return it and get your money back! That’s my biggest regret with this purchase. I will be buying a spin mop and going back to vacuuming and mopping.",One
Trista,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY,the United States,25-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,DO NOT BUY. This is my honest opinion. I LOVED this when I first got it. It’s a great idea in theory and worked on my moderately dirty hard floors the first 2 times I used it. I wish I could return it so badly but I can’t because I’ve had it for 3 months. The vacuum has lost suction and leaves DIRTY water on my floors. I clean it properly and thorough after each use and even use a bottle brush to gently clean out the suction tube. I know how to use it correctly. It has worked for me in the past but as time goes on it works less and less and I’ve only used it FIVE times because it’s such a hassle and pain in the butt to clean. I attached a picture of my swiffer wet jet pad after swiffering my freshly Bissell crosswaved floors. This is the second time I have had to clean up after the Crosswave and the second time the swifter pad was heavily soiled. I’m so disappointed that I didn’t listen to ALL of the other people giving this same type of review. Even personal friends warned me and I didn’t listen. Unless you have 300$ to throw away please just invest in something else.,2
Verified shopper 64,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good cleaning power.,the United States,25-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"With nothing but hardwood floors in the whole house, I’m glad I finally decided to ditch the old mop & bucket.  This is such a time saver.  The suction power is very strong — comparable to my dyson vac.  The cleaning power is as described.  With a tougher spot like dried ketchup on the floor, just hold it over the spot for a minute or  less and it’s gone.  The scent of the cleaning solution is nice. This package comes with 2 small bottles of solution which will do about 4 full tanks.  There is no streaking at all. After reading the reviews, I’m extra careful with the water tank and its cap which people say have broken easily.  I think yanking the tank out and shoving it back in would be a bit hard on that cap .... so just handle it carefully. It is a bit of a process to clean the machine.... but it is what it is.  Take everything apart, wash real well and let it dry out completely before reassembly.  It’s very important to use the cleaning tray!  I never did this with my other machines and that’s probably why they didn’t work real well and broke down.  Overall,  I’m very glad I purchased this machine.",One
OLD STUDENT,1.0 out of 5 stars,Most Disgusting thing I have ever used.,the United States,22-Feb-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was excited about this and then this morning used it for the first time.  It is absolutely the MOST disgusting vacuum I have ever owned.  It's suction is good, but utilizing the water/formula mix and performing a mop vac in a small area created a nasty mix of dirt, pet hair and water that mostly has to be removed by hand and what you can't get out by hand to put in the trash  goes down the sink which makes me want to vomit.  I don't know who classified this as Pet worthy, but they need to lose their job.  Unless they are only cleaning a room 5x7room area, this is not going to do the job that you want. I cannot even fathom what it would do on carpet.  Unfortunately I have now used this almost $300.00 ""vacuum"" and I don't guess I can return it.  Really disappointed in Bissell I have used their products for years.",5
Hope Navarrette,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t live up to my expectations,the United States,18-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited for this machine but it definitely didn’t live up to my expectations. As soon as it arrived I pulled it out of the box and tried it out. We have 3 dogs, 2 cats and hard surface floors throughout the house with a few area rugs so it seemed perfect. Within a few minutes the vacuum got clogged with wet hair. It left clumps of wet hair and a trail of dirty water. After using it once I was ready to send it back. I decided to try it again a few days later this time using the vacuum portion only first to get the hair and THEN the wet mop/vacuum. Still had trails of dirty water. It is super gross to clean out and I wiped the floor with a towel after to find that it was NOT clean. I feel like for spending $300 on a machine I shouldn’t have to have another vacuum to vacuum first (as some reviews suggest) and then use this. I’m just very disappointed.",2
Blayre,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product but not for me.,the United States,19-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It works well. I bought it because I have a toddler and little time to spend cleaning and we also have a puppy who isn’t potty trained so I thought this would help with messes. I went back and forth between getting the crosswave or the symphony (steamer vacuum combo) I decided crosswave for puppy messes but once reality hit, the clean up after was more work than just wiping it with paper towels. It did a good enough job vacuuming and mopping but I wouldn’t suggested it is an only means of cleaning hard floors. I did also try it on a rug and was extremely disappointed. It barely got it wet and the suction and brush just aren’t strong enough to do a really good cleaning. You’d still have to pre or post clean. Maybe it would work better on a thinner rug. Over all if I had quiet a few wet messes to clean daily I think it’s be worth the $300 but I will try the symphony and see if that does a better job for a cheaper price.",2
Randi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best invention ever!!!,the United States,5-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Where has this been my whole adult life!!!!If you have pets, kids or both this is a must!!!I have 2 Great Pyrenees, foster cats(anywhere from 2-6 cats in my home) have a hobby farm (goats, chickens, ducks, bunnies...) and 4 human kids.We purposely put laminate plank flooring in to hold up to the dogs and kids. I have to vacuum the main rooms daily. But moping was more like  once a week. This does an excellent job at picking up the long dog hair and all the dirt that’s brought in. And I love that I can tackle to task at once and mop at the same time!!!I researched this for several months before purchasing. And I read a lot of review that made me leery. But I’ve had it over a month and I’m still over the moon in love with it.1. My first suggestion is get extra brushes. I wash  and dry them between uses.  So it’s helpful to have some back ups. This seems to cut down on the “dirty streaks” others had complained about.2. Read the manual!!! Half of the complaints are addressed in the manual 🤦🏼‍♀️3. My dogs have long long fur, and it’s spring... but this powers through it like a champ. So I don’t know if they’ve fixed the long haired “pet issue” or what but it works for us.4. Yes cleaning the intake trap is gross! But I’d rather it be in there than on my floors... I really don’t see away around it, and I don’t really see it as a problem.5. I would say this is more for every day cleaning not a deep cleaning. I still plan to have my area rugs professionally cleaned 1-2x per year.",One
djones,1.0 out of 5 stars,DIES AFTER 3 MO. DONT WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$,the United States,25-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"it quit working after 3mo.  I bought one thru Walmart, and it worked great for 3mo. then lost suction, I replaced the filter and brush, it didn't help, but I so loved it when it worked that I got another one, the higher price Petpro, and it did the exact same thing. I called bissel they only wanted to replace it. Called Amazon and they gave me a credit for it and are now aware of the major flaw in this product.

Devin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing product- seriously!,the United States,21-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have three kids, two dogs, and a cat- and our floors have never been so clean. This product was recommended to me by a friend and after searching the internet I found that there were moms (and a few dads) everywhere who loved their Bissel Crosswave so I decided to order my own. It was worth every penny. It is easy to use and easy to maintain. I will never mop the old fashioned way again. My old routine was to sweep, vacuum, and then mop, now I sometimes sweep when there is a ton of dog hair and grubbies from the kids and then use the Crosswave for the rest. My floors used to take hours to clean, now it takes me about 30- 45 minutes to do my 2500 sq. foot house!! Last night my kids tracked in mud and I had it cleaned up in minutes.",3
Ana M. Schnellmann,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase for dog lovers!,the United States,12-Feb-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have two Goldens who track in mud several times a day, and they are copious shedders. This product is wonderful for keeping up with the mud! I sweep daily and mop a couple of times per week, so I was impressed and appalled with the amount of dirt this machine picked up! I did sweep up the loose hair before using the unit, but it still got a lot of hair off the ground. A few minor quibbles: I wish the formula left a shine on the floors. However, there are other products available. It was a bit difficult at first to figure out how to take out, clean, and replace the dirty water tank and the brush, but I am not good with machines, so I can't fault Bissell. It's not great on my area rugs, but does well on the floors. The floors have never been cleaner, and I was able to clean three rooms with only one tank. Overall, I am well pleased with the purchase.",9
Vanessa J. Otero,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,8-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had a Bissell vacuum that I loved, but my old roommate broke it. So I figured I'd buy this since it was less bulky and ""mopped"" as well as vacuum. Well, I was wrong. I have 3 pets and their fur is everywhere. No big deal, that's just the life of pets. However, I expected a vacuum to do what a vacuum should and at least suction up the hair. It doesn't. I can roll over hair or litter or anything else on the floor a hundred times and it still won't pick up. And don't get me started on the mop part. It's disgusting. Leaving dirty water streaks, smells terrible, cleaning the brush head after every room in the house doesn't help. It's ridiculous. I do not recommend and I usually love Bissell products. After a week, I'm returning it.",4

Two months of use, Equating to maybe six uses, it no longer vacuums or sucks up any pet fur.  It just clogs up at the brush underneath, Despite having to thoroughly clean every part, after each use.  I expected a lot better usage for the $300 I spent. It’s very disappointing.",9

Alison Stahl,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just used this for the first time. I ...,the United States,6-May-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I just used this for the first time.

So if you go down too far, you’re pulling the vacuum/mop off the floor entirely. But for weekly, quick floor cleaning, I’ll take it!",21
PJ,2.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted to like this vacuum but...,the United States,17-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to mop and vac my 3000 sq ft house with all laminate floor or tile. Especially to spot clean puppy messes.If doing the whole house you have to vacuum or sweep first or stop every 5 min to clean out tank.emptying the dirty water tank is a mess, the strainer catches very little and no matter how hard I tried it made a holy mess when emptying the strainer and tank.If cleaning puppy messes you must pick up all ""solid"" waste and wipe up the area, including all liquid, first, or it will spread it over your whole house.when going over a trim divider piece on the floor, all the debris on the roller will come off and you have to wipe it up. It does not get edges at all.When tackling a spot that was sitting for a while and dried it takes like 20 passes or moreThe area rug cleaner is a joke - it doesn't clean the rugs at all, just leaves them wet with all the debris from the roller left behind.This product came highly rated on several blogs as the best pet mess cleaner, the best dual purpose vacuum, etc. It doesn't steam clean well and it doesn't vacuum well.In summary, this is only good for floors and only good for spot cleaning. It has no attachments to clean up pet beds or toys like other products - it never claimed to, but for the price it should be good for something other than spot cleaning.",One

Our new home has carpet in 40% of the house and we figured this would eventually be needed. On the day it was delivered we put it in the closet without opening the box. That very same night, one of our very large dogs had explosive diarrhea downstairs/upstairs while we were sleeping. She then ate the diarrhea and vomited it up throughout the house. THAT woke us up. Half asleep, we remembered the Bissell Pet Pro - tore open the box, zipped through the 'short cut' how to use placard and had the mess (smell, stain, chunks....all of it) cleaned up in about 45 minutes. By the time our alarm clocks went off, the carpet was almost dry and there was no tell tale smell - only a fresh odor wafting through the house.

Thomas P. Daly,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Has potential, but more trouble than it is worth.  Not a time saver.",the United States,3-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was excited to get this product as we have floors that show everything and need regular cleaning.  The first thing I noticed was that the floor only got wet an inch away from the inside  edge of the vacuum, leaving a solid 2 inches of floor along the baseboards not cleaned, and you know nothing accumulates there.  Second, as others noted, it stinks like crazy if you do not go through the cleaning of the cleaner after each use, which is an involved process.  If you use this every day and clean it every other or maybe 3rd day, it might be worth the trouble, but with a corded product, I found I used it exactly twice.  After owning it less than 2 months and 2 uses, off to Goodwill it went.  I am back to a Dyson (Pet version) to vacuum and a bucket and mop for cleaning.  Compared to other cleaning products, this is maybe a $79 item.  I paid $299 for it and I am very disappointed at that price point, especially for a corded product.  I really can not imagine this being used past the novelty of getting it and then the guilt of spending $300 and the feeling you need to get something for your money.  I have other Bissel products I really like, but this one is just more hassle than the old school way of cleaning, at any price.",One
KB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Take negativity with a grain of salt.,the United States,19-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I almost didn't buy this because of the mixed reviews! I'm so glad I did because it makes a world of a difference. I have two dogs who are constantly dragging in dirt and shedding. I'm also a messy cook so our kitchen floor can be challenging. The crosswave has taken all the elbow grease out of cleaning the floors!Yes, it will leave streaks if you haven't rinsed out the brush or you've cleaned the whole house already. I bought a second brush and have had no issues. It takes a couple extra passes if, for example, someone has spilled coffee and let it dry. But that's a lot better than scrubbing on your hands and knees or trying to push harder with a mop. I get all the hardwood in the entire house (800+ sq ft) done in half the time and I'm not exhausted after. I'm never going to go back to a mop and you shouldn't either!!",2
Phyllis Cowart,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,14-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have been wanting to buy this for months.  I kept putting it off as I already had a ""mop"".  My cats both have ""accidents"" on the tile floor and I don't really see it right away. Trying to get it clean with a regular mop was so hard.  This is great.  I love the fact you don't have to vacuum first as it has a built in vacuum cleaner.  My friend walked in and immediately noticed the difference in the smell.  Yay!  I do love it!It has been a couple weeks and I've used it several times.  I wish I had bought the cordless one, though.  The cord is too short.  It doesn't go from my front room to my kitchen, which is right next to it.  Also, the cord is towards the bottom and I'm always having to reach down and grab it to get it out of my way.  It is always in the way.  When I wear this one out I'll get the cordless. :)",One
Terran,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not ready for prime time,the United States,24-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"A lot of issues, considering a return of product.The suction is okay, maybe too good as it doesn't have a ""reject the cord"" in place, and within a few feet of starting my first cleanup this machine sucked up a security camera power cord and by the time I could get the machine turned off and pulled the cord out the cord was a goner, so have to replace that!  It wants to suck in its own cord too, and because the cord is attached at the bottom of the unit it means bending over a lot to pick up the cord for maneuvering because it's otherwise in your way.  I mean, always in your way!The rug vacuum works okay but does leave some dust bunnies on the floor.It's a medium weight machine with fairly easy maneuvering except there is no option for a pullout attachment so secondary cleaning is necessary to get into the nooks and crannies to suck up those dust bunnies.This unit is okay for heavy traffic areas or quick clean-ups where you're not trying to get in and around other things, and stay clear of power cords that might be dangling - but were never an issue before!Finally, the cleanup operation afterwards is pretty extensive w many pieces involved and cleaned then left out to dry.In exchange for your former cleaning pattern you might wonder if this is worth it.UPDATE:  I returned the item on May 7 to a UPS shipping facility.  Got the receipt and later that day I got an email notification from amazon that my refund is issued.  Great, I thought.  So I got rid of the receipt from the shipping facility since our business was done once I verified the refund.  The shipping facility relays electronically the info off the shipping label so there no delays in notification of return of item but sometimes the boxes will ship later in the week when they have a lot of them OR if it's amazon they are supposed to pick up themselves because we have a local warehouse.  So shredded the paperwork I thought I no longer needed.  Now on June 1 I get an email notification that they have yet to receive the product.  Now my issue with the product is done once the return is transmitted and they have issued the refund.  But they say they issued the refund w/out any return of product.  Obviously a major screwup on their end.  Truth is Amazon has always been loathsome when it comes to customer service issues, from year one till now.The funny thing is after getting rid of the rotten Pet Pro I got the cordless to see if that would be a better product.  It is because it's cordless but it leaves just as much streaking and muddy water on the floor as the Pet Pro so I have been debating that return.  But that's another issue on the not-ready-for-prime-time Bissell line.Having experienced a four-customer service still no good resolution issue w Amazon on another issue (Amazon's own deceptive (let's say WRONG) listing for a product), this has been a hell of a few weeks.",One
Donna Roberts,5.0 out of 5 stars,I cant believe how much ick was in my supposedly clean carpets!,the United States,6-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This vacuum is awesome because you can see all the dirt and grime that you didnt even know was under your carpets.

Beth,5.0 out of 5 stars,WORTH IT,the United States,24-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This thing has changed our lives! We have 4 pets and deal with all the wonderful joys including pet hair everywhere. Our floors do not even appear dirty but after using this vacuum weekly the amount of dirt and grime I get up is astonishing. It’s gross but also incredibly satisfying! I love knowing that I’m really giving my house a good clean and this vacuum has helped me to do that. Recently my dog peed on our area rug I ran and got the vacuum and the cleaning solution and was able to get every last drop out of the rug. No smell, no stain I mean what pet owner doesn’t need a machine like that on hand? Worth every penny. It’s not hard to clean and the cleaning is worth it for how well it works.",2
Carol AnCel,1.0 out of 5 stars,The motor keeps BREAKING!,the United States,7-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought one a couple of years ago. Just under a year, the motor failed. I was told you had to store it all apart to keep that dry. They did honor the warranty and sent me a new one. Almost a year to the date.... the new one is making the same noise and I know what's coming. This time, it was taken apart EACH and EVERY time, never stored together and certainly never with any moisture. So that was not the reason first time around either. Poor design is what I suspect now.I am done. Though I have loved it, it's far too expensive for such  a short period of time.Going to be looking for a different brand now.I would suggest you all  save yourself the expense  and trouble and do the same.",2
T & T Foley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hard floor cleaner I've owned,the United States,26-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I owned an older Bissell Hard Surface cleaner and really liked it. However, it was 15 years old and a vital part broke and is not longer available. I am partial to the Bissell brand, I have had several Bissell cleaning products and have loved them all. I looked at reviews for current hard surface cleaners (and there's quite a variety) and decided to stick with Bissell. I have used it a number of times now and can write a useful review.ProsVery easy to assemble out of boxClean water/cleaning solution is easy to fill with clear markings on the bottleIt really cleans tile floors well. The older Bissell couldn't/didn't reach in the grout joints. This new model with the roller brush does clean down in the jointsIt is very light and easy to manipulateThe water/cleaning solution goes a long wayThe vacuum picks up 98% of the water leaving the floor almost dryThe rug setting does a good job on small throw rugs, etc. The manual clearly explains that this is not a carpet  vacuum cleaner for large areas.There is no need to vacuum or sweep first, before using the hard floor setting.Cleanup is quick and easy, however, if you have seen a commercial for the product, you might be led to think that all you have to do is set it in it's cleaning tray and press the switch. Not so; you still need to remove the roller/brush, front cover plate and dirty water tank and rinse them. It's still quick and easy and not really messy at allConsIt leaves about a 3/4"" gap at the wall or cabinet base that doesn't get cleaned. It would have been nice if one side or the other or the front was a 0 clearance. I tried using both sides and coming in perpendicular to the wall and there is still a strip that you can't cleanThere are two switches at the top front of the handle; one for hard floor cleaning and the other for rugs. It would be nice if the switch for each had a stiffer spring. In 'my' normal use, as I change position of my hand on the handle, I often hit the hard floor switch turning it on or off. A stiffer spring would require a conscious press of the button to turn it on or off.One more thing, and this is getting picky. The power cord connects at the bottom of the handle instead of higher up as most floor cleaners do. I prefer to keep one hand on the power cord so that I can flip it out of the way as I clean. There is a small clip near the top of the handle that the cord will slip into. Perhaps this was the thinking in placing it there.Overall, I would definitely purchase this floor cleaner again and recommend it to my friends. We have two large indoor dogs that shed, alot. This cleaner does a great job on pet hair, kibble on the floor etc.It seems there is always a sale on this device somewhere, look around, I don't think that you'll be sorry.",

Super easy to put together2. Super easy to maneuver3. Oh my goodnessssssss!!! I clean my floors 3-4 times a day because my crawling son has severe ezcema and he touches his face a lot and if the floors aren't clean hes touching his face with dirty hands making his ezcema flare!! So I'm like, it cant be THAT bad. I cleaned the kitchen and living room floors. Took me like 20 minutes. After I finished the brush was pretty much BLACK and the water was soooooooooooooooo dirty!!! I couldnt believe my eyes! I was able to clean up food stains and I have a cocker spaniel and it had no problem picking up her long hair or mine!!

Deena Crockett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Former house cleaner here. This machine is amazing.,the United States,7-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I flip flopped on buying this for some time because of negative reviews on here. I wasn't sure which reviews were user error and which weren't. I've had the machine for 3 weeks now and I have some notes:•I have a German Shepherd, 4 cats, and mostly hard floors with an area rug and 2 rooms with standard carpet.•If you are expecting this to be a vacuum that can handle wet messes, you are mistaken. This is like the absolute best mop that goes above and beyond what other mops can do.•I have absolutely thrown my worst at this machine and here's what it can/can't handle....1. Can't handle standard carpeted floors. It actually does really well for spot cleaning stains on carpet, but won't work like a regular vacuum. So don't chuck out your old vacuum. However, I'm betting it would tackle a berber carpet fairly well. But a standard 1 inch pile carpet is just too far.2. Dry time for area rugs is really good. I start with my area rug first, and by the time I do the rest of the floors and clean the machine, the rug is pretty much dry.3. This is the perfect machine for daily cleaning your floors. If you have a double coated dog during shedding season and it's been a few days since you've cleaned the rug, you should certainly give it a once over with a vacuum before using this machine. Otherwise, it'll get hair absolutely stuffed in the vac tube and won't work effectively till you clean it out.4. I would not recommend vacuuming up piles of cat liter with this, just on principle. A little is fine, but the small tank and everything just really makes the idea of water and clumping litter going into the same tank a recipe for disaster.5. Make sure you take the air filter out and clean under it. The first use and it was absolutely stuffed. It's a small space and just needs cleaned. But overall, disassembly is super easy for cleanup.Overall, this machine is a win and a wonder for me. I have chronic illness and I do not have the energy to vacuum my floors and then go back and mop. Doing it all at once is amazing and so easy I don't find any problem doing it daily. Also, as a former professional cleaner, I wish I had this when I was cleaning other people's homes. It would have been so amazing and saved me so much backbreaking labor and time. I love this thing. I just wish it had a hose so I could so my stairs.If you've read the negative reviews and wondered if they were legit issues or user errors, in my opinion they are likely user errors.",One
Audrey Reeves,5.0 out of 5 stars,Test with a paper towel,the United States,2-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If you use it correctly, you will get AMAZING results. The hype around this machine is 100% valid. I used this in a tile bathroom then took a paper towel to the floor while it was still damp. The paper towel was WHITE. It gets all the little things the vacuum misses and even the grout on the floor looks clean.Here’s some tips I’ve learned:• If you have a ton of pet hair, vacuum before using the crosswave. It’ll save you a ton of time in the end. Cleaning hair out of the machine is not fun.• Take your time. Go over each spot much slower than you would with a vacuum. You’ll be able to see where you’ve cleaned and where you haven’t.• If you’re doing a big area or your floors are really gross, stop partway and rinse out the crosswave with the tray that came with it.• Empty the dirty water after EVERY use. Unless you have a VERY strong stomach, do not wait on this• Rinse the machine when you’re done using it for the day. It makes actually cleaning the crosswave much much better (it will STINK if you leave it even overnight)• If the floors are streaky, SLOW DOWN. Try finishing the machine too. Your floors are much grosser than you realize• Don’t be stingy with the trigger for the cleaner. If the floor is dry after you pass over it, you need to use the trigger more. Don’t hold it the entire time you clean either.",One
tina mcgill,2.0 out of 5 stars,Torn,the United States,25-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So I was very excited to get this and even gave away my brand new very good vacuum because this is everything i needed.  First let me state, I do like it, It cuts my cleaning time in half as it does vacuum and clean at the same time.I enjoying cleaning my area rugs as I have a dog and cat and helps with odors. HOWEVER, as soon as I purchased this i saw a self cleaning one , which I wish I had because cleaning this is the WORST!!! It does not separate dry/wet area like I thought so i literally have to clean this in my bathroom to dump A LOT of wet nasty dirty hair down the toilet as I wouldnt be able to dump the liquid in my trash and it gets EVERYWHERE. as i have to pull out this plastic thing which is covered in ""ick"" out first, which i found out after it fell in toilet.  While it has a ""cleaning"" stand that you pour water in and it ""self cleans"" it does not clean the bristle head, which is entangled with hair and also has to be cleaned by hand.  The vacuum itself WILL NOT GET UNDER BEDS and has no flexibility in that end.  lastly the FILTER... SMELLED SO BAD after I used it.  I took it out to wash it out /clean it and put it back and it dried with the worst mildew/wet dog smell ever. and I literally soaked it in lysol, the cleaner it comes with and then bleach for 48 hours and it was still black but smelled better. so order more as the suction of the vacuum is not good if you dont have it in there.  I am trying this long review because I see that some of these issue were developed like the Brush head cleaner.  and maybe properly inform customer on cleaning and buying filters etc.I spent a lot of money on it and wish i knew these things.  as well as being able to get under beds.",One
Rich Brewers,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE BEST,the United States,5-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This product is the BEST. My floors are CLEAN. I have a Lab who sheds everywhere! I couldn't believe how dirty my floors were in the dirty water holder after cleaning. I researched this product for a few weeks making sure it was worth the money and I can honestly say that it is!Negatives: The only complaint I have is that the dirty water holder fills up quick. Depending on how big your home is, you may have to clean it out 2-3 times during cleaning.Overall, My advice would be to ALWAYS clean out the vacuum/mop and all of it's parts after each time you use it and make sure it's ALL dry before put all the parts back. Make sure to read the instructions when the product comes in. A lot of the bad reviews that are on here won't happen if they ended up just reading the instructions. I was debating on getting the Pet Pro vs. All in one Multi Surface and the only difference is the strainer. I went with this one but I don't think you could go wrong with either one. I did get 2 brushes plus two small bottles of the formulas with this purchase and I'm not sure if you would get the same with the other vacuum. This purchase was WORTH IT.",2
David,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Wife’s New Ride.,the United States,18-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for my wife, and to be honest I thought most women, like guys don’t mind getting new tools, or things to make doing chores easier. Don’t get me wrong she likes it, and said it’s the best thing for cleaning hardwood flooring, and tile. Though I got an earful about how women rather get gifts like new purses, or jewelry. We probably have had it about four months now, and it’s still getting the floors cleaned. I would suggest buying an extra bottle of the bosses cleaner, along with another roller head. If you use the same roller 2-3 times a week for a month straight, we found that’s about what we can get out of them. Though we have three teenagers, and two large German Shepherds. Well that’s about it for my .02 cents.",One
Brenda Bonk,2.0 out of 5 stars,NOT USER FRIENDLY AND NOT GREAT FOR OWNERS OF SUPER SHEDDERS,the United States,29-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This model is not the best for what I needed it for.. cheaply made and was a little puzzling putting it together.  The first time I used it, I thought, but was wrong for my purposes, that I could scrub the floor without having to sweep or vacuum first like it says in the commercial.. I was wrong.. big time!  It stopped sucking up the water.  The reason being was it was clogged with dog fur. Let me preface this by saying I have a large German Shepherd (Major Shedders!) and a large Golden Retriever, who is kind of a sneaky shedder meaning when you brush him there isn’t much fur in the brush but all of a sudden there is fluffy gold fur balls tumbling around the floor. We sweep or vacuum daily to every other day.  Well I had to totally disassemble the machine to unclog it.  There are places the fur gets into, like unnecessary crevasses and holes that aren’t really necessary to the design of this product.  The chamber the dirty water or floor dirt for vacuuming today was totally clogged up with fur and there is a tube or cylinder that goes down the middle of the collection chamber that was full of fur.  All I have to say is the team that designed this product obviously didn’t have big super shedding dogs.  Would not recommend for people with similar situstions to mine.  BTW.. I’ve used it twice and already don’t care for it.  Probably will sell it in my rummage sale and I haven’t completed paying for it yet which BTW was too much money for what I got, a very cheaply made poorly designed product..",
Dancingwords,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, so glad I gave this a try!",the United States,7-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"My review is so positive that I feel I must preface it by saying that it was not solicited by anyone. I do not know anyone who works for Bissell, I don’t even know where they’re located.  I bought this based upon some reviews here on Amazon, but upon mostly a wing and a prayer. I have bought many upright vac products in my lifetime.Out of the box, this vac & mop (yeah, right...Right?) was a piece of cake to start using. My only complaint in this entire review would be that is heavy, but if they changed even one thing I think I would’ve been dissatisfied.  I do have a single floor home. I have had many heavy up right vacs that were completely unmaneuverable. They turn a certain way, and you have to pick them up to right them, or get them to turn another way.  This vac/mop was easy to maneuver. At first, I hand-vac’d the corners & egdes; so used to them Not being taken care of.  Eventually I tired of this and was amazed that I didn’t need to do so to begin with. I have two German Shepherd’s who shed their weight each year (I promise, my only exaggeration). If you have dogs you know what I’m talking about. I have hardwood floors and they also drip water rivers every time they drink, and this creates a certain kind of mud only a dog lover could, well, love. The final kicker is, I have fibromyalgia. And believe me, it feels many times like the final kicker.  Many times it is come between a choice of putting up with the little muddy rivers - alone - or having my faithful and loving companions. I choose my companions.  When I can get up the energy to clean, I would first vacuum. Then mop. I was exhausted (& hurting) by the time it came to mop.This machine took up all the hair and mopped the floor beautifully at the same time. This almost sounds anti-climactic.  But if you could Be here, and feel how I felt when I flew through the Clean house, you might say it felt as good as if someone else had done it!!Give it go.  Somebodies busted their...did a great job, so I could too.  Sorry to sound corny, but I want to be honest.  T. Gautier, CA",One
Jeff,4.0 out of 5 stars,Review with tips,the United States,2-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"OK so this combo is good if you follow a few tips.  DO NOT use anything but Bissel solution in this.  I didn't listen and used my own concoctions.  Vinegar, ammonia, murphy's oil, whatever.  Terrible decision.  Not only does this clog the machine but it does not leave your floors without a residue.  The Bissel solution, whatever it is, leaves no residue.  I'm using this on carved hardwood, tile and waterproof luxury vinyl plank.  If you are an idiot like me there are 2 ways to mitigate this problem.  You must use compressed air on the front clean panel in the EXTREMELY tiny holes you cannot even see that suck up water and solution to blow out gunk.  Next you will destroy the filters.  BTW DO NOT BUY aftermarket filters.  They do not work at all and you will not be able to pull the solution off the floor.  If you don't notice solution being picked up when you vacuum over it the filter is no longer good.  Another hard lesson I learned.  In fact don't even rinse the filters. leave them as is and replace them often.  This means this cleaner will cost you some dough with solution and replacement bissel filters.  Not cost effective but when you mop and just slosh you cleaning agents over the floor you never really pick up all the filth.  Been doing that for years.  Suction is actually nice and would be fine if this was just a hardwood floor vac.  Get some replacement roller too.  Is it worth it???? It's pricey but will clean your hard floors nice if you don't go rogue like me with solutions and aftermarket parts.",
Nico,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great on matte porcelain tile,the United States,25-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I originally bought the no-name version of this and returned it because it didn’t work well whatsoever on my matte porcelain tile house. Sprung for the money on this one and I’ve used it two times. Loved it both times. I clean my floors about once a week or once every two weeks because I have a robot vacuum that does the hard duty work daily for me.The reason why I returned the no-name brand was because it would not clean the dog water slobber spots or cup drips off of my floor. I would have to scrub them manually, which defeats the purpose of spending money on a floor cleaner. So far so good with this Bissell. I got the pet version with the strainer, which is extremely helpful because I I have long hair, my husband is furry, and we have a very furry dog. Makes it way easier to clean the dirty water out. So far so good. I don’t mind the cleaning process at the end.This beats the hell out of manually Swiffering for 35 minutes and being a sweaty mess with sore hands and shoulder, versus barely breaking a sweat in 20 minutes with this product. I don’t mind it has a cord either because I hate it when batteries run out of things and you have to wait three hours later while it charges to finish the job.Overall I definitely recommend this, but I’ve only used it twice. So crossing fingers this thing holds up. I have a 1500 square-foot area and it takes me 2.5 tanks of water and about 20 minutes to clean.",

Kris Fregin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money,the United States,2-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Where do I start.  If you have a dog that really sheds, then you still need to sweep before you mop.  You need to go over your floor multiple times with the Bissell to get it clean.  It does not suction up the water from your floor as it implies it will do (my receptacle container had less than one cup of water in it after using 2 full containers of the water / cleaning solution).  The self cleaning brush feature is seriously more of a chore than just throwing my old mop's re-useable cloth in the washing machine. All-in-all, it takes me less time to just sweep and use the old mop.  My Bissell Crosswave is sitting in the corner taking up space as I mop around it with my good old Liberman mop.",One
bsjhaley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, easy to use and does a great job!",the United States,24-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I would have to say at first I was skeptical. I was expecting the machine to be heavy based on a review but it is not it is lightweight. Exceptionally easy to put together I mean all you have to do is snap the handle in place LOL. I purchased the Bissell Pet Pro crosswave with the 80 oz sanitizer solution. But the machine came with two small bottles of pet Pro cleaner. I used one bottle and cleaning my large house. I did have to stop halfway through to empty the container and refill the solution bottle. I did put the machine on the base and wash the brush before I continued to do the rest of the house. We have a laminate planking hardwood floors and it did a great job. The floors were sparkling clean and the house smelled great. The machine was very easy to empty and to clean as well. The only downside is I could say is the solution bottle would be great if it was a lot bigger but it is not necessary because it holds a lot. If you do not remember to keep an eye on the dirty canister the brush can spread the dirt back on the floor when you lower the volume too low to vacuum under stuff. That is how I knew that I needed to empty the dirty water container. I was having such a great time I forgot LOL. I would highly recommend this 4 all ages. I am 55 and found it very easy to use. Take your time while cleaning so you get the job done good.,
TT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Convert from Hoover Floormate,the United States,11-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was a long time Hoover Floormate user.  In fact I've probably owned and worn out six of them.  I decided to try Bissell after watching their commercial and the good works put towards pets.  I'm wondering what took me so long.  After just one use, not only did it clean my tile and area rugs better, the working parts were way more easy to clean.  It used less water and cleaned at least 5x better than my last hoover.  I loved hoover floormate and thought that I was just wearing them out cuz i'm always washing my floors.  I guess you don't know any better till you try a superior product!  I love how you can clean the roll afterwards in the clean station provided.  This is by far a well thought out and designed product.  I'm a convert!  thanks Bissell for a terrific product.",2
Naturally Ashlie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Treasure Truck Buy!,the United States,19-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this while on Treasure Truck special for quite a bit less than it normally goes for. For what I paid for it, I love it. It cleans the floor better than what normal mopping would, always uses clean solution, and not needing to sweep beforehand is a huge timesaver.I did use it on floors that were filthy after moving into a home that hadn't been cleaned beforehand. There were some spots that I had to manually scrape off the floor, but I don't think it was the fault of the Bissell, even hard scrubbing probably wouldn't have taken it off.It works wonderfully and I don't see needing to use anything else to get a deep clean. However, it doesn't work great in tight areas, especially tight corners. Some maneuvering angles lift the head up and completely make the scrubbing feature useless since there's not any contact.Other than needing to manually mop some tight areas like behind the toilet, this thing handles it all.I also wanted to note that cleaning it is super straight forward. It's not anymore taxing than other floor cleaners, but having a step by step system to clean it after use ensures you get the biggest bang for your buck, reducing how often the roller would need to be replaced, as well as keeping it in like new condition.",
Asha Moosai,5.0 out of 5 stars,DONT THINK JUST BUY IT,the United States,10-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I spent A LOT of time researching which vacuum to get. Read blogs, poured over reviews etc. I finally narrowed it down to a couple, but with 3 cats and a smidgen of OCD: this was the clear winner. I've had this vacuum for about two weeks and I Have not one complaint BESIDES that I have to take everything apart to leave it to dry. But what else can I expect with a wet/dry vacuum. This really leaves you floors feeling clean and you can TELL by the colour of the dirty water how much grime it gets up even if you think the floors are clean. The suction power and swivle power is real! And I have not had any issues with hair mine or feline tangling in the brush roll and it's quite easy to rinse and dry.

K2F,2.0 out of 5 stars,Streaky and Sticky,the United States,14-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to receive this. We have nothing but hardwood and tile surfaces in our home, plus an elderly, blind pet who occasionally misses the pee-pee pad.It was easy to assemble. It maneuvers well enough. The suction wasn’t up to par with a regular vacuum and bits of food, pet fur, etc. were left behind.Worst of all — and it’s not easy to this in this video, but crystal clear in person — the brush doesn’t evenly touch the surface. After poor results, I took it apart serval times and made sure it was clear and clean. I changed out the brand new brush (it comes with two). Made sure I had the water and cleaning agent filled to the “large area” level.Per the instructions, I held the lever to dispense the cleaning agent for 10 seconds, then began to swipe the vacuum up and down the floor. The first swipe of the machine would produce an even swipe of fluid on the floor. But after that, the brush only seemed to touch down with the very middle of the brush and outer edges. The next swipe would only cover the very outer edges.The only way I could get the brush to evenly clean the floor was to continually hold the dispensing button — and then it’s too much. Finally, it left a cloudy film on the floor.I’m so sad, but it’s two big thumbs down. We’ve had it for a couple weeks and hope to return it.",One
Karen L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy I finally made this purchase!,the United States,25-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Thought about this purchase for awhile and finally did it. I LOVE this vacumn! Its has great suction,and is very easy to maneuver. Also, its not difficult to assemble or disassemble after use for cleaning. Read the directions(there are only a few ) and get to know your machine. It stops sectioning when the filter needs to be cleaned and a snap to clean and get back to work. I read a review who had muddy water coming out of her machine. If you fail to put the little white filter back in after cleaning it will do that. Rather have a little muddy water on the floor than in my new bissell.The bissell cleaner isn't a cover up either. It seems to neutralize pet odors which I love.I was not paid or rewarded for this review in any way. I make purchase decisions based on others reviews and try my best to contribute when I can.

Frances,5.0 out of 5 stars,five star purchase for me,the United States,13-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This review is for hard wood and vinyl floors only.I have nothing negative to say about this vacuum. 5 star purchase. In my home, I have a mastiff (lots of hair and slobber) and at my parents' home we have 4 dogs that go in and out freely. I run an iRobot on both houses during the week. On the weekend, I really clean the floors. This machine saves me so much time. Before the Crosswave, I would do a pass with a regular vacuum, then a pass with the swifter rag, then mop. Afterwards, mopping ALWAYS left streaks and the floors look dull. If if put oil on them, my elderly mother cannot walk safely and the old dog (we lost him last night, RIP Henry) would slip. I may run around and sweep the corners as and baseboards while the iRobot runs (if needed), but all I have to do is one vacuum run. I am using the Bissell floor solution (light ""fresh"" scent) that comes with it and the vacuum and solution combo leaves the floor very shiny, but not slippery and no streaks. I may have to soak the mastiff's glue-like slobber and come back a minute later.Trick - when cleaning it after use, I dump the dirty bin out. Then put it back on. I mix hot water and vinegar, dump it on the clean floor in front of the vacuum and slowly suck it up. I do this two, three times max. The way the brush spins, it is self cleaning. Let is spin a minute to spin the water off. I then take the brush out and set it to dry and then rinse everything else off. Oh, and I also sanitize the filter with a little 70% isopropanol. Not sure how the manufacture thinks about that, but it works for me. I clean it well after each use, so no smell issues.",One
Debbie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too Good to be TRUE!!!,the United States,6-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This sweeper was fantastic,  at first!!! I cleaned the whole vacuum after each use. As much as I paid, i was going to keep it clean. That only took 5 minutes,  so nothing time consuming, or hard to do.It was great at picking up dog hair, as well as my own. It was fantastic sweeping and washing the floor. June of 2019 was its one year anniversary and it started  to act up. Not cleaning as well, and down performance over all. 3 weeks ago, it acted over heated and shut off. I had not even used it 15 mins.  So I waited, and two days later, same thing. I tear it apart to see if I had missed a clog, or something around the roller, nope not that. So i tried again, and it ran, but once i engaged the roller and solution, it immediately shut off. I called Bissell to trouble shoot it. Very nice lady who tried to help. She authorized a local sweeper repair store to look at it.It turns out that beside mine, he has, 2 other crosswaves, and he is waiting on something from Bissell, and the other crosswaves have been waiting longer! This is not a cheap machine! I expected a lot more than one year!!!Bissell  was a name I trusted and have bought several carpet cleaners from them that are like the energizer bunny! Almost 4 weeks now,  still no crosswave or any idea as to what Bissell is going to do.I would advise you not to buy this vacuum.  It obviously has a problem that Bissell has not fixed. Back to my floor pads and bucket of water!UPDATE: 12/24/2019:  I waited over 4 weeks and finally had it. The repair shop could not get a hold of them, or on hold forever. I called and spoke to a clerk and like the first, wanted to help but could not. I gave him a week to get this sorted or I would file a complaint.  I followed that up with an email to the company.  I asked for a replacement, or my money back, explained the facts and why I bought Bissell.  Gave them a week or I was filing a complaint. A week later, the repair shop called. He had our replacement, as well as replacements for the other ones he had too. So we shall see.... If this one does not last a year, I will request a refund.",One
Terea Hauck ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pros/cons,the United States,28-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Pros- excellent suction power, mops fairly quickly, easy to assemble and fairly easy instructions. Deep cleans carpets and removes hard, stubborn and old stains (I was very impressed) smells great while cleaning!Cons- very, very hard to push/pull on my shag rug, so much so that I’m considering returning it. Will not vacuum my cowhide rug. It sucks it right up in the vacuum because the suction is so strong, so all lightweight rugs will probably do this. The cord sucks! I should have gotten one without one. You’d think for this price they would at least have a retractable method but they don’t.Only issue I truely have with this product is the fact that it’s SO hard to vacuum myShag rug, other than that, it’s a win!",One
Cornerstone83,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am allergic to everything, have an autoimmune dis. and this VACUUM SAVED MY PETS!!!",the United States,16-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I am a vacuum freak! I am from the west coast; I never had allergies and over the last 3 years due to my disease my family has had to migrate east. We have now landed in beautiful Aledo, TX. We live on 0.4 acres in the ""countryside,"" with a cat, 3 young girls, a dog and ALL THE BUGS IN TEXAS!! I was having major issues getting the feeling of oxygen filling my lungs and after my recent allergy testing, I find out I am allergic to EVERYTHING AROUND ME: MY CAT, mites, grass, cedar, cottonwoods, crickets-46/56 of the antigens they use for allergy testing (2 are controls, so 48/56 as ) lol. Anyways for me it goes for the throat and then they make it feel like i am being attacked by small invisible bugs eaten all over up my legs to the point i want to cut them off-so I vacuum! BUT it just doesn't fix it all the way. the pet pro does!!! Seriously it's insane! Perfect amount of fluid (I use Melaleuca, it's water based) and then it sucks up the fluids upon drawing back the vacuum and it gets every single hair, mite, or biting invisible bug,  ALL OF IT!!!! I am not coughing, rubbing eyes, raw throat, swollen throat, not being able to swallow! i am good to go for 4 days! and it's a one pass all together vacuum wash and dry my entire 2500 sq ft tile home!

Leeza,5.0 out of 5 stars,YES ITS FOR CARPETS,the United States,9-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant in buying the vacuum because everyone who bought used it for either hardwood floors or rug carpets and my house is strictly carpet. I took a chance and I am SO HAPPY that I did! I vacuumed with my regular one the day before it arrived and after I vacuumed/cleaned the carpet with this one the results were amazing! It grabbed a crazy amount of dirt and dust and I will vouch for this product forever! Cleanup is the easiest thing ever and honestly doesnt take too long. 10-15 min max. However, this does NOT replace a deep clean in my opinion. Other than  that perfect for every day use! Just make sure to read and follow the instructions for cleaning.",7

MrsHarris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing!,the United States,22-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE 5/26/20: Well.. it broke. And so did my heart. Looking into how to get a replacement now, because I love this thing so much. And for it to die a month later makes me so sad. Very disappointing.Y'all... This just arrived Tuesday and I feel like my life is forever changed.Truly.I had been waiting since before Christmas to buy this. I kept looking over reviews on this and other things. I'm not the type to spend a chunk of money on things like this.WHY DID I WAIT?!I am SO glad I finally got this thing.Just let the nice people take your money and hand this bad boy over. Trust me.Why was this so life changing? Well...So, for perspective of what I'm working with here... We have 8 dogs. Yeah. 8. Sometimes more. Insanity, I hear you say? Well.. yes. It's fine, though. Everything is fine.On top of 8 dogs we have 3 small kids and 3 adults living in this house. And we have a small farm... And it's Texas and it rains a lot.So we have mud. Lots of mud. And dogs. And children. And mud. Did I mention mud??So. Much. MUD.Our floors are stamped and stained/painted concrete and it's lovely most of the time, but also a pain to clean because it's WHITE.White floors + 8 dogs + 3 children + mud =Do you see where I'm going with this?? It's terrible. Like... The worst.My daily floor care routine consisted of sweeping and then mopping with my O Cedar spin mop. Which I love. It's been the best little mop. But it also kills my back. Because with mud, you have to scrub. Especially if life interrupts and the mud DRIES.Anyway. So I did this horrid routine at least once a day, twice if it was raining, and spot mopping every time the dogs came inside as well.Can you say time consuming?And yet still I never felt like my floors were REALLY clean. It's maddening.So, I bit the bullet and decided to invest in my sanity and time a bit and cough up the money for this thing, in hopes that it would cut my time cleaning a bit, and perhaps save my back from hurting so much.I honestly had low expectations. I figured it probably wouldn't have great suction, and that the mop portion may not help a ton, but would at least be good for fresh mud, and so worth it for the constant spot cleaning, at the very least.Amazon got this to me by Tuesday. So I haven't had it very long, but I have put this thing through the wringer and it has come through the other side a valiant champion!I asked my husband if it could sleep in the bed with us... He wasn't amused. I just feel like it's earned it's place.Ok, so to start off my test run of it, I took on the hallway that I had let build up dirt over the week to see how it would do on that.Now. It did take time and slowly working it over the area, but it managed to get up all of that grossness that was on my floor. I was impressed! ... And slightly disgusted as the dirty tank revealed everything. Ick.. but also glory be!In celebration, and on a euphoric high, I decided to hit the living room, which I had previously mopped earlier that morning before the glorious arrival of this amazing machine.I cleaned out the dirty tank and refilled the clean tank and went to work.Wow! And again, gross... I can't believe how much yuck that was still on my floor after I had already ""cleaned"" it. Gag.I went on to do my whole house, and was simply in constant amazement. ""Babe!! Look at it NOW!!""I'm fairly certain my husband was over looking at the Crosswave doing it's thing, but he humored me anyway and congratulated me each time. I love that man.Now, I mentioned earlier that I have 8 dogs, right? Well I forgot to mention 2 of those 8 dogs are German Shepherds, aka German ""SHEDDERS."" SO. MUCH. HAIR.All the hair. There's never not a hair tumbleweed in my house. Don't like hair? Don't get a German Shepherd. Great dogs. Lots of hair. The hair should be more terrifying than their bark.I have tried many vacuums in the past and because of my GSDs (ok and probably my long hair as well), I don't buy vacuums with roller brushes. It just never goes well. Hair gets caught in the roller, becomes useless, cutting it off it's often a pain or even impossible. No more roller brushes.That was a HUGE reason for my hold up on the Crosswave. Even though it promised to combat this, I was skeptical.Y'all... They followed through on their promise. So far-- and I've vacuumed up A LOT of hair-- hair has not been getting caught up in the roller. It DOES get a little bit just on the edges of the roller, where it fits into the maxhine, but it's so super easy to get off, I don't even count that.So huge win right there.It's been great at sucking up all that hair too! It isn't the strongest suction out there, but it is pretty great and definitely gets the job done! When I walk around barefoot I don't feel any dirt, hair, or grains of yuck! I loooove it.The tank is small, so it doesn't fit a ton of hair in there. So if doing some major cleaning it does require frequent emptying. I was essentially already doing that with sweeping and mopping anyway, so no big deal.The tank is super simple to clean out and I LOVE that they made a strainer for hair and solid items. I pull that thing out and dump the hair straight into the trash. And then dump the dirty tank out and rinse that. There is also a filter in there that needs to be checked, especially if you've done some dry vacuuming. A screen is over that catches hair and makes it easier to clean out.Overall I LOVE how easy the machine is to clean.The station really is good at cleaning off the brush like it's supposed to.Oh! Another great thing that exceeded my expectations. It doesn't leave a ton of water behind on the floor! I even used it on my hardwood floors and it did magnificent! It leaves very little water behind so it dries very quickly! It did great on our tile floor as well. :)So. Even with having to drag it across the floor slowly, taking my time, cleaning out the dirty tank frequently, and cleaning the machine after each use, it really is saving me a ton of time! I have been able to get so much more done in a single day thanks to this little beast! It combines sweeping and mopping, and there's just no argument there.It's fairly lightweight and easy to move around. Nothing like my old lug of a Kirby, but it is heavier than some things, like maybe a stick vacuum. I mean, it has a tank of water soooo..I love that the head swivels! With little effort too! I was able to get to spaces quite easily and loved that!One thing on the head to note, it does not clean flush up to the wall! It does vacuum all the way there, but not mop. The brush can only get so far. So there's about an inch gap there. I plan to just clean those spaces when I'm doing baseboards or go over it with a mop. Not a biggie for me, but definitely worth noting for others!My other favorite thing is that my back is no longer aching! I'm 5'4"" and I don't have to bend over oddly, or put any pressure into it to get the job done! I can stand up straight and use this perfectly fine. Hooray! This alone is giving me so much more energy and motivation to get more done through the day! Not to mention that I'm far less crabby when I'm not in pain. Eek.Overall I think this machine is a fantastic addition to my home and has definitely simplified my life already, giving me more time, less aching, and a far cleaner floor.I HIGHLY recommend the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro Plus to anyone struggling with the floors and looking for a little peace in their lives.",2
Rachel Hulpke,5.0 out of 5 stars,Starting to think I should work for Bissell as a salesperson,the United States,25-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Ok so some things are just too good to be true like vacuuming and mopping at the same time. Or so thought. I’ve bought items like this in the past and I’ve always been disappointed. Well someone finally got it right! Thank you Bissell!! This machine is AMAZING!!! I clean houses for a living and my clients floors have never been cleaner. I have a client that will only let me use her stuff and I was so bummed last time I left her house because I couldn’t get that amazing clean I have been getting with the Crosswave. I have to admit that it is taking me longer the first time I use it in a house but after that first time it gets easier and the dirty water is even getting lighter. For whatever reason the floors are actually staying cleaner in between cleans. And best part is I have been cleaning my own floors more! Which is something I never wanted to do after cleaning all day. I talk to everyone that will listen about this product and I should probably be getting a commission from Bissell soon. ;-),2

Kara P.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it at first but it slowly lost it’s appeal for me.,the United States,28-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Update sept 2021:Dropping to one star. This thing does not suction much anymore and it doesn’t clean well at all.Despite using newer brushes and filters.At this point I’m pulling out my broom and mop more often than the spin mop, it cleans far better and is way more efficient.Less than two years later and at this price I’m extremely disappointed.I’m not going to bother with repair cause I’ve fought that battle with other Bissell products and it’s always fruitless.I purchased this vacuum mop in April of 2020. I’m writing this in January 2021.I purchased this mop to clean my LVT, in particular a very high traffic area that needs cleaned frequently.At first it was LOVE! It did such a beautiful job cleaning. I used it every other day, mainly in the entryway of my home(the high traffic area referenced earlier).We unfortunately wear shoes in our home. So we get tons of dirt tracked in as a family of 6.We also have 3 cats, 2 of which have kidney disease, so we needed something that could clean cat puke and pee.Initially this mop could clean up the dirt and marks on the floor with ease and left zero residue or smudges.Over time it stopped doing as well and left smudges everywhere so I bought new brush rolls, all Bissell brand.Still had smudges.So then I bought new filters, off brand, and they did not help and actually seemed to work worse.I decided to buy a bissell filter which seemed to help a slight bit but the mop still left marks and smudges.I even tried one of the non pet brush rolls and had the same issue.When I mop I will have to go over the same area just to pick up all the water, which will not seem to get sucked up as easily as before.This mop will also leave a line along the wall where the brush can not reach which means you have to clean that area separately.On the plus side, when I have a spill it makes things so much easier to clean and leaves hardly any sticky residue like a regular mop. At first it would leave zero sticky residue and now it leaves a slight bit.It works great on cat puke and urine. So that’s a plus.Overall, I’m not super happy with this mop anymore. It makes me so sad because it was so great at first!",
buster,1.0 out of 5 stars,This machine does not work.,the United States,9-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased in Jan 2020.  First time I used it, it did not clean my wood floor.  I mopped it right after with a SH Mop and my terry cloth cover was dirty.  So the roller does not pick up the dirt.  Second time I used it the sprayer clogged up so no water went on the floor to clean it.  Every time I use this machine something does not work.  Roller,sprayerdon't work properly.  The dirty container is not easy to clean.  The filter is a mess that you need to clean each time.'Bottom line it takes about 15 minutes to get it working and does not clean floors plus clean up on machine takes about 20 minutes each time.  Do not buy this product.",3
Danielle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money!!,the United States,4-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Definitely not worth the money. I went back and forth or whether or not I wanted to buy this! A few months ago, while shopping, I actually had this in my buggy. I wanted it, but I could not bring myself to pay over $300 for a bissell.. I have no prob spending money on things that last- example: I love dyson! If dyson came out with a similar product, I’d buy it and not hesitate! So, anyways, while having this in my buggy, I came across a swiffer wetjet and thought “psh, I’ll spend $20 and put this bissell back Bc I’m not completely sold on it yet!” So that’s what I did. I do love my swiffer wetjet, best 20 bucks spent! But I bought the bissell while on sale.. & that’s how I talked myself into it. Y’all..... if it was $60, I would buy it and use it.. it is what is it. THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!! Trust me! I should have listened to myself before buying this junk. But I’ll list pros/cons:Cons—1. My house has been vacuumed and mopped, right? (Actually vacuumed twice Bc I vacuumed it with my dyson first). Shouldn’t it smell clean?! I just “mopped” my floors, but my house doesn’t smell any fresher.2. These rollers that hair doesn’t get stuck on.. well hair gets stuck all up in it!3. I want my house to smell clean, but the bissell cleaner doesn’t have a nice, noticeable clean smell, it’s just subtle and like mopping with water.4. This is what really Erked me— I couldn’t get close to my baseboards! At all. I left close to about an inch by my baseboards Bc it wouldn’t mop it..5. Have you ever vacuumed in reverse!? If not, get ready to! You’ll be running all over your cords!!Typically with a cord, I’m moving away from where it’s plugged in at. Leaving the excess cord behind me. With this, I’m having to work my way towards my cords so I’m not walking in my wet floor and tracking it up with foot printsPros—1. Ppl complained about the water it left behind, but that didn’t necessarily bother me. It just “mopped” so I expect it to be wet.That’s about all I got! I will be returning this! Because it’s definitely not worth the money. I was actually pretty disappointed....",
Laura,5.0 out of 5 stars,So Many Things to Like About This Machine,the United States,16-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Yes! A floor cleaning machine that understands how important it is to be able to keep the machine from clogging and losing suction! The dirty water cup has two filters to trap hair and other debris. It's easy to take apart and you can even remove the cleaning head and roller for a thorough cleaning. Someone was also smart enough to realize that if you can put it in a shallow pan with a few inches of clean water, you can suck that water up and clean the inside of the machine as well. Brilliant.It sprays out just the right amount of cleaning fluid which means it doesn't leave puddles of water behind as it cleans. It's easy to use. If I was a teacher, I'd give this machine a ""B"". It's good, but,  I would be happier with just a little more suction.One last thing. Bissell claims that the Pet Pro picks up chunky things, and maybe it does, a few times, but, I wouldn't do that to any machine on a regular basis and I would certainly clean the parts and filter thoroughly afterwards. If you want any floor cleaning machine to last longer, vacuum your floors first! Don't be lazy.So far, it's probably the best buy at this price point for a hard surface floor cleaner. Go ahead. Buy it.",One
Brandizzle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a vacuum replacement, but works great on hard floors.",the United States,28-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I cannot recommend the Bissell Crosswave enough! I highly recommend it for tile and hardwood. It has replaced mopping for me, as it’s so much easier.  You can also use it on rugs, but it is really great on hard floors. I tried it on my rugs, but I’ll just stick with my regular vacuum for carpet and such. It is easy to use and easy to clean. After “mopping” with the Crosswave, I just pull out the strainer with the hair and solids and dump in the trash. The dirty water then goes down the toilet. Next, I return the canister and run the machine on the self clean cycle. This cleans the brush and any dirt that may be left in the machine. Empty the water from the canister and you’re good to go for next time. I let the clean brush and filter air dry and then put it back in before I use it the next time. I use the machine to mop about every other day and my floors have never felt cleaner. I wish it cleaned grout, but I’m afraid that is going to have to be done with manual scrubbing.",One
eseta,2.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,the United States,1-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I honestly have to say I'm a little disappointed with this purchase.  I wish I would've saved my money and bought something else. I bought is since I have 2 dogs (mini blue heeler and mix lab) I vacuum everyday and thought by buying this it will be less work for me. But I was wrong. I used it to clean my area rug, I won't lie it did get a lot of the dirt out of the rug but I have to fill it up 3 to 4 times and dump the water. I also had to remove dog hair near the brush part since it was getting clogged (my mini blue heeler doesn't shed that bad since I deshed her) I tried it on my tile floors not impressed as I had to mop over it and feel like it hardly cleaned it. Cleaning the machine is a pain in the butt in my opinion. I thought the petpro will be for pets but I guess it would work better if you had a hairless cat or something like that.",One
scott watkins,4.0 out of 5 stars,Will buy again and again,the United States,12-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Unbiased. Unsponsered review. Mother of 5 in/outdoor kids, Of 3 - 4 legged furr babies, and of 1-4 legged purr baby.Like/Pro: Super easy to assemble.  So easy my 12 year old did it.  Came with x 2 solutions (about 3 large areas ""700 Sq ft per large area"".) Came with 2 rollers. Came with cleaning station.  GREAT suction.  Even if it can't reach to scrubs it (very near baseboards and along base of kitchen cabinets) It does suck MOST debris including pet hair without hesitation.  You may have to make a couple passes on rug mode for hard floors to get extra gunny stuff up, but 90% of the time it does seem to get it. Swivel gets under and in-between most furniture without difficulty. It doesn't use up solution like other machines I've used, but it uses a good amount for continuous application.  Rollers are mostly soft and nonscuffing for all the floors. Cord is nice and long.Cons/dislike: Poor handle layout.  When I push the trigger to dispense solution, I often either turn it off or switch modes mid clean...very frustrating. It will not abut cabinets, appliances, or baseboards.  It is also is not usable on hard floor stairs especially if they have a bull nose.  Be prepared for a full clean you will have to come up with another idea to get these spaces. The cleaner for Bissell leaves a film on ceramic tile, sheet laminate, and wood floors.  You will have to periodically clean them with a buffer of some sort to remove the film.  The filter gets dirty FAST.  Clearly its working but I'm concerned about the longevity of it.  The plastic filter in the dirty water tank is a nice not really functional, I didn't notice it catching much at all.  Finally, I'm not in love with the roller.  It gets VERY dirty, especially in our house, with the sheer foot traffic.  Then you are using a dirty roller on all the floors...Which kind of defeats the purpose of ""never using dirty water again"".Overall, we have about 2600 sq ft of wood, and 300 square ft remaining of tile and 100 square ft of sheet laminate (UGHH). our brand new floors are going to be in great hands.  Wait for the videos and pics of it hard at work!!!  It only took about 25 minutes to do my entire upstairs! It used to take over and hour plus dry time to sweep/vacuum, mop, and let our world dry!!

Rey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,8-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this machine. If you are doing research, here is a straight to the point pro/con list.Pros:It really does cleanNot hard to pushEasy to cleanDoes not reuse dirty water like a mop and bucket.Beats the mop cardio workout.Cons:Does not fit in smaller spaces so you still need to mop on those spaces.Does not include attachments to do the job in the smaller spaces.Does not turn like the Dyson vacuum. Angles are a challenge.Does not go flat. So not good for under beds or dressers. Unlike the dyson that goes completely flat and I can reach all those places.The tank, while it looks large for the dirty water, it tells you it’s full when it is half way. If you look at the pictures, the full mark like is midway through the tank (waste for me).The solution is pricey. And if you are planning to use it for tile and rugs, I’d warn the solution is different for each so you will have to switch solutions.Comes with only one filter. I wish it brought a filter per roll.Cheaper at Costco (saw it after I bought this one).Even with the cons it is so much better than mopping. Still worth the money.",

Hey, it picked it up from your floor!!! I have used it about five times with very good results. It's lightweight, easy to manuever, and does what it's made for. Others complained about after time it stopped sucking up water (maybe poor maintainence.) I've used several different floor cleaning machines and this one is probably the best all around.

I have 2 kids, a dog, and a husband who gave this to me for my 36th birthday (woo hoo... right?)  This might be the best gift I've ever requested and received.  It vacuums.  It mops.  It gets out stains in my carpet from my pets.  The suction on this is unbelievable.  Most men would be envious of the vacuum over their woman, but we all know men don't vacuum so they don't know what they are missing.

I'd show a picture of the nastiness it got off of my floors, but that would be embarrassing, possibly more so than my suction comments.The ONLY negative to me was if you are on slick tile floor and constantly use the mop feature, the wheels do slide around a bit.  To offset that, it is awesome that you can simply run over the floor on vacuum only to dry it right up.If you are debating... get one.",One
ClassyLady7,5.0 out of 5 stars,All the hype is true,the United States,2-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I watched the infomercials and the Youtube videos saying all the pros and cons about this floor cleaner machine, I was still a little skeptical but wow, it is impressive.  I was both amazed and a little ashamed at the dirt it brought up off my all-hard floors.  Beautiful job.  I love this machine.  It's not that loud and the cleaning job is amazing.  The large area tank fill cleaned most of my house, it goes further than the 700sqft claim in my opinion.  I used the Rug button once for a sticky spill but one pass up and back cleaned everything else. I did make a couple passes without formula because I wanted my floors dry as possible but it doesn't really leave them wet.  The only con I could find is that the brush itself does not make contact all the way across the path of the cleaner. There's a bit of framework on either side of the brush so it does not clean the sides.  I just made sure that I approached the walls and edges front-on instead of from the sides.  I am very happy with this, one of the best things I've bought in recent memory.  KLF",One
Pierre,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep cleaning with less effort and time,the United States,22-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"More than 1500 sq ft of hard floors plus a dog that tracks in outdoor life and sheds and no one to clean the house but me. The old method - vacuuming each room, then mopping each room, filling and emptying the bucket of water multiple times, waiting too long for floors to dry - HOURS! The Crosswave Pet Pro arrived and I have the cleanest floors I've ever had WITHOUT QUESTION. It takes about five minutes of usage to figure out how to spray the right amount of cleaning solution, how fast to go, how to maneuver around things, but then you're a pro and even with slower strokes back and forth, the whole house is complete in less than half the time. Unfortunately, the machine can't get into tight spots, so the last half inch by the wall, corners, and behind toilets will require manual handling. And the clean and dirty water tanks might be fine for a room or two, but I had to empty dirty water and refill cleaning solution 5-6 times to get the whole house done. With all of that, I still spent less than half the time to get the cleanest floors I've ever had. Buy it.",
Bendrix,3.0 out of 5 stars,Better for smaller homes or apartments.,the United States,3-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I actually like this product, but I had to return it for these reasons:Number one: it’s small. The brush head is only a foot long and if you’re going to be doing more than one room it may take a while. This will be perfect for a smaller homes or apartments.Number two:  this works best on flat, even surfaces. I have slate flooring upstairs and the water distribution was spotty at best. It required multiple times covering the same area in order to get enough water on the floor.  It worked great in my bathrooms where the tile smooth and flat.  This will probably help keep your grout clean as well!Number three: it’s kind of plasticky.  Kind of feels like a toy in some respects. But I am 6‘2“ tall so most things do to me.Other than that, I really did enjoy the product. My floors were clean and it did suck up any excess water. I used the rug option and it did clean a dirty spot on my rug. If this came in a larger more powerful size I would buy it in a heartbeat!",
Danni,3.0 out of 5 stars,Eh.... mixed feelings,the United States,10-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"At first I was really excited about this because of its versatility with wet and dry carpet and hardwood. But this thing is cumbersome and a pain to clean. I have one long haired dog who sheds a lot (Shepherd) and two adults living in this house. When using the actual wet vac it’s tends to get a lot of dirt up out of the carpets which is great. Cleaning this device takes more time than actually vacuuming. Possibly because it sucks up a lot of dirt and also because the canister is so small it need to be emptied often, especially when dry vacuuming. Even when the canister is not full I’ll often have to stop and clean out some of the debris before continuing because it will create little fur and dirt worms. It doesn’t come with attachments so if you need to clean say a dog bed or a couch etc you would need to get something  else. I do like that you can move between carpet and hardwood easily (the buttons are on the handle) and it does seem to have good suction.",3
Tracy Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cat Hair Magnet,the United States,20-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Two shedding cats, house has all tile floors, a couple of area rugs.  Old process: Sweep or dust mop daily. Add vacuum after that, then mop weekly.  Crosswave was supposed to arrive 4 days after I had swept, vacuumed and mopped.  It showed up in 2 days.  I did not use the cleaning solution provided as my ""tile guy"" has a different product he recommends to preserve the recent restore job.  I put it together (easy) and took it for a spin.  I had already swept that day and it's only two days since I swept, vacuumed and mopped.  It was enlightening and horrifying at the same time.  When I took the dirty water container out to empty, I had trouble and had to re-consult the directions as i couldn't find the filter.  It was literally buried in soggy cat hair with a layer of fine Arizona sand silt at the bottom!  I also had a lot of streaks.  I tried it again a few days later, it was early and a lot of slanted sunlight was coming in the windows.  I noticed I had streaks in some places but not in others.  I figured out you have to work at the Crosswave's pace, you can't rush it.  Don't get ahead of the squirt, don't pull back fast to suck it up.  Moving at a measured pace is key.  The swivel lets me in under and around more of the furniture, so there's less I have to move.  I had a lot less hair and silt in the dirty water but still a significant amount.  The clean up afterwards is rather involved as others have noted but given the amount of time it took to go over the floors to sweep, then vacuum, then mop plus pushing around furniture, overall it's faster and it's a better job.  I have a covered patio which is where I do the cleanup and leave everything to dry.  If I get to it early, everything is dry by the end of the day.  This thing is a keeper.",
Linda K. Rudd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Changed the way I clean house.,the United States,6-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this 8 months ago and have waited to review it to see if it was worth the money I paid.  The Crosswave pet pro has saved me from hours of hard work.9 months ago my husband passed away. He was the one who always mopped out tile floors.  1226 sq.  I did the floors one time after he passed and then began looking for a better way.I had no help around my house after his passing. We never had children, but we had our sweet loving little dogs.One late night I saw an infomercial for the Crosswave.  The next day I went online to the Bissel website but before I placed the order I did what I always do.  Checked Amazon.Two days later it arrived.  I let it sit for a couple of days then took a close look at my floors.  I had to do something.  I opened the box, then opened the actual box that the Crosswave comes in.  I first  pulled out the instructions. Seemed simple enough.  It was simple!  and before I knew it I was cleaning my floors with the Crosswave. It was light weight, easy to maneuver, and wow what a job it did. This is easier than vacuuming.  I could not believe what mopping with a conventional mop had left on my floors.  The Crosswave returned my floors to the original color. I just hadn't realized how dirty they really were. We mopped once a week. How could it still be dirty?I have a bad knee and lower back problems. The Crosswave has really saved me.I clean my Crosswave every time I use it and it is even easy to clean. I know I sound like an infomercial but it has been worth every penny.  Maybe in a year I will review again and let everyone know how it's going.But for now...Thank you Bissel for such a great product.",2
Lisa S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have,the United States,4-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is the best all in one that I have used. The suction on the rugs are so strong it really lifts all dirt, stains and dog pee. I bought this because my moms dog sometimes has accidents in the house, we have 3 boys and a boxer who is very city and slobbery dog. I have light floors, white cabinets and my house shows dirt. This vac is a lifesaver.1. It washes, dries and vacuums2. It maneuvering around things and under stuff is wonderful and I can get into the hard to reach spots.3. No more having to wait for floors to dry.4. No more washing money on throw away wet pads5. It disinfects my floors from the dogs6. The stub brushes get the tough stains outI can go on and on. For the streaking problems, there are none if you go slow after washing the floor. I use the rug setting on everything because it dries the floors better. I have no streaking problems at all.

allta sebac,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,20-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I am 70 years old, I live on a Florida sand 'hill', have tile floors and have 4 dogs and a cat. I was interested in this product, but the price was a little steep on a fixed income. The day I rescued my 4th dog I was sitting in living room with my 4 babies and an advertisement for this came on the TV. I sat watching that, looking a my dogs and my sandy floors. To clean my floors I would have to sweep, vacuum and mop then wait them to dry, dogs never could learn don't walk on wet floors. I decided to go to Amazon and buy one. Best thing ever.In the time it takes to just vacuum my floors the whole job is done. No buckets of water,  picks up all reasonably sized pieces, dropped kibble etc, dog hair and in my case tons of sand. Suction feature also ensures floor to dry quickly and there are no wet mops and heavy buckets of dirty water clean up and the whole house smells fresh.I would recommend this product to anyone, even those with our pets, but ESPECIALLY those with pets.",3
Crystal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spits dirty water out,the United States,22-Oct-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I received the product a few days ago. I’ve used it a few times trying to decide if I life it or not. The first time I used it, I kept hitting the on and off button located on the handle and shutting it off while trying to clean. Really annoying, but I finally got use to the buttons being there.A couple nights ago my dog had an accident on the tile in the middle of the night, irritated about the accident but excited to use the cleaner because this is the real reason I bought the machine... for accidents made by children and pets!!! As I used the cleaner, I noticed my legs were getting splashed, but I didn’t think much of it.Last night my son was taking a bath and he got more water on the floor than in the tub, so I decided his bathroom was due for a cleaning. I gladly grabbed my new floor cleaner and started cleaning. As I cleaned the floor, my legs were getting splashed, I then realized it was the dirty water coming through the vents on the side of the machine. Cleaned the floors very well, but I needed a shower after.The strainer in the dirty water bin is a great idea, however, it’s not perfect, I get a lot more debris in the water than I do the strainer. It works great for large amounts of pet hair though!My favorite part of the product is the base plate you put the machine on that self cleans.Overall, I’m not sure how happy I am with this product. I may return it and try another brand, but I’m still giving it a chance.",6
CydLHH,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dirty Streaks everywhere,the United States,16-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I wasn't sure when the BISSELL Crosswave Pet Pro would arrive. So I vacuumed as usual. The next day (today), here it is! Light but sturdy and very easy to put together (handle, seriously). Good instructions, both attached to the handle and the manual because people, how many of us read every page of the manual?I live in Phoenix, desert dust. I bought the Bissell because I didn't have a carpet cleaner. The floor rugs were a bit gray. I assumed the hardwood was fine. Remember, I had vacuumed. Just look at the picture. I hate sharing that, I am a clean person. But this small house had a baseball size wad of WTH and I didn't know it. That is a solid wad of ""I really don't want to know more"" wad. I know your next question. I have one small indoor cat. ONE. And I vacuum often.Now here is the unacceptable downside. While I love that this picks up hair when other vacuums don't, the wet use of this vacuum is terrible. I have to rinse and clean the roller every few minutes. No matter how often I use this. All it takes is a tiny spot of dirt and it smears it all over the floor area. So then I am trying to clean what I have just cleaned. Every time. And my floors feel dirty just looking at the tile areas because I can only assume the carpets have that dirty water in them, too. I wonder if a different roller option would work but honestly, Bissell, at $300, you should have nailed this. For now, I use this occasionally to pick up the excess hair and then grab another cleaner to clean after this machine.",
Samantha Stinson,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love it but not what I hoped,the United States,28-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So first of all, I think the idea behind this is great so I wanted to love it.  However, there were several things that were disappointing.  First, the suction power is sad... it barely picks up things off the ground.  At the very least, it should be able to suck water off the floor.  It does not really do even that well.  Secondly, the damn thing is supposed to lock upright so you can roll it.  Unfortunately for me I have some slightly deeper than normal grout lines which apparently disturb the mechanism enough that it constantly falls and I frequently must lock it back into place.  It’s super frustrating.  Third, it’s hard to push on carpet.  On a positive note, I have a great upper body workout when I’m done cleaning the area rug. Finally, it just feels like a kid’s toy.  I know it is a bissell but for the price, I had hoped for a little heavier duty situation.  If I drop it while vacuuming (things happen), I wouldn’t be surprised if something cracked and it would become unusable.  As for positives, it does seem to clean although I’m not sure how well it is getting in the grout lines.  Definitely should vacuum an area rug or carpet before using because as mentioned, the suction is not where it’s at.  It does seem to freshen it up.  I’ve been using the provided cleaner and it has an interesting scent.  Not sure if I love it or hate it but it’s ok.  I love that you can clean it up easily.  And don’t be like me and leave the dirty water in there thinking you’ll be using it the next day... because you won’t and then you will have to clean out some sewage smelling mess.  TRUST ME ON THIS!  Overall it’s ok.  I like the idea of having a clean mop head when I do floors so that is definitely a positive but I’m not sure it was worth the money.",
Jose,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not too bad.,the United States,12-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Don't buy extra solution unless you need too.  This item comes with 2 8oz multi surface pet solution and two microfiber rolls.  This item cleans well after learning how slow paced you have to use this machine.  The only downside is it is hard to maneuver under tight areas,  the lower you go, the brush will lift off of the surface.",3
Daniel Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,the United States,17-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I truly love this machine. It is lightweight, but, sturdy, hardworking, yet elegant. I like how easy it is to keep clean, the roller comes out so you can rinse the main opening of any hair. I also love that it vacuums at the same time as cleaning. It's nice to grab it and vacuum up some crumbs without going through the whole wet process. I pretty much use it every day. just grab it and hit one room at a time.",11
Olivia Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,The absolute best,the United States,7-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’ve been through many many vacuums with a Labrador and a golden, the shedding is just, well everywhere. Regular vacuums like my shark is wonderful but I started noticing emptying it out I could never fully get everything in the trash bin and some specs of dust or fur was left on the ground making the tile feel gritty. Now this vacuum uses like the old fashioned rainbow vacuums almost and all that dirt and fur gets trapped in the water making your floors feel amazing! I also love that it cleans the grout. I’m too busy to be able to hands and knees mop my floor, so this does wonders best purchase I’ve ever made makes me want to throw out my dyson animal!For note all the vacuums I have and this one beats them all:- dyson animal - might be the worst one, it’s been downgraded to a quick vacuum type of vacuum since it’s cordless- roomba i7  with emptying base - just awful for us. Every part has been replaced on it and the hair has caused it to smoke several times, thank goodness I was home. Only warranty parts were replaced for this one. The worst one in my line up and terrified to use it so that was a waste of money.- Shark navigator - the best for my carpet/rug areas, which is a small portion of the house but needed and it’s okay for tile but doesnt beat this Bissell.TLDR; this is the best vacuum I’ve had for tile",
Marie C,2.0 out of 5 stars,Will be sending it back,the United States,12-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Ok so I HOPE the one I received is just defective because I really want to love this product. I’m sending this one back & will order a new one once it becomes available.The first time I used my early Christmas gift, it started working beautifully just as expected. Then after finishing maybe 2 bedrooms, the noise changed & it started spitting out dirty soapy water. As if the dirty water tank and the soap tank were both being sprayed onto the floor. This happened while I had the soap button disengaged, so in theory only the brush and vacuum feature should be working. I ended up having to use my old school mop because I couldn’t fix it.Pros: it did a great job cleaning up a little dog pee accident I didn’t notice before. Scrubbed the grout great. It uses very little water for large areas.Cons: it doesn’t fit in tight spaces like a mop would. So you will need to mop the areas it can’t reach.It also doesn’t clean close to the baseboard. I saw at least an inch if not more of dry area that it couldn’t clean.All in all, I’ll give this another try but it’s not as fantastic as I was hoping it would be. For now anyway.",
Sonni2517,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a deep cleaner but very useful between deep cleans.,the United States,29-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love how light and easy it is to use it. I like the two separate water tanks. I don’t like that I need to clean it after each use, but I understand that is necessary to preserve the life of the machine, and prevent cleaning with a dirty appliance. I wouldn’t consider this a deep cleaner. If you have dirty tile or grout, it will require a good scrub with a brush and some deep cleaning solution first. This is great between those cleanings, but don’t expect miracles. This saves me time and effort from mopping. I still have to vacuum and deep clean between uses. This is a tool just like everything else.",One
DL,1.0 out of 5 stars,Onky 1 star for the customer service rep not the product,the United States,31-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So I got the first one, damaged, got second one afew months in stops working for the mopping liquid function. I contacted Bissell who advised. Me to take a paperclip and poke it in sprayer nozzles. When that did not fix they had me cut off cord and send cord back throw out main body. They ship me another.. Two weeks in the spring and screen on the solution bottle comes off as it was barely glued at edges. Had issues with it leaking when you went to put bottle back. Then a cpue months same issues with sprayer bottle. At this point I have bought new brushes a d filter and try to clean and get it working. It works partly and if I spray or poutlr liquid it will sort of suck it up from carpet not floor. Well the last straw was that the thing will not Eve. Pick up dirt on a. Ompletd dry vacuum. So to the trash it goes. Nothing but frustration a d trying to repair and limp it along. I hardly used it and when my big regular vacuum stopped working. I thought well at least I can use the vacuum part.all it did was push stuff around the floor. Alot of wasted money and time.",

Floors or rugs- cleans well. Fits under my dinning room chairs with ease. Even my husband can use it! If i had one complaint it’s that it’s difficult to clean. Especially the bottom parts.

P. Callahan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding wet/dry vac,the United States,26-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"All in all, I am very pleased with this product.  That said, I have to remove a star for a couple of design flaws.  The on/off switches are a bit too close to where my hand needs to go, so I found myself shutting the machine down by accident fairly regularly.  The cord wraps around the solution hopper, which is awkward, and the cord comes loose from its holder on the handle way too often.  But oh my gosh, can this thing clean a floor!  We have hardwood, slate and travertine floors, and this thing cuts through the crevices and joints like nothing else I’ve ever experienced.  My floors have never been so clean.  And that’s really saying something because our cats have an ongoing pee war.  For the first time in years, there is not even the slightest whiff of cat pee.  The self-cleaning roller is brilliant.  If you can reach $300 deep for a household wet/dry vac, this is the one you want.",
Dawn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beats cleaning on hands and knees,the United States,26-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If your looking for a miracle machine that will scrub gunk and build up off your floors and make your grout like new again this is not it, however, if your realistic and looking for a machine that is easy to use, vacuums before mopping, eliminates getting on your hands and knees to mop, and uses clean water with detergent to clean your floors then this is it. It does a good job on maintaining a cleaner floor, and the more it was used the cleaner my grout did get. I purchased the crosswave pet pro in March, I have 2 cats and a husband, I used it daily for about a week and then my schedule amped up and I was super busy.  And now i use it on average about every 3 days sometimes more so in the kitchen after cooking, and it still works like the day I received it. before I purchased it I read reviews  so I was aware of what to expected when I received the machine.  I took the time before it arrived to thoroughly clean my floors with a mop, scrub brush on my hands and knees etc. to start with a clean surface and see how well it maintained keeping my floors clean before having to do the deep clean on hands and knees again, because let’s face it it’s a $250 ish mop it isn’t going to clean like a professional $3000 and up floor cleaner is going to do. Well it’s almost June and I have yet to deep clean on my hands and knees. It has done a wonderful job maintaining my floors as long as I use it on a regular basis. The vacuum part is great for pet hair, dust, dirt and litter, however once you start using the water/solution the area that sucks up the water clogs if you come into contact with kitty litter so you’ll have to clean it off and it’s super easy I just use a wet towel and it wipes off but can be a bit inconvenient so I make sure I use my whole house vacuum cleaner in the kitty litter areas before I am going to vac/mop there.It also does a great job on area rugs, But I mostly use it on my porous tiles floors. And I clean the machine each time I use it for my whole house and it doesn’t take that much time to do so and it’ll help keep it working longer so I hope. A little advice if you purchase one keep the machine clean, buy extra hepa filters when you purchase the crosswave I did (3) and I’m so glad I did, if you use it for a half to whole house you will use the extra hepa filters, They are easy to clean just rinse and set in the sun to dry. Also never use a cleaning product that is sudsy or foamy with this, it will effect the motor/lock it up.I only gave 4 stars because I do think it’s a bit overpriced for what you get, hard plastic that may or may not crack you just don’t know but you know it’s going to happen, the suction is good but the slot is small and thin and will clog with kitty litter, grimy gunk, etc, and the squeegee could be a bit larger. But if your like me and want clean floors in your home on a daily basis this is worth it. And one day when this one stops working I will buy another one. Just makes mopping a bit simpler and keeps our allergies at bay as well.",One
Jeffrey E. Starkey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, almost didn't buy it because of a few reviews but so glad that I did!",the United States,20-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is an awesome product. Some of the reviews made me look around a little more but I came back to this one. When it arrived, I had just mopped the floor a day or two before then ran this thing over it and the water was filthy. Obviously the mopping does not pick it all up very well even though it helps. I waited 3 days and did the kitchen again and the water was filthy again. It is so much easier to use then a mop bucket and you don't have to vacuum it all first. My wife says that it hurts her back to do so much mopping but this is the same as vacuuming so now she is not dreading cleaning the floor. My entire downstairs is tile (about 1200 sq ft) so it takes two fill ups to clean it all but I am more liberal with applying solution then is needed. Emptying the canister is not that big of a deal but being a neat freak, it's a little bit of a dirty job. I wish I could post a video of it because 9 out of 10 would say that it's no big deal. I pull all of the parts out of the canister in the sink and then pour the water in the toilet. Then I rinse it all off in the sink, assemble and continue on. It's all so worth it based on not only the amount of dirt it picks up, but also, the only time my floor has been so clean that it feels good on my bare feet is after the carpet cleaning company does a high pressure steam blast cleaning to it. That's $500 a pop with how much tile I have, but this product will help to keep it clean after they do their thing so maybe I can go longer in between the pressure steam clean jobs. I would not hesitate to recommend that you buy this. As long as it lasts, it will be one of my favorite products in the house.",One
Haylee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use, works great!",the United States,8-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I really like this thing!  I sure wish I had bought it years ago instead of the 3 mops and steam cleaner I have in my utility closet that don't do as good a job and are much more laborious to use.  I have off white tile floors which have a kind of matte texture so everything sticks and won't come up with a mop or even my steam cleaner.  The only way to get my floors clean is to scrub them the old fashioned way on your hands and knees with bucket and a brush.  I'm not going to do that and I am so tired of changing out dirty mop bucket water, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Cleaning my 2400 square feet of tile with the spin mop takes me hours and hours, wears blisters on my hand and hurts my back.  I did it with this machine in probably 1/4 the time.  I did have to empty the dirty water tank and fill the water and solution tank probably 15 times but the machine is very easy to use so it wasn't a big deal.  I wasn't sure how the area rug feature would work but I love it!  It gets the rug damp enough to get the top layer of dust and pet hair off which really brightens up the color and nap.  I gave it 3 stars for deep cleaning because as other reviewers said, it isn't for deep cleaning but it sure is good and easy for every day or every week cleaning!  I love it and highly recommend it.",
CandaceVan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At this time, my advice is: Do Not Purchase This Product",the United States,4-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro All-in-One Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner from Amazon.com on Dec. 28, 2018. I used it once and it worked great. The second time I went to use it, it wouldn't work at all. I contacted Bissell and was referred to an authorized service center. They've had it since the latter part of January 2019. I called today (6/4/19). They said they couldn't repair it (or any Bissell machines) because Bissell was not responding to their calls or contacts due to some kind of corporate restructuring. They suggested I contact Bissell directly. I tried Bissell's chat feature and got a ""volume of contacts too high, try again later message. Now I've sent them an email. Five months for a warranty repair is absurd. Having to get a warranty repair after one use is ridiculous. As pleased as I have been in the past with Bissell products, I do not recommend buying this or any other Bissell product at this time. At least hold off until Bissell regains the ability to work with their authorized repair centers to get work done or until they make it less onerous for a consumer to contact them. I paid close to $300 for this machine, and for one use? It's definitely not worth it. A product is only as good as the company that stands behind it. It would appear that currently, Bissell simply does not support their products OR their authorized repair centers.",One
Jenny 8675309,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,5-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for the daily clean up,  not the deep clean. Even for that intended purpose im disappointed.  When dispensing the cleaner it does so leaving two lines running up and down my floor. Even after going over it again, still just two wet lines. I can run the machine 3xs over the same spot (cleaning the brush invetween) and still wipe up dirty water. Once you are done dispensing the water youre supposed to cover the area again to remove the dirty water, but it does that poorly as well leaving the floor considerably wet. The area rug function is useless. It doesnt get even the smallest surface sports up, doesnt get even a small fraction of the water up and leaves you with a rug wet with dirty water. Once you've repeatedly gone over your floor to even make it evenly clean, then to clean and dry everything throughly you're better off to wash or the price i paid and the reputation Bissell has, i am sorely disappointed. Will be reselling the item as im outside my return window and looking into more efficacious alternatives.",
Christopher Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed on first use,the United States,12-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"OK, a voice of experience here! I have owned three Hoover machines including two floor mates and a Karcher machine. The Bissell is a very well made machine in comparison with the others. The Hoover floor mates as noted by other users do not have the longevity, they generally last about a year before the motor goes out. The first Karcher machine had a gearbox problem after only a few months, the manufacturer did honor their warranty and replaced the machine only to have that one quit at the warranty limit, the cleaning solution dispensing tubing became clogged and I was unable to repair, yet another machine took a trip to the dump!!!OK, so back to the Bissell, I like the controls, no more switching between clean and dry as on the Hoover, nice long power cord so not too much outlet switching. Nice clear marking of the amount of water and solution that you need to use. Motor noise isn’t too bad, quieter than the Hoover. Easy to maneuver, not too heavy.Very impressed with the suction, I have always been disappointed with the disparity between the amount of fluid that goes onto the floor and the amount that gets picked up! This one did a much better job than any of the others. Really like the design of the waste tank, especially the hair strainer, makes cleanup easier. Regarding the negative comments about streaks, I see these whilst the floor is still wet but they disappear when dry, BTW I used this on ceramic tile and sealed hardwood.My only criticism is that it did not quite get the edges. Just purchased this in September 2021, I will post a follow up as time goes on, let’s see how long this machine lasts!",
Judy MacKenzee,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is not going to replace your vacuum but does do a good job on the hard floors.,the United States,15-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this item thinking it could be  used as both a vacuum and floor cleaner, therefore replacing my vacuum, this was not the case. I am disappointed that for the cost of this cleaner it doesn’t double as both but if I’d gone into it for strictly being a floor cleaner I would be satisfied because it does do a good job with the floor cleaning part. The only bad thing I would say about the unit is the time involved in cleaning everything between and during use takes a bit of time and the unit needs to be emptied often. My house is only 1900 sq ft and to clean it all I’d have to empty and refill 2-3x. You will go thru a lot of cleaning solution as well and it’s not cheap so that adds up. In the end I would say I am satisfied with the cleanliness it produces but to do it again I would purchase a cheaper unit because for the cost it’s not worth it, especially considering you need to still have a vacuum cleaner.  One last note to add is that this does not do a good job cleaning carpets - if you have carpet in the majority of your house buy a carpet cleaner not this - it’s only worth it if you have majority hard floors in your house to clean. If you only have a kitchen and bathrooms not carpeted don’t waste your money a cheaper floor cleaner will do the job this won’t save you time unless your cleaning an entire house.",
Scott Turner,4.0 out of 5 stars,A very good machine for what it is,the United States,19-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I got this delivered today, and wasted no time putting it to use. Assembly was easy, a snap and a click and you are done. It works the same way as most floor cleaners do, a bottle for clean water/chemical and a waste bottle.A few things struck me straight away. The cord is of ample length for all but the largest of rooms, the machine is light, and easy to maneuver. On the handle are two buttons that select the type of cleaning (hard floor or carpet) and double as the power switch. In the handle is a trigger to dispense water/chemical.Our house is all tile, and gets dirty very quickly. After cleaning the floor with this machine, it looks much better and is noticeably cleaner. I wish the machine would dispense and retrieve more  water/chemical, but that's not quite what this is designed for. Overall, the machine did a very good job at picking up the dog fur and dirt on the floor. The floor dried quickly also, a bonus.Cleaning the machine is easy, it comes apart as easily as it goes together. The dirt the filters trapped was impressive. The machine also comes with what is essentially a drip tray that it sits on when not in use, a nice feature.",
MomOf7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfectly!,the United States,10-Feb-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I waited to review till I've used many times. Probably would have helped me to read the instructions, but I figured it out. Lost a filter to mildew, though, because I got it wet rinsing the dirty water reservoir. That aside, I got a new filter and take it out to rinse the unit, and it works perfectly.I have 6 kids. And a farm. There is ALWAYS dirt. I have cleaned up spit up, vomit, poop, pee, wet noodles and rice, chia seeds, cereal, milk... you name it. It works efficiently and easily! I love it! Hubby installs flooring for a living, and was sceptical at first, and he's impressed too. He was thinking we would have to send it back, but took one look at the floors after I used it and changed his mind.",3
Mary Moon,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS BISSELL CROSSWAVE PET PRO,the United States,7-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is the worse product I’ve ever bought!  I have two dogs, I live in FL, so as anyone that has ever been here, they know sand gets everywhere. Also the dirt here is like dust, so when you mix the two, it’s a mess. So I bought this Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro thinking it worked as seen on t.v. It does NOT.  All this Bissell does is move the now wet dirt & sand around on the floor.  I need to return this.  Between deaths in my family and now the virus, I’ve missed the date in which I could return it.  It’s useless to me & I feel like I’m stuck with a useless gadget that was falsely advertised both on t.v. & Amazon.  I’m out over Two Hundred & Sixty Nine dollars & I have crap to show for it.  Don’t buy this item, it’s worthless",2
Samantha V,2.0 out of 5 stars,Complete let down. I didn't have the money for this and it was definitely a waste.,the United States,4-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Works well to vacuum but that's it. I clean it out THOROUGHLY after every use and it still smells like musty mop while using it. The spray of the formula comes out in streaks. When you park it to unplug or move rooms, etc. it leaves a small dirty puddle which then you need to RE vacuum over to clean it up.THE WORST PART is if you're anything like me and bought this particular one because you have dogs who shed, please noe you must vacuum, wash, then vacuum again because if any hair happens to be left, it will then end up wet and stuck on the floor so you have to re vacuum over it to suck up the hair. This means going over one place three times. It is definitely not at all what I thought it would be. I am very disappointed and really wish I hadn't purchased it.",One
sheryl/housewife,5.0 out of 5 stars,time saver,the United States,30-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"i love it, instead of dry mopping and then mopping i just get this out and it takes me a quarter of the time to get my floors done. i can actually do the whole house in less than 30 minutes.

Ed the critic,5.0 out of 5 stars,You might not need to buy new floors!,the United States,3-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"My wife is a cat lover and there have been times when two cats lived in our home.  Cats make a mess.  So we had ugly areas all over our house.  One of the feeding areas was especially bad.  Over the years, crusted wet cat food had built up.  The once-gray rug was crusted black.  We bought the supermarket rug cleaner and had poor results.  I was getting ready to pay for new floors when I learned about the Bissell Crosswave.  Since the machine arrived we have decide not to replace the floor covering.  It’s really nice not to live with all those ugly stains.  The machine works quite well.  It’s equally good on hard floors, or rugs.  If — like us — you have a house full of messy floors, I’d advise you to order the large bottle of floor cleaning solution.  It works well, but you need plenty",
Silver Toaster,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice little machine,the United States,26-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have a lot of tile in my house and have been wanting a vac/mop combo for a long time but hesitated on spending this much.  I received my machine last week.  Liked that it is small, light and easy to use, saves time, appears to be made fairly well in construction.  It is great for doing a ""mop and vac"" job weekly or even several times a week.  The down size is it doesn't seem to do quite of good of a job as an actual mop so really messy and deep cleaning should probably be done with an actual mop or scrub brush.  I wish the scrubber roll was more of a brush than a cotton roller.  Over all I am pleased with the machine and will use it often for light mop jobs.  It will save some serious time hauling around the vacuum cleaner first and then all the mop water changing mess.  I would purchase again.",One
Megan MacAlystre,5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite thing.,the United States,24-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is simply fantastic. We foster rescue dogs who can find the best mud puddles and are often not housebroken, so messes are common in our house. This does amazingly well with cleaning up mud and urine as well as any kitchen spills and general ""we live in the rural South and have a farm"" life. I love just being able to pull this out and clean up so quickly, including cleaning the rollers and dirty water container (thank you for the strainer!). The Pet multi-surface cleaner solution is really clean smelling, without being chemically or overwhelming, and this from people with allergies to a lot of scents!  I can't believe I'm about to write this, but this actually makes it fun to clean? The only drawback I can find is that one of our dogs wants to play with it when running, but this is true for any vacuum (she's not smart, poor thing). It held up fine to that before we locked her outside. LOL. She did manage to pull the brush cover off, but it snapped right back on.  What a timesaver!",
AZ Golfers,5.0 out of 5 stars,No more dirty mop water - love this Bissell,the United States,13-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Bought this after we moved to AZ with a very fluffy (read that as hairy) golden retriever.  After a few months of trying to mop our tile floors (and bucket after bucket of filthy water), decided to try this.  Where we live is very dusty and the dust is actually a little oily.  Big fluffy golden drags a ton of it in.  Love this Bissell!  I do use a Dyson vacuum on the hard floors first to remove the dog hair tumbleweeds, but this really cleans the tile well.  I was concerned when I read some of the reviews about streaks, but really no issues.  I only need to do a touch up in the corners where the vacuum head doesn't quite reach.  I just wish I could throw the mop heads into the wash.",One
CAlderman,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it,the United States,2-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Cleans my floors REALLY well. I wish I had bought it before now. I was amazed at how much dirt this machine picked up that the steam mop left behind. Suction is great. It isn’t 5 stars because of the strain on my hand and arm to operate. I have osteoarthritis and having to hold down the button the entire time I’m mopping puts a strain on my hand and arm.  It takes me two days to clean my one story house because of that. I still recommend this machine because of its exceptional cleaning power.,One
PJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Should Have Purchased This Years Ago!,the United States,18-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have 3900sf of stone and wood floors, and a rug beneath my office desk. If you have wood floors, you know what a pain it is to keep them clean and shiny! Ive used steam cleaners, mops of all different types, chamois cloths, and the disposable mop dealt boppers. This machine cleans without leaving streaks and the vacuum is awesome! It took a couple different cleaning sessions before the floor was spotless and the grout between the stones was clean. It cleaned the rug and even got up the ""chewie drool stain"" easily. We aren't dirty people, but we do have 2 heelers and a kitty cat that like to live inside at night!Even if the machine quits after a couple years, because let's face it, most machines don't last long anymore, I will replace it with another Bissell!",One
David,2.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely DO NOT recommend!!,the United States,22-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We purchased this in early February of 2019. I’ve seen a LOT of folks online asking about the Bissel Crosswave, saying they want one for Christmas, jokingly wanting to start a GoFundMe and I just wanted to give you all a fair warning- DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Seriously. I have the Crosswave PetPro and it is  soooo not worth almost $300. It leaves puddles of brown/grey water as you’re pushing it across the floor. Yes, I clean it after each use. One day after having it about 1 year, it stopped working so we had to find a YouTube tutorial, completely disassemble it and clean off some hair that had wrapped itself around the inside of the piece that makes the brush spin. It was a BIG pain to do. Is it a complete piece of junk? No. It is nice having a mop/broom in 1 appliance and it’s fairly compact. When I’m expecting company I run it over the floors really quick to get any hair/crumbs and it gets the job done. The mop brush is decent at scrubbing up spots in my kitchen and dining room. But... if I had it my way, I would pay maybe $50 for it. Not $288 which is what we paid. 😑Maybe I’m in the minority and other people love their BCW. That’s great. I just wanted to hop on here and give you something to think about before spending hard earned money on it.",
I'm in love with JESUS!,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW!!!,the United States,28-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Where do I start with this review?  First, if I could give it a 10 I would.  I’ve never been a spoiled person, only require my needs to be met, BUT this machine spoiled me!  It’s fantastic.  Can’t find a negative about it, or maybe one...my trigger finger for the wash fluid got tired.....NOT!  It vacuums, washes and damp dries all in one, how much easier could that be?  Also, using the large wash amount it cleaned 1,000 sq. Ft.  Glad it ran out, cause I then had an excuse to stop and have more fun another day.  I’m long gone on housecleaning, especially floors, but this beats ALL!  Now, Bissell make a small, LIGHTWEIGHT one for walls so I don’t have to scrub or repaint, I can just clean.  I don’t hand out compliments very easily on products but this one deserves 10 high 5’s !",One
Kimara Rex,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product for a pet owner, or anyone that has a dirty floor...",the United States,20-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Well the verdict is in, I highly recommend the Bissell Crosswave. I'm throwing my mop and bucket out for the trash. I'll tell you why I recommend this amazing product! I ran this in the hallway, dining room and kitchen....next is the bathroom. I can't freaking wait to attack that floor.I mainly purchased this because my dog leaves her drool marks all over the floor in the kitchen, it is a pain in the ass to mop up. You have to really scrub it up if it has dried and when the light shines through the windows, you can really notice it. This Crosswave invention is a saving grace. It acts as a dry vacuum too for that pesky pet hair. A couple passes over the floor and it is scrubbed off with the roller brush and the water doesn't sit on the floor either. The suction is so strong, the floor dries instantly. I'm  not going to lie, I was skeptical about purchasing this product due to the negative reviews but I didn't want that to hinder my decision,  I attached pictures to show you! I didn't sweep for a week to see just how much this works.  I give it a 10 out of 10⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",2
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hard Pass,the United States,25-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"There was so much hype about this thing and I was so excited to try it. I had high hopes but was very disappointed. Let me first say, it really isn’t saving you any time, you still must clean it after each use. For instance, your child drops an egg on the kitchen floor, you whip out your wave and it does in fact suck it all up. You still have to go over it with a paper towel and you will see it’s still yellow. Then you have to clean the entire system out or it will stink and the roller will smell like mildew. Anything like paper, wrappers, leafs, etc will be sucked up but will block suction and you have to stop and take it out. One of my biggest frustrations with it is that the roller doesn’t clean the entire length of the roller. It only cleans on two sides, not a full sweep. I will attach a photo to better explain this. If it were priced under $100 I’d say it may be worth it but at its current price point I would not repurchase or recommend.",
Moises A. Cordovi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Getting used to it,the United States,19-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I am very pleased with the way this vacuum cleaner works, simply put it dos the job.I had to use it a couple of times to get to know how to get great results. Its suction power is not as strong as a regular vacuum but slow pushing and pulling of the machine allows it to pick up the washing liquid and dry fast.Cleaning of the machine after its use is not so simple and fast but also it is not too hard.

Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,it is defective past the return date with amazon,the United States,2-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Every time I plug this machine into the outlet, it blows the ground-fault breakers. it worked fine for a for three months with being used approximately twice per week. In talking to Bissell, they want me to take my time and gasoline to drag this defective machine to their service center which I told them was unacceptable. I have been on hold for the available opinions to be checked. They are forcing me to go to the service center, telling me these machines are out of stock in their factory because this is their best seller. now they have found a machine that is in stock that they can replace this on with. They will send a call-tag to me and want me to cut off the cord and send it to them. When they receive the cord then they will send a new machine to me. After this hour long conversation, this is supposed to be backed up with an email, as I requested. I guess I'll see it this actually takes place. What a hassle.",3
Mala,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t bother.,the United States,23-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Okay, I was so excited about buying this vacuum. My cousin said it works great. No. Absolutely not. I have 6 dogs so I consistently have to sweep and clean my floors and this isn’t cutting it. Not to mention, I paid $299 for it instead of the $269 it’s offered in stores and here now.1. The suction is great BUT there is air blowing from somewhere so it blows the hair around causing double the work2. You are supposed to be able to sweep and mop at the same time. Nope. First day I received it, I tried to do both. Lol. Nope. The water just pushed the hair and dirt around. Now I have to vacuum the whole house and then come back and mop. Oh, and I don’t even use the mop part. (I’ll get to that in next point)3. I have white tile in my bathroom and don’t you even bother trying to use the mop. Water drips back from what I’m guessing is the spin brush and I have to clean twice as hard. It leave dirty brown water marks everywhere. I’ve reverted back to using my steam mop to clean the floors.4. LORD THE FILTER. this. Filter. Stinks. Ive tried vacuuming without the filter and it won’t work. Ive washed it in soap and water and it’s like it mildews. Then, the smell is blown throughout my house.5. Maybe I’m just used to my dyson (which I dearly miss) but the cord sucks. If you just absolutely don’t listen to my review and you buy this, opt for the cordless version if they have one.6. It’s hard to maneuver. It won’t go under furniture. It doesn’t turn well. It won’t suck anything next to the wall up unless you are fully facing it, which is hard to do in a hallway ugh. I have to sweep with a broom under furniture first and then vacuum it up.7. Why would you put a removable strainer that DOESNT lock into place in the dust/dirty water tank?I probably have more complaints but these are the main ones that bug me. I know it’s kind of harsh but I wish I would have known this. I’m not some crotchety old Karen lashing out at the world. I’m just a normal 28 year old, working throughout the week, not wanting to spend her entire weekend cleaning but doing it anyways because this vacuum is useless. Oh! And I would return it but that little removable strainer I told you about? Yeah, it’s gone. Someone in my house apparently didn’t realize it was there (because why tf would there be one) and it got thrown away with the dumped hair",One
Ms.luck,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money! Leave mass behind !!!,the United States,4-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Very disappointed in this all in one vacuum! I purchased mine back in 2018 because I have a dog and he would make masses and I thought oh what a great product this could save me so much time... wrong!!!! First let me say it leaves strikes and masses behind and suction is not great either fast forward to today it has lost all suction and power whatsoever and it’s not working so no do not spend your money! And by the way I haven’t used it regularly all over the house I would use it once in awhile in the kitchen probably if I had to count all together how many times I’ve used it I would say around 10 times or so and yes it’s that bad!,One
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Thought it was going to be better!,the United States,13-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I have the original crosswave and it has more suction than this pet version! The only difference between this and the original crosswave is there is a cheap plastic grate that is inside the dirty water tank that is supposed to catch pet hair. But the pet hair didnt make it that far and made the vaccum loose suction after about 10 feet of area and i had to clean it out! I used this item 6 different times and can clean my whole living/dining area in one time with the original crosswave whereas I had to stop 3 times to clean the pet hair from the pet crosswave. I also got a better clean with the original! So in my opinion the original is better than this one and cheaper as well!,3

Product cleans AND vacuums floors and carpets. I would not recommend depending on this to replace a good carpet cleaner, but little spots do seem to get cleaned up.

KayC.,5.0 out of 5 stars,2-chores-in-1,the United States,28-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I immediately unpacked this unit and put it to work. I watched a bunch of reviews and Bissell rose to the top almost every time.  It swept and cleaned the floor amazingly. On the area rug, maneuverability noticeably lessened, but wasn't anything hard to deal with. This won't clean stains or get the edges near the cabinet floor (it gets close), but, it picked up and cleans very well. 4 dogs live here and there's always a few pieces of small dog food around, it vacuumed them up easily. The dog hair was gone from the rug and the cleaning solution drew out the dirt. I did have to clean out the dirty water tank because the hair stopped the suction. Easy to clean out and the little debri scoop inside the tank made it easy to get large particles out of the dirty water. Highly recommend.",
swallace,2.0 out of 5 stars,A strong MEH,the United States,11-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The maneuverability and long cord are great! The hair trappers are handy, as is the self cleaning stand/mat. I wanted to love this thing but.... since it can’t get edges/ corners it cannot replace my regular vacuum. And because the mopping is so streaky it cannot replace a good old fashion mop and bucket. It’s a pretty expensive “in between deep cleans” tool. It’s all about technique. You have to vacuum each area then use the scrubber after to avoid streaking muddy hair rolls all over. If you have slightly uneven areas in your floor it will deposit dirty water when changing floor heights so tile is a no go. You have to use the scrub feature with patience and a specific method of spraying when pushing away from yourself and  slowly pulling the machine back toward you in order to get the best clean. Basically, my credit card points paid for it and I think it will be handy for little spills and mud paw season, maybe snow/salt, so I’ll probably keep it, we will see. For the cost, I’m disappointed and would not recommend anyone to buy it.",One

Barnes Family,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ignore the negative reviews,the United States,14-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this thing. I take care of it aswell. It has been used on my base carpeting that was stinky from the previous owners pets and the cat pee smell is now gone. I use it on my hard floors too. I use it in my bathroom, my kitchen, everywhere. I'm legally blind and have a hard time sweeping and vacuuming but this bissel makes me feel confident in my cleaning and my husband agrees. Alot of the negatives reviews I saw looked like they weren't cleaning theirs properly or emptying out the dump tank which obviously has a limit or itll leak. It takes me less than 10 minutes to clean the machine and is super easy to put back together. Do not get your air filter wet unless you want your house to smell sour. The only tricky part is the clear piece that covers the roller, sometimes it can be hard to put on but is still pretty easy. If it's not on properly, it isnt sealed properly, which will cause it to leak. The machine is light and very simple, you just need basic common sense and be willing to clean your tools. If you dont take care of something then obviously it isnt going to work well for you. I have just recently gotten a puppy and bought this a month ago knowing I would get animals in the future, it did amazing in getting our his liquid poops (first round of shots) from my carpet. Same with his little accidents on any flooring. My friend borrowed it a couple of days ago to clean her home and floors which contains 2 large long hair dogs and 1 weiner dog. All 3 were male and were peeing everywhere to mark. Her floors and carpet were ruined but she used my handy bissel and now her floor are stain free, her carpet smells great, and they look brand new. She did her whole house,( 4 bedroom 3 story) and didnt even completely fill up the tank. Even though it looked nasty, I still took the time (10 minutes) to clean out the hair, clean the pipe, the tank, the brush (I soak it in hot bleach water after removing the hair) , and the actual pieces themselves and now it look brand new again. I've used this thing about 20 times in the short time I've had it due to being picky about my floors and each time it has surprised me with how much it picks up amd how well it cleans. Ignore the negative reviews and buy the darn thing and see how magical it is for yourself.",
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not really worth the money,the United States,22-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited to get this machine because my whole house is either tile or laminate flooring and when i bought it, i had 3 cats and two dogs.  But once you've used it a few times, it really stinks.  The odor is so bad that I have to mop after using it!  It's a hassle having to stop and empty the reservoir so often.  You have to go over even the lightest spots OVER and OVER gain.  The ONLY saving grace this thing has is that I rarely have to sweep again after mopping.  Because it allows you to get the loose dirty and hair wet, it doesn't fly around and settle onto your wet floor.  Bottom line?

Buy it twice and it dies again...shame on you!",the United States,30-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought the first generation of the Crosswave and it died within a year. I then bought the second generation, the Pet Crosswave and even bought extra filters. Same issues, same vacuum. Nothing is different other than the strainer in the dirty water collector, it's now called The ""Pet"" Crosswave, it's a different color and cost more than the first generation. I kept it pristine and followed all the care instructions. I even rotated filters to make sure it did not have a wet or dirty filter when I used it again. It never was that great at cleaning up mild messes such as dirt the dogs brought in. The head would leak dirty water once it was turned off. Taking apart the vacuum to hand clean as instructed to do became difficult. Things were not fitting properly after disassembling and cleaning it every time as suggested to do. Seals were no longer air tight, it left the floor streaky. The wheels after they got wet would cause it to leave skid marks during use. It died after trying to vacuum up the clean water in the cleaning tray as instructed. I did everything right and it still died again. $300 is a lot to spend on a vacuum that barely lasted a year to a year and half. It starting to had issues after only having it for a few months after caring for it as instructed. I'm not impressed.",One
A. Chaffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Made my floors look great,the United States,13-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this vacuum because I have four dogs.  My husband kept telling me to get a mop system, and I decided to look into this.  We have tile and laminate floors through our whole house.  This vacuum really sucks up hair and dirt great.  I cleaned seven rooms (even under the furniture) with one bottle of cleaning solution.  I emptied the dirty container twice during this spree.  The first time it was full of hair and dust the second time I was finished cleaning and again it was full of hair and dirt.  It uses minimal water but still gets the floor clean.  I love that it does not leave a lot of water on the floor because with laminate you cannot leave heavy water sitting on the floor.  My floors looked great when I was done.  The shine on the floors was great.  I was using a swifter mop previously and it made my floors look so dull and dirty all the time.  This even sucked dust off my baseboards.  I was impressed.  Cleaning it afterward was not that bad either.  I can see why it would harbor horrible odor if you do not clean it after use.  It self cleans to a degree, but I took apart the components and cleaned everything really well and let it all air dry after use.  I am happy with this purchase.  I will update if anything changes.",
rebekkah richards,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So much hair, great with pets.",the United States,13-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"What i dislike is the cleaning it after useing it to clean lol.Also make sure you vacuum before using it if you havent vacuumed in a while, if you have pets.But what i love about it is how much dirt and hair that is picked up by it. Even when i just used the  main vacuum on my floors before using it.  Its amazing how much dog hair you can miss with your eyes. But this thing sucks it all up.  And i love how i can use it on the hard floor and my carpets. I love that the rollers are washable and can be used more than once. And you dont have to use their cleaning products in it. You can use regular cleaning product for the hard wood floors.",One
Hellsbells,5.0 out of 5 stars,Trial and error is key! There is a right and wrong way depending on the level of cleaning needed.,the United States,13-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I'm going to start of by saying that I've had this machine for a couple of months and have had to learn as I go. You quickly figure out that there are differences in how you have to do things depending pub how big a mess you are working with. There is definitely a learning curve, but trial and error is key.I have 3 dogs that have a combined weight of 600 lbs and three cats, two of which have very long hair. I have almost black hardwoods, stone tile with uneven texture, and an entryway that is huge with black and white marble checkerboard tiles with white grout on thin grout lines. All of these things cause me to change strategy depending on the type of mess. Example... My dogs are notorious for finding the only mud puddle in the yard after it rains. Two of them take a route through my family room with dark hardwoods, where the other one by-passes the familyroom and moves through the kitchen with uneven textured stone tiles and into the entry with the white, thin grout..... Add to this that the three of them plus the three cats shedding constantly causes me to sweep up an amount of fur equal to the size of a full grown Rottweiler every few hours (and I'm a neat freak but work full time).The brushes are very soft and require some repeated passes when you have dried mud in small crevices such as the stone or the thinner grout lines. In some cases, when I'm short on time, pre treating those areas with a spray hotly with solution and allowing them to soak while I work elsewhere is the best way to go. When I don't want to bend and spray cleaner on the floor and have more time, I position the rotating brush directly over those crevices and spray until all signs of dirt and grime are gone.However... For an insane amount of hair, rather than trying to mop and vacuum all at once, I've learned that just using the vacuum feature in a small area, then using the sweep/mop function works best. Otherwise, water on top of hair means hair collection on the rubber wheels and squeegee underneath the machine, which results in multiple passes to get all of it up.I can't complain about this vacuum/mop. If you get creative, it is simply amazing. I have about 1700 square feet of tile or hardwoods. This has cut my cleaning time in half, even with having to adjust strategies.My only complaints about the crosswave is that miserable excuse for a strainer.... It doesn't keep all of the hair from falling into the water tank. Easy enough fix... Use a sink drain strainer and then sterilize the sink afterwards.. And the self cleaning function only does so much to clean hair out of the roller compartment. Again, easy enough fix... After several uses, I use the self-cleaning function and then remove the roller cover and run it under the tap. Then I use a scrubber brush and paper towel to clean underneath where the squeegee and wheels collect hair. Again, my experiences are due to the size and number of shedding animals I have and are not the norm, so I can't hold the manufacturer responsible for tgose 2 small things being perfect for my situation. I very highly recommend the crosswave. I have not yet been disappointed.",2
Jeremy Bullard,2.0 out of 5 stars,"2.5 Stars - Great for Area Rugs, Not for Hardfloors",the United States,24-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was very excited to receive this based off all the reviews but was very disappointed with how it worked on my vinyl plank flooring.  It did not scrub the floors like I hoped.  All the smudge marks and footprints remained and the floor was still dirty.  It’s really hard to capture the smudge marks in a picture since my flooring is grey but after going over an area multiple times with the Crosswave I decided to spray it with some cleaner to see what dirt was left behind and took a picture of how dirty the paper towel I used after was.  That was just from a small area.  It did clean the area rugs really though and was able to pickup the dog hair that was entwined into the rugs.  However,  I’ll be returning it unfortunately, not what I hoped for.",
Writeit,2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves dirty black streaks after only a few months of use.,the United States,22-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"When I first got this product I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. The suction power is great and the mopping is so much easier. I kept it well, cleaned it meticulously because I was very happy with it and I wanted it to last, but it didn't make it past a few months of use before it began to leak a black dirty streak of water all over the floors. I cleaned it inside and out, meticulously, and even did what the website advised (apparently others have the same problem.) No use. If I use the product I have to clean up after it which makes it essentially useless. If it were a cheap $30 product, no problem. I'd just buy a new one, but at this price point, this is unacceptable. I also have the cordless crosswave. That one diead after only 3 uses. Bissell, your products are great when they work, but they should work more than once or twice, don't you think?",
ralban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad! Makes floor day easier!,the United States,28-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical about getting this after reading the reviews, but I've been pleasantly surprised.  Sure the cleaning it is kind of not fun, but really it's not that hard. For the time it saves me in doing my floors I'd gladly clean it each time I use it.  For quick jobs...like the dog messes on the floor, I still wind up grabbing the swiffer wet jet or good old fashioned wet towel and cleaner...mainly because I don't want to take it apart to clean it after a quick job like that.  It was taking me at least 2 hours to do my downstairs floors with sweeping, mopping and going back and forth to the sink to clean the mop and get more water.  This thing I only have to fill it 2 times and dump once in the middle to get the entire floor area.  It takes me an hour to do the floors now.  Even my 13 year old can do it!  I have not noticed any streaking or dirty water like some reviews said.  I would say they probably didn't clean it properly when using it.  It was a bit pricey, but because of Covid, I had the extra money from my cleaning lady not being able to come.  It has made my life easier for sure.  I don't feel like it is a great thing for deep cleaning, but for floor day to get up surface dirts it is perfect.",
Ralph Bobsin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ceramic Tile,the United States,25-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Used for first time. Confusing because mine came with two start buttons that both say hard floor.  Seems to clean quite well. The vacuum isn't very effective in my opinion. Wish I got the cordless one but thought it might have a weak vacuum. Who knew.  It's a bit of work to clean up when you finish using it. The strainer doesn't really catch as much as it should.  Have to restrain with a better one before pouring dirty water down the sink.  All in all, it cleaned the floor really well so hopefully it keeps working.",One

They spray function doesn’t get much solution out of the water tank either it just pushes the water I have gotten on the floors around. I took it to the Bissell repair place and they said the tank float was sticking and showed me how to make sure it was in the right position. This took a week and a half to diagnose. I took it home and tried to use it and it still isn’t working well. I want the dirty solution OFF the floors and I want to be able to use the spray function to empty the water bottle in less than a 29 minute time period for 1000 sq ft of wood floors.

elmo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great when it works, SAVE YOUR BOX",the United States,15-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the BISSELL Crosswave pet pro in  September 2018. The first 11 months it was fantastic. My have a 1700 square ft home with all tile floors. I have 3 dogs. It was the only unit that could actually clean my kitchen tile that had an uneven surface .  It requires you rinse all components after each use and clean and change filters. A year later the internal pump that ejects the water and solution died. I purchased the ASURION for 48.99. The claims process is not simple. I had to spend $25.00 on a box and shipping supplies to send the until for repair in October 2019. They state the Solution tank/Water Pump/Wiring Harness was replaced and returned it after 4 weeks. I used it for one hour after the repair. The second time I went to use it the solution was coming out too fast and now the vacuum does not suck up the water I checked the solution tank to make sure the lid was secured, rinsed the unit to check for clogs and replaced the filter. It is still not working. As the unit started to malfunction in September it worked inconsistently before finally breaking completely. I notice it has always struggled on very glossy tile. So I will be returning it to Asurion again today. At the cost of $299.00 it should last more than a year.  My advice it to purchase a warranty and keep your box to ship it for repair. The unit was wonderful when it worked.",

T.L88,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sadly it is going back,the United States,3-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Was really excited about this vacuum after reading so many positive reviews, but was greatly disappointed once I tried it. The vacuum is on the heavier side but the suction power is not great and it s not very maneuverable. After using this as dry vacuum I went over the same area with my Shark vacuum and was disappointed to see quite a large amount of dog hair in it even though I passed Bissell prior. I have a dog and two cats so suction power is important for me. One of the cats had a few accidents on the carpet and I was really hoping that this vacuum will do the job, but the odor stayed even after I spent a good amount of time on the spot with Bissell. That goes to the effectiveness of the pet cleaning solution that came with the vacuum. I tried it on the tile floor and it was not bad, the floor dried fairly quickly. Overall I'm disappointed and sending it back....",
Gwenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says it will,the United States,22-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I just made my first run with the Crosswave Pet Pro.  Wow. Everything is in the box. Easy assembly. Got to work right away. Vacuum and scrub happens at the same time. Floor is then wet but not puddled. Vacum without solution quickly removes all water and total dry in about 10 minutes.  Dirty water tank was mud!  Yes, it had been awhile since I cleaned.  I have all wood floors and two terriers. We live in the mountains so there is a lot of dirt. And dog hair, dried on spills, pee pee spots, and more. Tray/stand holds crosswave and parts. Also serves as a cleaning stand. Very clever.  The review asks for “deep cleaning” review.  Deep cleaning is different for everyone. My floors had not been mopped in months. Look great now.",
I like to buy things,2.0 out of 5 stars,It’s too complicated for everyday use,the United States,9-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,CONS:The concept is great however there is just way too much work involved. YES it cleans better than a regular mop/spray mops BUT it takes LONGER because you have to stop and clean the dang thing every 5 minutes (depending on how big the area you’re cleaning is & how messy) If you have pets that shed a lot make sure to stock up on extra air filters because you WILL need them.FYI: If you’re experiencing tracks of dirty water being left behind it’s probably due to a dirty filter or dirt/hair accumulation at the bottom of the vacuum.PROS:- suction is good and the brush does a good job at cleaning up dry messes.- extra parts available on Amazon for cheapMy HONEST opinion: Not worth the money. I only use this to clean my whole downstairs area (around 1100 sq ft) and I spend at least an hour and a half vacuuming/mopping (half if not most of the time is spent cleaning the vacuum/mop). It’s good for deep cleaning maybe once a week or every two weeks but not for everyday use because it’ll just take waaayyy too much time. If you’re looking for everyday cleaning I would look into the new shark dry/wet vacuum seems much more convenient.,
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,1-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love my crosswave. I have two indoor cats and it cleans their hair up good. I saw most comments saying the down fall is cleaning it every time you use it. Yes it is but the fact I can vacuum and mop, my area rugs and even vacuum my couch  in under 20 and the house looks and smells amazing is well worth it to me. I do recommend dumping you waste in the toilet and throughly cleaning and allowing them to air out properly with each use. Or it’s like any other dirty water sitting, it can smell swampy! If it does I just drop some vinegar on the ground and suck it up to help deoderize it.",4
Sandy L,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans what others miss.,the United States,25-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Before buying the Bissell Crosswave I had a Hoover FloorMate.  The FloorMate was too heavy and bulky for me to operate (I bought it when I was much younger), so I decided to give the Crosswave a try.  The tile I'm expecting these machines to clean has such a rough and irregular surface that if it is mopped with a sponge mop, it will shred the mop, not clean the floor.  My previous cleaner left dirty water in the crevices created by the tile pattern, so it never looked really clean.  I just finished the entire floor with the Crosswave and Bissell Multi-Surface Pet cleaner and I was pleasantly surprised.  The yellow haze the old cleaner left was gone.  I now have white, glowing tile.  I love that all the parts click into place, so I know I have assembled the machine properly.  I like the way the brush roller is cleaned after finishing the floors.  The Crosswave is an attractive machine that looks great on the floor of my laundry room.  With 5 animals who all shed and a real need for a clean home, this is the best cleaner for the money I have every used!  I highly recommend it!",

If you look at where the roller is, it'll only make a few wet lines with a dry line in the middle. The brush does not seem to actually clean the floor. This is a glorified vacuum with a shorter cord than my regular vacuum and therefore is not much use to me unfortunately.This may be good if you do not want to clean up really nasty messes, but do not mind cleaning the really nasty messes out of your vacuum.",One
Judy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved it at first, for 3 months. Money wasted.",the United States,24-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"tldr; repeat problems even after going through bissell repair shop and customer service to no help.This product was a lifesaver for me for the first 3 months. It was being used daily to every other day to clean my hardwood floors and a single small area rug. I have 2 cats and a toddler, so messes were on the regular. The routine every night was to pick up all large debris, use the cross wave, then take it apart and thoroughly clean all the pieces. It felt like it cleaned my floors so much better than my previous sweeping and swiffer - like mopping. I still deep cleaned the floors every month with another product, and ran a robot vaccuum throughout the day to pick up debris.It saved time on the actual cleaning of the floors, though cleaning the cross wave itself took quite some time (I would wash the brush/dirty tank, filter, and plastic pieces by hand each night) so it turned out to be about equal time - perhaps longer - but a much better job.However, after about 2.5 - 3 months suddenly solution stopped coming out of one side. I followed the troubleshooting instructions but it only helped for the first 30 seconds or so of using solution. Soon after both sides stopped spraying solution - it became a standard weak vacuum.I contacted Bissell customer care and got a generic response that wasn't even related to my problem, but they did tell me if their ""solution"" did not work I could take it to the ONLY authorized repair shop on the Island (I'm in Hawaii - no other option). Despite the repair shop being 1-2 hours away in traffic, paid parking, and tiny, I went ahead and took it in because I was so looking forward to this product working again  - I wanted so bad for it to work.I won't discuss the repair shop because Bissell and them are seperate, however Bissell did cover the cost of repairs - I have no idea was what ""repaired"". The person who I picked the crosswave up from said ""they repaired uh.. something called.. (insert mumble here).. I don't know what that is though. But they gave you a new filter too!"" so that was no help.Turns out I don't know what was repaired! I came home and started using it and it was working - REJOICE! ... for about 5 minutes. Half way through doing my floor the flow of cleaning solution stopped on one side, again. Just as it had before. I had made sure to tell the repair shop that it would work for about 1-2 minutes after troubleshooting each time, then stop. This time it worked for about 5 minutes then stopped. It still continues to only work for the first few seconds after pressing the button, then stops for the remainder of the day. In addition now the cleaning solution container is leaking - something that was not occurring before hand. It does not leak when not in the machine, but if left in the machine over night the solution all leaks out - which makes me think it is something to do with perhaps what was repaired? I have no idea.Overall... its an amazing product and concept and works great with kids and pet messes... until it stops working. With frequent uses it stopped working within 3 months and has turned into a waste of money. Very disappointed.",One
Collette,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's more trouble than it's worth,the United States,2-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"When I  first got this machine , I loved it ! Then after a few uses and making sure I cleaned it after each use , it got harder and harder to clean it.  I would have to handscrub the brushes because using the the cleaning base  Just wasn't getting the brushes clean enough and it was actually making my making my area rug look worse than better. In my opinion the tank needs to be larger and the hose connecting the base to the tank and suction tube inside the tank need to be larger in circumference.  It's gotten to the point where I only use this when I need to either either wetmop just the hard surfaces Or spot clean on my area  rugs.  I live in Florida and I have 2 dogs and 2 cats,  So I not only have fur but I also have sand, and when  I use the hard floor cleaner for just the vacuum It ends up only sucking up a portion and then leaving a pile on the floor when I stand it upright then when  I take it over to the area rug and switch to that setting to that setting it ends up leaving hairballs all over my carpet . So I end up taking twice as long to clean and it ends up being easier to just use my let's use my old Bissell power force vacuum 1st and then you use the Crosswave to wet mop and spot clean. I'm really disappointed in this product.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,This saves us a lot of time cleaning our vacation rental!,the United States,17-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So, we spent many weeks researching and made the huge mistake of buying the big green complete first. We quickly sent that dinosaur, floor scratching, no suction machine back! We have a vacation rental with vinyl flooring and my wife also cleans 2-3 other vacation rentals with hard wood floors and vinyl. The old way of cleaning was sweep the corners and under and around stuff, then vacuum everywhere and then swiffer mop 2 times to have a clean looking floor. That was a 3 step process... Now, with this new vacuum, that 3 step process is more like just a one and done and it really cleans the floor and gets up all that invisible dirt.Pros would be that it seriously cleans your floor of things you had no idea were there and you can wipe your hands on the floor to test. We end up with the container full 2 times per turn over which is 3 times a week. It is super brown and full of hair and all kinds of stuff. It is pretty compact and easy to carry and move around. It cuts our cleaning turn over time way down, which means more $$$ for us!Cons would be that there are a lot of parts to open up and clean after doing half a house lets say, but it only takes 5 minutes honesty. It only lays down at about a 45 degree angle, so you only kind of get under beds or other furniture. There are no detachments, but why?? Also, you sort of have to rethink how you vacuum which makes sense of how it is designed. It only sucks up debris when you move it forward. When you move it backwards, it slides debris into a pile which you then have to sort of go behind it and go over it in a forward motion. So, you essentially vacuum/clean one line at a time if that makes sense. It totally works great this way, but its not how our brains have always vacuumed, which is back and forth and all over the place really fast. Once you rethink how it is done and sort of slow down a little, you end up with a super clean floor.Overall the cons are not enough to give it a bad review. For us, cleaning vacation rentals and saving tons of time and ending up with floors so clean you can lie down on them, we are definitely fans and I can't wait for them to come out with a new model that can go further under furniture and comes with attachments!!",One
E. Pfanner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best floor cleaner for hard surfaces!!!,the United States,10-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This has to be one of my best purchases!  Being able to vacuum and mop at the same time is awesome!  I love the scent of the pet solution and it makes the house smell clean. We have 4 small dogs and 2 cats and I strive to ensure that guests can’t tell by just walking into my house and smelling the air!  There’s only one thing I’d change about this vacuum…make it cordless. I have seen a cordless cross wave since I purchased this one…that will be my next one when this one is retired. Feel so much better about mopping and think the floor is much cleaner than it is with a Swiffer since this doesn’t just push dirt around on the floor!  Great product…I love it!!!!

But real life is 4 cats, 3 dogs and country life.  I have water proof laminate ….  this did amazing work.  I was concerned not a strong vacuum.... well it sucked the fur bunnies out from behind the door, right under the edge!!  The mop roller has little scrubbies… On really dirty/ground in stuff... you do have to go slow...but heck it does it!!!  I give it a 4 as it is a bit heavy... now I am older and have arthritis in my hands and arms... HOWEVER... not so heavy I could not do my entire house in one go... 3000 sq ft.. all solid surface flooring.  It rolls easily, quickly switches from floor to area rug... does a great job on the rubber mat  in front of stove.  So this was week one.... I will update in a few months... needless to say it is going to be used at least 4-7 times a week at my house....UPDATE:  have been using for couple weeks now.... just as wonderful...maybe more so... than the first time.  Like the ability to get the roller damp and then just ""dust mop"" areas that don't need mopping, but need a little more ""fresh"" than just vacuuming.  I have long to short hair pets -- it sucks it all up.  Have birds - sucks up their feathers...  Have cats - sucks up the kitty litter tracked down the hall.  Issues I have found - 1. the cord could be about 3 ft longer for my house - but that is why there are extension cords. 2 - it does not go flat enough to go under my couch - nothing else did -- but neither does this  3. it will not go along side the master toilet - toilet too close to wall.  Does great in guest and half bath.  4.  Does not have an auto setting to run by itself!!!  one can only hope I live long enough for that!",

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,2306A Model - My thoughts,the United States,29-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Purchased Cross Wave 2306A model back in Sept or Oct of 2020, to clean up after 4 puppies that were in potty training and the hair. At first didn't have any issues but now slowly starting to run into problems.First I am not sure if its just be but the tank that holds dirty water, has stopped sealing correctly. I did check the tank for cracks and everything just to make sure and there is no damage on it. If the tank is completely dry I don't have any issues but if I clean it out and try running it out to finish up the floors that's when the machine starts to act up like loosing suction and spitting water out of the side. Next when I purchased the machine I got a kit with replacement brushes and filters (they weren't Bissell brand), that is a BIG NO NO, when it comes to filters at least. I tried different brands and read a lot of reviews before making a purchased and so far no luck with any other filters other then the Bissell.  If you start seeming smears on the floors its time to replace the brushes I do that pretty frequently.

Sean F,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get it if your time is valuable,the United States,9-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Wonderful tool. I bought this for my wife because she's nuts about cleaning the floors. She was using a Swiffer stick thing and it just took forever. I bought this and it is such a timesaver. It picks up dry and wet stuff, leaves the floors looking nice and, if you use the formula made for it, smells subtlely pleasant. We used it when we moved out and when we came back to drop off our keys we were greeted with that smell and sparkling floors. The strainer is nice and catches tons of hair and dog fur from the hardwood.Finally, it's easy to clean and put back together after. Love that you can see all the nasty it picked up - the stick just doesn't compare",
M. Walsh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans well but you have to clean IT!,the United States,1-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I like this dual use cleaner,  it does a good job on spot cleaning or wholly cleaning area rugs - in particular cleaning up after pet messes. It’s easy to maneuver, is quiet and very simple to use. One drawback it that it is a little bit time consuming to clean after each use (the last one we had broke because we had forgotten to clean it after a very heavy use- so we got a new one) 4 stars for the breakage! Otherwise it’s handy and does the job for our house with d pets who have accidents.",2
Deborah M. Kauffman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great on hardwood an tile, not so great on rugs",the United States,3-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I do like this floor cleaner a lot. It's a godsend for hardwood and tile, especially when you have pets who shed a TON. My only complaint is that it really does not do well for deep cleaning carpet/rugs, despite the area rug feature. It's a okay vacuum but using the wet deep clean function just seems to spread the dirt around, not clean it out. Taking a star off for that one flaw. If you have hardwood, tile, or vinyl flooring, this really gets all the dirt up and cleans the floors well. Just don't use it on carpet/rugs.",One
Keith H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,You won’t be disappointed,the United States,5-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I have about 2000 sq ft of wood floors in my home.  This is a great tool for the job.  Using the Bissell wood floor cleaning solution really  makes the floors look good.  (Should sell in Gallon containers).  The only negative I have is when you put the handle in the upright position you have to really make sure it locks in the upright position or it will fall over.  I also bought one for my daughter’s house.  Like any took you must clean it Bissell makes it pretty easy but still a little messy.  I purchased the corded version.  They do make a battery version also.  They need to work on the edge cleaning to make it a perfect machine.,One
Craig Tsutsumi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer beware.,the United States,19-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If I could give this zero stars I would. My husband bought this for me for a present because I raved about it because of the commercials and demo videos on the website. Talk about false advertising!! Suction was awful, took forever to clean, had to go so slow and over things multiple times (mind you I keep my house pretty clean so nothing was ‘stuck’ on my floors’. After a couple uses the unit began to stink so bad.. yes, I fully cleaned it after each use AND set it outside to fully dry. Save your money and stick with a regular vacuum and bona floor cleaner! NOT WORTH IT!",6

Very well built and designed product. I live on the beach with 2 puppies so sand and dirt is a constant battle. This sucks up all the sand then cleans my floors fast, little water left on my laminate floors which dries fast.Got the corded vacuum as I have 5 rooms to keep up with and the battery operated one only last 20 minutes before juice runs down.One large mixed bottle of water and cleaner does the job. The low amount of concentrated cleaner needed will last for months.It’s an amazing vacuum and floor scrubber. Can’t believe how long I lived without it.

Ashlee Sarver,5.0 out of 5 stars,Skip the sweeping!,the United States,12-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this about a year ago, and wanted to use it for a while before I reviewed. I have loved it from the first use! My family moved from a mostly carpeted house, to one that has many hard surface floors (tile, laminate and hard wood). This works well on all of them! My main reason for getting it was I wanted a machine that deep cleaned the floors well, but I also didn’t want to have to sweep as well as mop. This does a great job at both!! I have watched this machine pick up solids like Cheerios, dog food, and most recently corn kernels (my 2-year old made a mess of jell-o and corn all over the floor. My husband wanted to sweep up the corn first, and I told him no need!). This was one of the best purchases we have made for our new home!",
Fp morgan,5.0 out of 5 stars,lifesaver,the United States,24-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had mopped the floors (700 sq feet of tile) and then used the Bissell crosswave Pet Pro.  I was stunned that the water came out black.  I have not tried it on my wood floors yet.  the solution works great and leaves the house smelling fresh.  Best of all it is so easy to empty and clean.  I had a previous floor cleaning machine that did not work anywhere near as well as well and was difficult to clean, had suction issues, and was not efficient.  The features on the crosswave are amazing. love that I can clean the brush head in the crosswave holder, is easy to insert and remove,  has an extra brush head, filter is easy to remove and clean, has a strainer and vacumns small debris.  I have back issues so I was not sure if this would be too heavy. It is not.  What can I say best cleaner I have tried and I have tried many.  Although it was pricey, worth every penny spent.",2

So my floors are constantly messy. This has cut my cleaning time in half if not more. Before purchasing I saw a lot of reviews complaining about cleaning the machine out, but it's really not that big of a deal. Would you normally empty a vaccum and rinse out the mop and bucket when you were done with them? I really don't see the issue.",4
Kool Grannie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed, bought this one over cheaper other models because of Bissell reputation.",the United States,19-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Bought this for my vinyl plank flooring.

Sorry I bought this one, won't buy another one!!*****  UPDATE. *****  MARCH / 2021. *****Bissel offered to send me a new machine, since mine obviously has issues. Havent received yet, so cant change my review at this time.

TayRoe,3.0 out of 5 stars,Love it but not sure it lives up to the price,the United States,31-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love how quick and easy this is to use. Great when you have little kids and pets and have to clean up constantly but don’t want to have to get the broom and mop out. My biggest complaint is the tank is really small so you can’t do to much because if it hits the full line it starts to move the dirt water back through onto the floor. I would also say it’s not a deep cleaner. The suction isn’t powerful enough. On deep clean days I typically vacuum first then go back over with this.,One
blooberd,1.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATED REVIEW: Totally Useless and Disappointing,the United States,19-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The first couple times this thing was great but beyond that, not so much. It’s been only ten months under very light use, and the suction is completely gone. It now drags dirty water around, leaves streaks, won’t go through it’s cleaning phase at all (you have to run a bunch of clean water through the machine to clean it), and the parts get gross even though I clean them. You would really need to pressure wash them regularly because there are so many little grooves, but that’s something you could live with. This thing just doesn’t work anymore and it didn’t work well for very long. Going back to a mop and pail, I guess! Won’t waste as much money or time that way.Old review: I am extremely happy with the floor cleaning ability of the Pet Pro. It has a great suction and even gets rid of stuck on spots. The roller has a combination of soft brush and then harder bristles that work on the stuck on spots, but aren't hard enough to scratch the floor. I read complaints about having to clean after, and this is true -- you definitely have to clean your machine after you use it. The first time this was a bit of a pain and I ended up with splashes of water around, but the second time I got my groove and it's not a big deal -- certainly better than getting down on my hands and knees to clean the floor. So as long as you are mentally prepared for that final task, this is a great machine. I have not tried it on carpet that much as just a vacuum, but I did do a wet vac over a small portion that the dog had peed on and it worked super.",
Amanda,5.0 out of 5 stars,👍👍👍👍👍 Crosswave Pet!,the United States,22-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Today I recieved my crosswave pet and .... I love it!  My floors have never been cleaner!The unit is easy to use and it leaves nothing behind!  It's get good and close to the baseboards and sucked ALOT of cat hair from under my appliances. The waste container fills quickly (after about 200sq ft) but is easy to empty and rinse!  It was easy to disassemble and clean qhen I done cleaning. The cleaner provided did a good job but I did use a whole bottle cause I have alot of hardwood. However, you mix the cleaner in the water yourself so I plan to use my regular cleaner in the future.  Overall I'm very satisfied and I hope it lasts a long time!",
Jen,4.0 out of 5 stars,It needs a light in the front,the United States,26-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I manage a very large VRBO home on the beach. Sand is my nemesis. I would have preferred the cordless version but the battery life wasn’t sufficient for how big the house is. I used it the first time after vacuuming with my regular vacuum and it did a great job of getting the suntan lotion residue off the vinyl plank floor.Cleaning the unit was easy enough but I didn’t have large spills or chunky pieces.If I had to give any constructive criticism, It would be having a light on the front if it.  That would be a nice thing to have. Other than that, it works for what I need it to and I would recommend it for like use",One
Christina Bekhov,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not super impressed.,the United States,5-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited about this product and researched the brand a lot. Most of our space is hardwood flooring with a huge rug in the living room. Here are some things I noted after my first use.Pros:- Super fast cleaning. Love that I don't have to sweep then mop! Huge time saver!- Small and doesn't take up much space in my kitchen.- Does a decent job on hardwood floors.- Floors looked cleaner than usually cleaning methods.- The rug options works well for a deeper clean.Cons:- Does not work on textured carpet at all! This was a big deal because we have 2 dogs and 1 toddler and I need something that can work on textured carpet.- Does not come close to the walls or table legs, so I'll still have to get out our Swiffer Sweeper to clean those areas.- The cleaner is ok, but does leave some residue on the floor ..maybe I need to use my normal cleaner.- Super loud. Much louder then my other vacuum.- Center area of the brush did not release as much water as the side, unless it was on the rug option.Overall, not super impressed with this product, bit does save time on cleaning.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is great for messy floors!,the United States,2-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’ve had this Bissell for about a month. I have four dogs in the house - two are German Shepherds - and I also have three human boys. This Bissell has been great. It really does take half the time to clean my floors since I don’t have to use two different machines. I have a Shark steam mop and the Bissell makes my floors feel much cleaner than the steam mop does. The cleaning solution smells great and isn’t terribly expensive. Bissell gives you 50% off of your first order if you buy from them, so stock up!Pros:Cleans thoroughlyEasy to put togetherEasy to useCleans area rugs - very easy to switch from hard floor to area rugsEasy for kids to useFun to use (I know, weird)Cons or things to note:Thoroughly cleaning the machine takes a little time. The instructions suggest letting all parts dry before you put them back together. If you don’t, it will smell a little musty when you use the machine next time.The brush cleaning tray works well, but can spill a little water and hold on to some hair.You will have to empty the dirty water container more than once during cleaning if you are cleaning a large area, or if you are cleaning a lot of dog/cat hair, or very dirty floors.There’s a tray in the dirty water reservoir to lift out hair, etc to throw away. It’s a little small/flimsy so some solid will not be lifted out.The pros outweigh the cons. So far, I’m really pleased with it.",One
GrammaB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine!,the United States,6-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to clean the large amount of ceramic tile in my home. I previously have had the Hoover floor scrubber machines that vacuum up the dirty water after they scrub and I really liked them. I love that I don't have to vacuum the floor before I use this machine. I like being able to remove the animal hair and trash that the strainer catches before I dump the dirty water down the sink.  When the floors are extra dirty with muddy footprints from a large dog I have to clean out the tank and scrubber bar more often but this is easily done. Like all other floor scrubbers that I have used, this doesn't clean all of the way to the edge of the floor, but it cleans to less than an inch from the edge which is great. Hair hasn't wrapped around the scrubber bar as advertised. This is great because it is a big problem if I vacuum. I highly recommend this machine.",5
maria ragsdale,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have 3 dogs, keep your heavy duty carpet cleaner",the United States,9-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,The vacuum part works nice doesn’t get the corners though. It does work on area right like literally puppy took a poo on my area rug while I was at work and after drying for a few hours I picked up the solid and it cleaned the marks out of my rug. You definitely want to clean it out after each use or it will smell like death. I’ve been trying different cleaning solutions but some of them leave a film after. It’s a great tool but for the amount of liquid left on the floors it’s not work the price. Might not be best for someone with original hard wood floors,One
JanMarie,5.0 out of 5 stars,It delivers!,the United States,27-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had been hearing wonderful things about this item, but I've been very leery about ordering the Bissell Pet Pro.  I'm so glad I took the chance!  I love this thing!  I'm so tired of vacuuming the floors, then going back over them with my mop.  I can't believe how well it vacuums up wads of dog hair ( I have two Labrador Retrievers) AND scrubs the floor!  The floors dry quickly, too, usually by the time I'm finished in each room.  I ordered the unit with solution.  While the solution provided cleans well, and smells good, I wanted more of a shine on my wood floors.  When I used up the solution, I ordered Pledge floor cleaner concentrate.  Just received it today, so I'll clean the floors tomorrow and see how that works.",One
Christina,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth,the United States,22-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to like this product, and I had hoped that it would make cleaning and my life easier, but that is not the case. It needs to be cleaned thoroughly midway through my cleaning. If you do not clean it, the mop head saturates the floor, and that is not good for wood floors. And cleaning this thing is not quick. It needs to be taken apart and rinsed. And I also had to replace the mop brush. Hair gets stuck in around five different places as well. So on cleaning day, this needs to be cleaned twice, in the middle of cleaning, and afterwards. It would take less time to separately sweep/vacuum the floor and then mop. Plus the wheels left track marks on my wood floor, so I'm not very pleased with that.",
Keylin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,the United States,7-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It is incredible to see the dirty water container, and we thought we deep cleaned the house! With 3 pets you bet the floors need some assistance, sooo this tool does the work.The only con is that it does not get to the edges, so you'll have to go through using a rag.Some reviews mention the high noise and dirty water poured all over the floor. Make sure you read the instructions... the tank does not fill fully, it has a level marker so when the water reaches it, the suction level goes up meaning you have to empty the tank.I use warm water and mild solution and the smell is amazing... Freshly cleaned house and great mood ;)One last thing and is kinda obvious, it does not reaches under the bed and those small spaces.Overall we are thrilled 😄",
AussiegirlIngrid,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is GREAT!,the United States,26-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have 4 dogs. Need I say more? I have been buying Bissell for the last 12 years  and love the regular carpet shampooer one and have the cross wave for my dad's place as he has linoleum. This one is a bit stronger. It has the water tank and dirt tank separate and I make sure there are no dog toys or urine from my one senior dog,  then I do a good scrub. My tile was just put down, so I am still cleaning up the remains of the grout too. I love the suction and ease with which this comes apart and washes out each section. If you ever had a Bissel carpet cleaner they all come apart the same way. The Brush roller pops out and I just go out to the hose spigot and take it all apart and rinse it in the yard. Let the roller dry in the sun before reassembling. Replacement parts are fair priced at the Bissle website and thanks to Amazon, I found 2 roller bars for my old Bissel Momentum they don't make anymore. Woo Hoo. I am a loyal fan of Bissle and you can find them on social media with the updates on the pet rescue they contribute to all the time. Cathy Bissel does so much pet rescue I don't mind spending the money for such a great product. This is a no brainer.",
Kate O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful item. Clean after use.,the United States,22-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I did not take a video when I used it in some areas mostly because I forgot. I bought the Bissell crosswave pet style and I love it! If you have a woman or kids/teens in the house, then buy this model! There is a piece inside the dirty water collector that pulls up and moves all the large debris....Legos, hair, small toy pieces, and it shows up right there and you can grab it out with no hassle. It does a really good job cleaning, but I have noticed I do have to make a handful of passes occasionally depending on what is on the floor.It is faster than sweeping then mopping still, but make sure you take the time to rinse all the pieces after use with warm water and allow to air dry before putting it all back together. Theb11 year old used it and didn't clean and when I started it up I could tell by the smell right away.It is an amazing product!",
michaela,1.0 out of 5 stars,DONT BUY,the United States,4-Oct-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Barely cleans anything. Says it can handle dog hair yet it doesnt pick any of it up and I have to clean the brush every 5 minutes if I want it to actually pick up things. It also keeps smelling burnt so I cleaned it out and the actual plastic melts because it gets hot if you vacuum for more than 10 min without cleaning it. Buy if you're a moron. The good reviews are obviously fake seeing as I did a ton of research before I bought it. Also the shampoo part. Dont even try I've cleaned up stains with a brush and soap and it worked better than this. I haven't had a stain it actually gets rid of,4

Consequently, our laminated and tiled floors get dirty.......quickly.  :/  I'd love to say I vacuum daily, but I don't.  When I watched an infomercial on this product, I asked my husband to give me his opinion........we bought it and LOVE IT!  We, of course, vacuum first, and followed up with the Crosswave.  I did use the cleaner that came with the product, and it was not an overpowering smell.....a very light fragrance.  Our home is quite large with a lot of flooring, but this took very little time at all!  It gets into corners very nicely, however doesn't go completely flat to get under a bed.  I'm so impressed with how well it cleaned, I'm almost excited to vacuum again!!!  Well, not, but you get the idea.  Clean up is also a breeze!!!  VERY satisfied customer!  Thank you!",2
Moonchild,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Magical hardwood, and linoleum cleaner.",the United States,30-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this machine!  I used it for two months now, and I still love it. I was skeptical in the beginning bc of ppl mentioning the aftercare. But, it's no biggie, and very simple.  Actually it promotes longevity of the machine, and that no foul smells linger.  I have hard wood floors throughout my home, and many pets.  This machine is a time savor, and my floors always look great. It picks all the hair up with no problem, long or short.  It scrubs my floors in areas that need a little extra attention with ease. (I bump it up to the carpet option).  The ONLY thing I have any complaints about is that it doesn't get right up against my floor boards, and I have to manually clean those myself.  There is a 1/2"" gap between the cleaner path, and the wall.  I've heard the newest machine is built to clean up against your walls so this would be the last star needed for becoming a perfect product.  I've had so many cleaners in the past, but this one replaces them all!",
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Happy With My Purchase,the United States,10-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Pros: does a very nice job of vacuuming and mopping for the price. My floors look and feel very clean after using. After cleaning the floors, the Crosswave goes back into a tray base and easily self cleans with a few cups of water. The Bissell cleaning solution samples that came with this left my house smelling clean and fresh.Cons: it’s very noisy and can leave some wet spots on my hardwood floor. (To be fair, this could be a my fault as a new user, but I’ve used it several times and I have found small pools of water from it on my floor after each use. I simply dry with a small cotton towel). I also dislike having to remove the brush roller after cleaning each time so it can dry but if you don’t it won’t properly dry due to the plastic cover over it.I purposely chose the corded version because I didn’t want to deal with the docking station but my friend has the much pricier cordless Crosswave and she loves it. I am very happy with this purchase.",
Amy Grace,5.0 out of 5 stars,still going after a year!,the United States,8-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I took a leap of faith when I ordered this thing, but it's been pretty helpful on my wood-look ceramic tile floor.  granted, it won't clean off hard, nasty bits from the grout, but I just keep a toothbrush in my pocket and scrub the sticky bits that get missed.  I mostly use it on hard floors, but I have two door mats (think carpeted floor mats for cars) that clean up just fine.  it's GREAT on dog hair, crumbs, and pine needles. it's easy to clean too.  for a cleaning solution, I  just use vinegar water (sometimes with a couple drops of peppermint essential oil)  instead of that nasty (probably toxic) chemical hard floor cleaner it came with.",One
GS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive and useless after a few uses,the United States,15-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Update:  We tried to contact customer service and had no luck.  We don’t use the vacuum at all because it is loud and doesn’t work.This vacuum is good for the first one or two times you use it.  After that you are taking it apart and cleaning it after every use and you will be continuously buying new filters and brushes.  It stopped sucking anything up at one point then just started again.It does not wash or clean any carpeting.  The water does not stay separate from any debris so you get this mushy mess to clean out when you’re done.A small piece prime off when I went from tile to carpeting so it does not transfer easily at all.Save your money and invest in a vacuum and a separate carpet cleaner.,

Now I use a hard floor vacuum before using this to ensure no litter is around, but for other dirt/debris it works fine. The suction of the liquid could be better, the point is to save time which doesn't happen when you have to continually go over the same spot you mopped.

PMRisher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a Quick Solution - But a Good One,the United States,19-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have a home of five - myself, two dogs, and two birds.  Most of the house is either tile or hard wood.  I needed a better solution to getting the floors clean - it is a constant battle.  I love this tool - but there are a couple of things I've learned.  My only regret is that I should have bought the cordless version.  I have a Dyson cordless sweeper and quickly realized that dragging a cord around is a pain.  Also, for me (and I'm old but mechanical), there was a learning curve and I had immediately to order a resupply of cleaner.  One of the things I would recommend is watching the Bissel YouTube videos - they were very helpful.  I would definitely recommend this product.",
Heather Rawls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Hard Floor Cleaner for Cleaning Pet Urine,the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have had several floor cleaners before this one and was not happy with them.  They either weighed a lot or smelled terrible when the cleaner was running.  This floor cleaner is small, easy to move around the house, and the solution that comes with the cleaner eliminates the bad smell while you are using it. Even though the tank is relatively small, you can still clean a large area. I just cleaned the roller and corresponding areas, and it was sooo easy.  There is not a bunch of places for things to get trapped.  Emptying dirty water is not bad as the smell is basically neutralized by the solution you use.  I use a floor cleaner multiple times a day as I have 5 dogs and 3 cats.  This machine is awesome.I have now had this floor cleaner for several months and I use it almost every day and it is working great.  I am considering odering another one for upstairs as I am lazy.",

We have a fairly large backyard with a doggie door and the dogs are constantly in and out, tracking mud everywhere. Between the shedding, the mud, and the accidents on the rugs, cleaning the floors was beginning to take a lot of time everyday. I was hoping that this product will save me some time. When cleaning the hardwood floors, it left smears and looked like it just made the dirt wet and pushed it around. It barely vacuumed and when it came to cleaning the carpet, it's the same issue. I tried to clean up an accident and I am pretty sure it just made the area wet and then pushed it around the carpet. It definitely did not clean it all. Maybe I am expecting too much out of it and it is not for deep cleaning, just casual everyday maintenance. Regardless, it did not live up to the hype and I returned it. I definitely do not recommend this.",2

The first use was amazing. My area rugs and tile floors never looked so amazing! It has amazing suction power - I would say almost as good as my Dyson.The issues with this machine are two fold. You have to have to have to clean the brushes after every use and it takes forever and they really don’t get that clean so when I tried to use it the second time it stunk up my house bc they weren’t cleaned well enough. I finally went in and soaked the brushes and put new ones on but much go my surprise on the 3rd use the whole thing died. Luckily it was within the 30 days so I could return it.I really thought this machine was going to be a game changer - I wanted it to be one but unfortunately Bissell needs to find a better way to pull off the brushes for cleaning and I’m still unsure as to why it stopped working altogether after only a few uses.,
Renee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Tool for Cleaning,the United States,19-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is my 2nd Crosswave.  I'm disappointed to be purchasing a 2nd one in less than a year however I couldn't find my receipt to return my first one to Bed Bath & Beyond.  My first was just ""crosswave"".  This one is specifically for pets.  The only difference is the $20 roller brush (you do get 2) and the liquid pet product.  I love the ability to go from tile/hardwood to an area rug.  I do vacuum everything first but this picks up what the vacuum misses.",2
Caera,5.0 out of 5 stars,THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!,the United States,24-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It passes the ""wipe the floor with a paper towel when I'm done"" test. It picks up dog hair I can't even SEE, even though I sweep my floors EVERY day! Instructions are excellent. Very easy to follow. It works exactly like the video shows. VERY happy with this purchase. Also like the fact they put scent in their soap. I had a different cleaner in the past that didn't have that. I will definitely buy this model again in the future!",One
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,this works great as a power mop,the United States,26-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Hi,I have 3 Labs 100 lbs, I use my Dyson to pick up the huge amount of hair they drop in the springBUT I use the Bissell to remove the drool that is now dry and the paw prints because they leave prints on the laminate floorthe Bissel made fast work of cleaning my Laminate flooring making it look new after a very bad winter 3 huge dogs, I could never get the gunk off the floor !! I wet mopped, I used Windex and micro towels, the only way it clean is with this wash and vacuum that sucks the dirty water upI see in videos they try and use the Bissel the clean things I would clean up with paper towel before the power mop, if you use this as a power mop it's greatRick klare",
Kelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,the United States,4-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I am absolutely in love with this contraption! I opted for this older corded version as opposed to the new cordless max after reading reviews and finding out that the cordless version only stays charged for about 30 minutes! And being that my ENTIRE house is hardwood except the kitchen, which is ceramic tile, I felt like it would be a hassle to have to stop and recharge after 30 minutes and wait 2 or 3 hours before continuing my floor cleaning process! I have only used it in my master bedroom, hallway and kitchen, but I couldn't be more impressed! It is so convenient to vacuum and mop at the same time, it sucks up EVERYTHING in its path and I even cleaned my smaller throw rugs so I didnt have to throw them in the washer!! Love, love, love this product I can only hope it withstands the test of time!!",2
Linda F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Floor cleaner,the United States,14-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Out of everything I have ever bought this is the holy grail. I have hardwood floors. I dont have my carpet in the one room yet but will. This sweeps and scrubs at the same time. Saves me so much. Now we have 3 dogs 2 shed I do sweep it up as much as I can before I do use it. But I still get dog hair. After it seems to be gone. It is the best. I put hot water in the tray and turn it on to clean it. I find that if I put the handle down the bar turns and cleans better. The top comes off easily and the bar lifts right out and I can wash it or change it to the carpet one it one of the throw rugs need cleaning. But it leaves my hard wood floors almost dry. They look so good when I use it. When it rains and the dogs go out the doggie door and come back in with muddy paws just use it and all cleaned up. Best thing I own to clean with. Save time and my back.,
Errbearr,3.0 out of 5 stars,Stained my rug,the United States,27-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It seemed to work OKAY on tile but I expected it to suction a lot more water up. It didn’t work evenly on my tile so I found myself having to go at it at all different angles. I removed the roller and rinsed it well before using on my area rug but it left several black marks on the rug and seemed to make the stains worse than they were so I had to throw the rug out. I immediately returned it. My sister has faux wood flooring and it works well in her home and she has never reported any of the issues I had. Maybe it was user error but in my case a steam mop works much better.,
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,3 Stars,the United States,7-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I bought this and the first few times I used it I was convinced that it was a gift from the gods. The maneuverability isn't the best but it works. The mop/vacuuming is great if whatever needs mopped is not stuck on. (example bird poop) My only issue with this is that it gets clogged quite easily. There should have been a tool used to clean the tube from the suction part to the container where the mess goes. I think that the design for this needs to be readdressed. I don't think that it was worth the price but I also have not tried other wet/dry vacuums.,
S. S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I'd saved my money.,the United States,20-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I could have bought a lot of Swiffer's (both wet and dry) with what I paid for this machine and probably have had the same result.  When I bought this, I was having a lazy moment ( or two) and wanted something that I thought would make the chore of cleaning my floors, easier.  I have three dogs that are constantly tracking in dirt.  But it didn't. I didn't save myself any time, OR money by buying this.  The amount of time needed to prepare it, then clean it up afterward AND the amount of money needed to buy all the cleaner, rollers, and filters, didn't really justify my getting it.  Using my own vacuum, some elbow grease and the wet and dry cleaning clothes did just as well.",
Gotham.Batbaby,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really disappointed,the United States,14-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was excited to unbox mine today, but the first use shows it will not work for me. It cleaned up muddy footprints, but dirt that had dried on the floor would NOT come up. I sat on it for a minute and it was like I hadn’t touched it. I like that it had a tray to sit on and I could keep it to clean up the immediate mud, but I don’t see the point in a cleaner that can’t pick up a dried dirt spot in the floor. My floors are white, porcelain tile. I even was able to move it side-to-side over the dirt spot as well as back and forth and it just wouldn’t touch it. Multiple spots on the floor. Do not recommend.",
Daniel Leng,1.0 out of 5 stars,It Truly Sucks! Don't get sucked in.,the United States,26-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love the idea of this invention, as I'm one of those people who always says ""I'll mop right after I vacuum"", then I never do it because, well, I never really feel like busting out the mop and bucket after vacuuming. This machine seemed like the perfect solution for me.I'll start with the one good thing... the mopping worked really well for me when I used it. The floors were spotless after mopping with this thing. Pretty awesome.That said, the device is almost unusable as a whole because the vacuum is terrible. It has the worst suction power of any vacuum I've experienced in my 43 years on this planet. The dust chamber fills up super fast, making the suction even worse. I had to empty it after 5 minutes of vacuuming.On top of that, it's super hard to maneuver. It feels like you need to make a 10 point turn to get anywhere, a bit like you're driving a car where the front tires don't actually turn.Finally, after about 2 months, it just stopped working. I turn it on and it runs for a few seconds and shuts down, with a burning smell. I've contacted Bissell to see if I can get a refund. This has been a truly horrible experience.",
Vivian,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT!,the United States,28-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Once I figured out the proper amount of cleaner to use, I knew I had a winner with this.  I can't use the Bissell cleaner that came with the Crosswave as I am sensitive to smell, so I used a natural cleaner concentrate.  The first time I used my new Crosswave, I followed the directions for the amount of cleaning solution which was WAY TOO MUCH.  I had foam like crazy!  I rinsed all the soap out of the roller as well as the reservoir and went over the floor with clear water.  A few days later I used the Crosswave again only this time I used a tsp of my cleaner concentrate to the highest amount line for the water.  WOW did it do a great job!  I was shocked at how dirty the water in the reservoir was and so impressed with how clean my floors are.  I bought the Crosswave Pet Pro as we have dogs and cats.  This is a great product and well worth the money.",
Chris O,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great tool,the United States,1-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Purchased this bissell machine to clean my tile floors. I have that wood look tile throughout the house.  I was using a steam mop but it didn't seem to clean the grout. Then I switched to one of the more powerful steam cleaners.  Even that didn't work on the grout.  Plus I was left with soppy floors and had to go over the floors with a sponge mop to soak up the water. Then I saw this machine.  I've had it over 6 months now and it works great. I have two puppies so naturally I have two too many puppy accidents all over the floor.  No problem with this machine.  I use the Bissell soap for Pets that comes with the machine. But I started using just plain water and a capful or so of bleach. I feel this bleach solution cleans the floors and disinfects them at the same time.  I highly recommend this product.Update -  After 6 months it sounds like the motor is on the blink.  Emits loud squeaking noises. Will ask for a refund,One
Diana,5.0 out of 5 stars,a nice surprise,the United States,20-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've only used it twice, but both times very happy with how much dirt it cleaned up. the water was really dark brown. both clean and dirty water tanks lasted longer than i thought it would. there were a couple of hardened spills that had to be dealt with by hand, but the rest of the very dirty floor was effortless. as easy as vacuuming. it did an adequate job of leaving the floor damp but dried quickly. clean up wasn't bad. the self cleaning does a pretty good job of cleaning the parts of the machine not easily accessible. The dirty water tank was a quick rinse and throwing out the dog hair. I have 2 indoor/outdoor cats and a dog. I hope this continues to work well because now I can't imagine going back to a mop.",
A.F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best Invention Ever!,the United States,11-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Big Fan of Bissell.  Moved to Florida and our entire house has ceramic tile.  I am old school but didn't want to wash all these tiles on my hands and knees, ha ha ha.  It was so easy to use, easy to clean when done, and it REALLY cleaned the tiles.  No more mop and bucket or hands and knees.This product was certainly well worth the cost in time savings, effort,  and a job well done.",One
Almir Cutic,5.0 out of 5 stars,MY NEW FAVORITE THING,the United States,8-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I came here to write how much I love this! I have dogs, fish, turtles and many reptiles and this thing is AMAZING. I’ve bought several types of floor cleaners over the years including rug doctor and this thing is AMAZING. It doesn’t leave as much water on the floor as other models, and scrubs much better! It’s SO light and maneuverable! I have back problems so even a little weight is hard for me to manage, but this thing is nimble! And it’s small enough to fit right under cupboards and under the edges of furniture. It also uses surprisingly little water. I saw the small water reservoir and thought I’d be constantly refilling it, but I did three rooms and a hallways before I needed to. PLUS the self-clean function at the end is awesome. My husband and I are jockeying to be the one to get to use it because it’s so pleasant. It also did a decent job on the carpet in the closet! I LOVE THIS THING.",
CBD,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't consider buying this vacuum,the United States,23-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Have been trying to like this for a long time. When it works, which is seldom, it is great. However, 90% of the time it will only vacuum a spot about 18""x18"" before it cuts off due to a full tank alarm. When that happens you might as well clean the tank and filter holder and put them up to dry for a couple of days. Bissell sent a replacement filter/lid which allows you to vacuum until the unit shuts off, empty the tank and continue to vacuum with the second lid .... until the alarm shuts it off again.Had the corded version and wish that I had never considered the cordless unit.",
Holly Heath Gallagher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect machine for garage floor (and probably other things too),the United States,17-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"A friend raved about this machine. I got it and used it to clean a three car garage for the first time in 8 years. The garage has one of those coatings, so I wasn’t cleaning bare cement. But it was Soooooo satisfying to watch the floor go from utterly disgusting to clean and sparkly in one or two passes. Not going to lie to you, I had to empty the bin and add more cleaner several times, but I can’t imagine how long it would have taken with a mop. You don’t have to use the Bissell cleaner, although it worked very well in our garage.",
Michelle,4.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe I should clean more often?,the United States,27-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"No one loves clean wood floors more than me. I have 2 shark steamers that have never let me down, but I was looking for something different. I liked the idea of not having to vacuum before cleaning the floors!! You're probably thinking we have 12 kids and 4 dogs, but there are only 2 adults and 1 big dog in this house. Again, love clean floors. Also, ant anxiety. Having a dog means water spots after drinking and messy paws...especially in the winter. Then you have the usual dirty shoes from walks and everyday life. We're new homeowners so I'm constantly working on something and put cleaning the floors on low priority...just as long as I vacuumed. I took before and after photos and noticed that my floor didn't look completely clean. Water spot damage? Maybe. Or was it because the steamer wasn't used? Maybe. Would the floor look clean after my 'signature vinegar hands and knees' floor scrubbing? Possibly. This floor cleaner/vacuum is helpful. A tad time consuming if you're like me, but I wouldn't recommend it for DEEP cleaning. It's easy enough to use it for everyday/common cleaning so I think I will use it for that. Am I happy with it? Yes. Maybe we're just extra dirty and this Bissell can't handle it all. I'm ok with that.",One
Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves floors clean and house smells fresh,the United States,21-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Great for dog hair! I love that I dont have to sweep the floor before mopping and can do it at at once. I also love how quickly the floor dries. However I would say that the self cleaning it shows is a little misleading...it can be a chore to take everything apart when you're done to clean so I recomend buying a few extra rollers and filters so you can switch them out if you dont feel like cleaning them right away. I found some reasonably priced off brand ones compatible with this machine on here and I also love the cleaner with febreze.  If you have dogs this is a must have for keeping your area rugs free of that dog smell and cleaning up dog hair,
Cortney B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Melts Instantly!,the United States,31-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"What a piece of junk! We had ours 2 weeks before we smelled a funny smell and it stopped working. Took it to the repair shop as advised by customer service and they issued us a replacement unit. We only used the new unit one time for no more than 3 minutes and I smelled the burning again. I stopped and took the brush off to find it had been melted by the motor! What the heck! I have included a picture of the brush and the melted brush next to the unused brush to show the difference. We are livid because we are passed the return window because we took it to the repair shop - so we are out $300!On a side note, before the first one broke we loved it.

Kathy Badger,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy,the United States,26-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This product has not worked on my floors.

Shawn Troxtel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Most accurate review you’re going to find,the United States,24-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I live in Washington in the country on farm land with a pond. I have 3 dogs (two labs and a golden retriever) 3 cats so lots of hair. I debated on getting the max, thankful I didn’t for it takes me more the the 30min charge to do my 1500 sq ft house. The day I got it i was pumped under the impression I can sweep and mop at the same time!!! WRONG. It clogged and left streaks on my wood floors. Mind you I sweep and mop every other day. I found what works best, vacuum first with it, make sure you empty it multiple times or it will clog, then use the mop part to spot clean or do a quick clean up then if you need a deep clean, grab your old mop and mop after. Also make sure you clean this vacuum every time or it will make it less effective. Takes me about 15 mins to get it all clean each time. If I lived in the city with less dogs this would make a great vacuum but I don’t I live with farm animals and dogs who love to be outside.",One
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save ur money!!,the United States,6-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The product starting leaking puddles of water when it was in the recline position and machine wouldn’t suck the water back up that was dumped all over floor. When I called customer service they advised me to drive it 45 minutes to the nearest repair shop. After I contested the answer saying I have three children under 4 to take along with me to take their broken product 45 minutes away was not very convenient, they apologized but didn’t offer any other option.  So three weeks went by and I never had the opportunity to take the machine and I grew more frustrated that I had to do all the work to get the machine fixed and I called back again. At that point they said they would send a new machine this one time. I was very thankful for that. Fast forward three months later and less than a dozen uses (and I clean the Machine every use according to Instructions) and once again, puddles of water are being dumped all over floor. Very disappointed!!  Not made very well!  For $300, it shouldn’t have so many defects. I’m so angry I wasted this money!!!",2
Joseph My Castle,5.0 out of 5 stars,A BAD DUDE!,the United States,12-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I really keep my floors clean... or I thought I did. I do have 2 indoor cats and 2 kids. I have all tile and hard wood downstairs, and several rugs here and there. I got this and was so excited to not have to ""mop"" again. Let me tell you.. the GROSS stuff this dude picked up was crazy!  I was so impressed how it can go from hard floors to a rug easily. I was impressed on how many parts come apart for cleaning. I loved seeing the gross water when I poured it out, knowing my floors are now SUPER clean. It puts vacuuming and mopping all in one single step.  And the solution smells so great!. I love this thing. I highly recommended it in my last zoom call with all my co-workers, esp the ones with indoor pets.",
Homeward,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a solution for my laminate floors,the United States,15-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Mom of three little little kids. Every meal turns into an art project. Plus my husband woodworks in the garage. Picture pieces of banana and sawdust and dog hair all stuck on my floors and into my area rugs.  Every time I wanted presentable floors I had to take TWO hours to sweep, vaccum, and mop. And I still wasn't happy because it looked hazy and dirty.  This thing is a game-changer.  Clean floors immediately.  Thank you to whoever designed this. You knew to make all the parts come apart so we could clean them and get the inevitable hair tie and shoelace out with ease.  My only wish is that you had some sort of a handheld version like dust buster for quick spills that runs on batteries. Maybe you do?",
LCL,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy I bought this!,the United States,27-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have wood and tile in our house and we used to get by with sweeping and steam mopping every now and then. Then we got a basset hound and OMG! the amount of hair and slobber that is constantly on my floors is overwhelming. First I bought a Bissell Cordless Vacuum and that was great for getting the hair off of the floor and easy to do every day. But it did nothing for the slobber all over the floor. I looked at a few options but decided to try this since it also functioned like a vacuum, had separate dirty and clean water bins (most options use a pad that need to be changed or rinsed)  and would work on our area rugs. I hesitated b/c of the price. BUT IM SO HAPPY I GOT IT. It works just as promised. My floors look great and it works well on the area rugs too. It is not a deep cleaner but more effective than a regular vacuum.  The first time I used it, I did have some streaking. But after a few more uses I got the hang of it - you have to use fluid for a bit and then go over the same area without fluid.  The clean up is pretty easy too.  Much easier than using a mop and bucket.  I still use the regular vacuum in between using the crosswave.",
MissCole86,5.0 out of 5 stars,Needed to deep clean new home,the United States,17-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Recently we purchased a new home that has LVT flooring. Beautiful.  But even only being a 3yr old home the previous owners were dirty (imagine walking on the floor after I had it professionally cleaned and your bare feet where still dirty). After purchasing and meticulously washing the floors 2-3times we could happily run around barefoot and feel clean! Wonderful device! Definitely get the soap that accompanies it, all well worth the money!Ohh we have two big dogs and this picks up the pet hair without any issue or tangle.",
Jenny,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Cleaner,the United States,15-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this because I have been through 3 Hoover Floor Mates and something always breaks.  This is a decent cleaner, but it definitely takes more passes than the hoover to get up something that has been spilled and dried.The best part of this however, is how easy it is to clean everything when you are finished.  I think that was part of why I kept losing Floor Mates.  It was very difficult to thoroughly clean the dirty water container of the Floor Mate, but kudos to Bissel, this looks brand new after each use.  I live in the middle of the woods, so twigs/pine needles etc. are always getting dragged in and would get stuck in the various areas of the Floor Mate's collection tank.  This comes apart easily and you can rinse every inch of it.It's very lightweight and the smallish head on it makes it easy to maneuver around furniture and even the sides of the toilet and sinks in the bathroom.I haven't tried it on my area rugs yet, but I think for light cleaning it would definitely work well.",
Belva Joann Ortiz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Loved at first,the United States,3-Nov-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Had for nearly a year and have loved it! That was up until it just wont turn on now. Used once a week and cleaned after each use and deep cleaned filter and brush monthly. The only issue i had prior to this was streaks which was fine because a quick mop with a tradition mop worked great and allowed me to add smelly good to it. I have unplugged and checked everything but still can not get it to power on. No strange sounds or anything. Just not working. Even tried a difderent outlet because i have a older house with bad wiring.,
cch1950,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,18-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Received the Crosswave  Pet Pro on Monday and unpacked it and got it set up.  Super easy.  No tools or assistance required.  Used it this morning in my kitchen and hall which are golden oak and the primary reason I bought this.  Worked perfectly.  Generally vacuum my floors before washing but I really wanted to check out the vacuum function of this machine.  Sucked up all of the dog hair, dust and various crumbs which had accumulated.I had no streaking problem, as a matter of fact, none of the problems complained about in other reviews.  This afternoon we will attack the tile bathroom floors.I might even try it out on the entry hall rug.I would definitely recommend this machine.  I see it as a real time saver.",
Nick,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am now a believer !,the United States,12-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was not a believer before I used this item. I read all reviews and gave this a shot. I am glad I did!! Well worth the money. Beats sweeping first then steaming and then polishing. All that took me 3hrs or longer. I have 3 kids and this item did it all with one item. Not 3 or 2 separate items. Only 1 !! Worked great. Any surface. Just go. No issues except that the water holder for the dirty water is so small. I had to dump it several times. Wish it held more. Also the water cup for the holding / cleaning try is way small also. A bit in the pain in the butt. Besides that, only good things to say. One last thing. I'm a clean freak! I believed my floors were spotless. Turns out I was way wrong! I got 4 full dirty tanks full of nasty stuff off my floor. I couldn't believe the water was black!!! I clean my floors all the time and thought they were so clean. This item works extremely well and now I believe this is close to they best cleaner out on the market today. If not it's tied with other items. Not to many other probably even come close to this. It's really a great product!👌👌👍👍🤘🤘",One
Colby T.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the buy!,the United States,21-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I never review items, but decided to review this since it can be pricey. Great machine. Suction is great, so the floor does dry quickly. Super easy to handle and move, glides across the floor great. I don't have pets but I have kids which leave bigger messes. Larger items like coco cereal, and other items kids think look good on floors, you cannot vacuum up. So in a sense you do have to do a small sweep for larger items. All else is fair game, even my long hair. No issues what so ever. Their multi surface cleaner smells GREAT! It brought my son from his room to see what smelled so great! If anything is stuck I would suggest, scuffing to loosen prior to using crosswave, otherwise it won't get much stuck on floor. Tank is slightly small too,, so you may have to empty a few times.. Easy to take apart and clean.. All in all great daily cleaner, for deep clean I would use this to start, I feel it stoll requires a little pre work to be considered a great deep cleaner.",One
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Register for your warranty with the Manufacturer!!,the United States,24-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,The product worked great for 3 months and then it died with no warning. I called bissell with the number provided by amazon and they were able to help me troubleshoot and it was ultimately decided that it would need to go to a service center but there is not one within 30 miles of me so they had to send me a new machine. DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS OTHER THAN BISSELL CLEANER or it will void your warranty. They have 3 year manufacturer warranty so that's good. Also the cleaning tray is useless.. doesn't do much to help clean because the tray itself gets nasty. I was impressed by how easy it was to clean my floors with no other tools. It is a great product but it seems to have a short life.. Warranty is a must.,One
KM Gordon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for tile floors,the United States,26-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have a golden retriever.  He sheds - a lot!  And drools continuously any time there is food involved.  In case you didn't know, drool attracts dirt like a magnet.  I was using a steam mop, but I had to bend over and hit all of the drool marks with a scrub pad and a cleaning solution to get them to come up.  Two passes on those areas, and they were all gone.  In all honesty, I vacuumed first with a regular vacuum cleaner.  His fur is long and I didn't want it clogging the machine before I even got started.  My house is mostly tile in the living areas, so probably over 1200 square feet of tile.  I had to move the cord 3 times, and each time coincided with the tank needing to be changed out.I have two minor complaints about the machine.  The first is that it doesn't get close enough to the baseboards.  Leaves about .5"" of uncleaned area next to them, which in El Paso near the doors is quite obvious.  Will have to hit those areas by hand I suppose.  The second is that when you turn it off and click it into upright position, it leaves a little puddle of dirty water.",
Diane,2.0 out of 5 stars,Big disappointment!,the United States,23-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This machine is very maneuverable and has pretty good suction, but it leaves the floors streaky and dirty!  The delivery of the solution is uneven and the roller just seems to spread the dirt around after the first 100 square feet or so.  The only way to clean the floors with this is to constantly take it apart and clean the roller.  Big waste of time and effort.  Better to sweep or vacuum and mop manually.",2
Michelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not meet expectations,the United States,14-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It doesn't suck up the water that good. The maneuverability isn't the best. If you need to go under a chair it will lift off the floor so you will not be able to go all the way under the chair without moving it. It cleans good overall. You must clean the vacuum thoroughly after every use, if not it will smell the next time you use it, and leading to you having to purchase a new filter. They should have put a different button for the cleaning and for the vacuum. The water button is too close so if your hands are too big you can make a mistake and press it. If you don't mind cleaning the machine, after you have finished cleaning its fine.",
T. V. Davis,3.0 out of 5 stars,Four for the cleaning; two for the design issues,the United States,14-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Had the device a week and used it on wood floors, two area rugs, and vinyl flooring. Device did a decent job cleaning all surfaces, but if you aren’t the kind to clean your floors at least every few days, and you have pets, small children, or a sloppy housemate, this isn’t going to do a great job on built-up grime & dried spots of goo, even on the (more powerful) ‘area rug’ setting. However, I find that, due to the way you have to CAREFULLY open and close the bottom casing that holds the cleaning brush roll to switch out the brush heads (especially if you’re dealing with a lot of short dog hair), you run a high risk of breaking or bending the clear tabs on either side that hold the cover in place!Long story short: I’ve already severely bent one tab by not lining it up perfectly. Shame, as it is great to not have to separately vacuum and mop the floors.If you get it, be patient and VERY careful when placing the cover back on. If you are older, not a fan of bending down a lot, have sight issues, or have mobility issues, I’d pass on this one.",
K. Lischke,1.0 out of 5 stars,Works great...once. Then never again.,the United States,3-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"When the unit was pristine from the factory, it worked really well. But even a moderate amount of usage gummed up the inside completely. The experience of cleaning out the accessible parts was disgusting, but trying to address the joint where the two parts of the vacuum join up was another level of yuck. Something about the wet/dry function and the design of this product forms a plug that blocks the material you're trying to clean from making it into the reservoir that should be collecting that material so you can dispose of it when it gets full. This part isn't easily accessible, but has gummed up each of the four times I've attempted to use this thing. I end up with cat hair and detritus everywhere, making things grosser than they were before I tried to vacuum. Just a horrible, flawed design. Please don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.",
Epoc20,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greatest investment for my floors.,the United States,3-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Easy to use way more effective then mop or a swifter ( I feel like they leave the floor sticky). Cleans up the floor with out prepping the floor by sweeping. I do sweep up bigger amounts of dirt. Sucks up the dirt as it cleans. 3 kids under 10, 2 dogs and 3 cats. All of them in and out my floors get pretty dirty especially when it rains we have more dirt then grass. Leaves my floors feeling cleaner thenbi have ever managed. In the photos above I added a huge mess the kids made with cups of ramen within minutes. Did not sweep, just started up I usually leave water in it since we have messes on the daily. I use it on my area rug after I vacuum only because the hairs collect on the rug. I did use it with out vacuuming but I do prefer to vacuum first. They flooded the toliet and water was all over the floor used it to suck up the water and then used it to clean the floor. Best investment for my floors so far. Super easy to fill and dump and clean. I only choose a 3 star for deep cleaning because it's not made to deep clean rugs but does a fantastic job for top cleaning. Easy enough to use we dont have to do a deep clean. I clean the whole house floor every other day and dont feel like it's a drag of a task.",
Emily E. G.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good Until it Broke,the United States,3-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I had this for one use before it broke. During that time it was great. The issue was that there are only two settings hardwood and rug well right at the end of my first use I switched to rug and the product won't switch back into the lower mode. Probably is that means it outputs too much water as well now so it's not able to be used for floors. Customer service was not good. I called immediately to try to remedy and the only offer was to ship a new handle....the handle pops in ONCE there is not option to take it apart therefore no remedy for the issue.Before all that I will say it was sucking great and also when you let go of the handle the suction really helps to dry up the floor in the second swipe. It could have better wheels for steering it's difficult to turn and basically only wants to go directly back and forth.,2
D,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing ever!,the United States,11-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I think this may be the best thing ever. I first started out with a Hoover floor mate 15 years ago. I loved it in my first house because it was a small house so it didn’t take much time. When we moved it took too long to clean the area I had. I eventually switched to a scrub brush and bucket and a shop vac To suck up the dirty water. While this does a great job it is a pain having to move all that gear around the house and clean up after is also time consuming. I just got the cross wave in last week and I love it. As you can tell above I am picky about how I clean my floors and I am so happy with this. It was very quick and easy to use and left the floors almost completely dry after one pass. I would and will recommend this to everyone.,One

I really tried.  I've used it several times on my porcelain floor in the kitchen, bar and dining area.  It leaves absolutely the worst streaks ever.  The roller gets dirty almost instantly and then just seems to roll the dirt right off onto the floor again.  I had such high hopes.  My floor is HUGE and I thought this would be so much easier than sweeping, then mopping.  It's NOT.  At this point I stare at it as it sits in a corner and I wonder what the heck I'm going to do with it.  It was SO much money and it turns out I can sweep and/or vacuum my floors in less time and then Swiffer them and get it so much cleaner.  What a pain and a disappointment.",One

Theyre collective filthiness is no match for my soulmate of a vacuum.Our floors are a mix of wood, cheap laminate and one area rug. It doesn't leave them wet and sucks up dirt I didn't even know was there! My only complaint is that it doesn't get right up on to edges very well but the quality of what it can reach makes up for that.It does not shampoo carpets, I will still have to shampoo every once in a while but it does help them more than a regular vacuum.I.

Bourgeois,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of Problems,the United States,20-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Where to begin? This machine does not include a sturdy scrub roller for hard floors. Only a soft one to clean carpet.  Suction is mediocre at best. It sprays and suctions at the same time, denying you the ability to spray and leave the cleaner on the floor for a time to soften up the dirt. It's fine if you have low traffic and a fairly clean floor, but I have dogs that bring in dirt by the bucket load.  I need a machine that SCRUBS hard floors but can't find one. Also, it does not do edges at all.",

The Bissell crossway is easy to use, the quality of cleaning all of our different floor surface, e.g. carpet, vinyl and laminate is very good, the fresh clean scent of the solution is quite nice and, the ease of cleaning our machine between uses makes it a 5 star appliance in our home.

It's lightweight, gets into most corners, you will need to take a broom under lower furniture so I sweep under that and the cleaner picks all that up when it cleans the floor.

RB,3.0 out of 5 stars,Really difficult to clean,the United States,13-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"With two dogs, was really looking forward to a product that could go from floor/rugs. It definitely works going from floor/carpet and neither is left too wet. However, it won’t deep clean your rugs like a comercial carpet cleaner you would rent. It’s a good “in between” cleanings solution. The major setback is cleaning the vacuum- which needs to be done after every cleaning. The unit comes apart, but fur sticks to the filter/screen and plastic bin. It takes a bit of time to clean properly.",One

Melissa Ecret,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,the United States,10-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought the crosswave pet pro because I needed something that would be able to keep up with my labrador retriever's shedding and after the first use I realized it wasn't really picking up the dog hair it just got wet and pushed it around. So then I started sweeping before using it (which defeats the point of the machine) and it was still pushing around what little dog hair was left. I still kept using it because it was **$300** except about a month ago when it completely lost suction. It picks up no water and my floors end up just wet with dirty water and wet hair. I have cleaned every part and every piece of the machine by hand multiple times, let them dry before reassembling, and still no change. I am very disappointed to say the least, it is nothing more than an $80 mop at best. I will not be recommending this machine to any friends or family, or actually anyone.

We have two large dogs and three kids, so keeping up with the floors is my biggest challenge.On day one, I LOVED this. My floors looked great, my house smelled fresh and clean, and I had peace of mind dumping all that nasty sludge water and knowing it wasn’t on my floors any longer. On day two when I took it out to do another area of the house, I noticed a slight odor, but didn’t think much of it. It’s now day 14, and the odor is so bad every time I turn it on that the product is unusable. I’ve washed everything according to the directions twice, with no relief from the awful smell. As is, this product is unusable.I called Bissell today, but wasn’t able to stay on hold. I’ll reach out again tonight to see if they have a solution and will update here. I’m really hopeful they’ll have an answer, because this has the potential to be the most efficient and impactful cleaning product in my home.",2

It takes me less time to vacuum the floor and then mop it than it does to use this. If you have stuck on grime you have to spend much more time treating the area than if you just had a mop.  I was hoping to have something I could grab quickly to clean up my toddlers messes but that doesn't work either because you need to clean it out each time and cannot just leave it wet with the solution or it stinks terribly.

This thing does a great job of sucking up all her hair and keeps on cleaning. I hated using a traditional mop, because no matter how much I swept the house before hand, there was always hair left on the floor and it would get the mop all nasty. This thing makes cleaning the brushes very easy and the dog hair goes right into the tank and gets pulled out by the strainer. I'd say it could be a little bit easier to clean the tank out, but with how much easier it makes keeping my house clean I don't mind.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,light and swift,the United States,23-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I previously owned  a floormate which i loved.

So I decided to give it a try.In comparison, I like both, I think the floormate scrubbed a little harder on dried caked stuff on the floor, but I like the end product of this new one more.  It was lighter to push around and the tiles didn't have watermarks as with the floormate.  So even though from time to time I have to get down and scrub something off the floor, I like this wet dry vacuum better.

I’ve gotten a Lot of clogs toward the bottom of the vacuum. I have one cat in a 2700sqft home. No dogs inside.. I wouldn’t be able to use this on actual dog hair, no way. I’m thoroughly disappointed.

Sara Bronson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t Look Back,the United States,15-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This thing is amazing. Seriously, don’t second guess buying it. As someone who is overly fed up with traditional mops, this is such a life saver. It is much quicker, uses FAR less water AND solution, and keeps dirty and clean water separate. It is able to keep up with my cat’s fur, my hair, and my mechanic husband’s mess from working. A bottle of Bissell solution runs right around $10, but you are going to get probably 20-30 cleanings out of the bottle. This machine is going to put for itself, as we frequently changes mop heads and, for that matter, mops. It saves so much water that if you are interested in something sustainable, this is absolutely the way to go.",

If it seems like the floor cleaner isn't spraying evenly then stop and clean the roller bar.  I also learned the vacuum can dry the mopped areas.  Don't press the spray button and go over the area again, the vacuum will dry the wet area.

For hard surfaces in the house its great. We use  it on the kitchen and entries daily instead of a broom and mop. It is faster, leaves the floor cleaner and looks better when finished.  The only negative I can think of is that it is a little noisy when running. The motor is louder than a standard vacuum when running. Well worth the tradeoff when you consider all the positives. I highly recommend this  unit if you have hard floors in high traffic areas of your home and want them clean without pulling out the broom, mop and bucket.",
Shawn,4.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient but...,the United States,22-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,The Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro all in one wet/dry vacuum is okay. It cleaned floors as it says in its deliverables and the suction power is pretty good. Take warning that it is very loud. It also takes a lot of liquid. I found it semi difficult to clean a hallway runner rug. It did a descent job on the hardwood floors. It did not takeoff some spots that were dried on and I ended up having to scratch it off the floor and then go over it with the vacuum. You definitely have to clean it out after each use or the gunk will get stuck on it. Cleaning it after each use was very simple in terms of taking it apart and putting the parts back together. Overall the product is not bad.,3

Both upstairs and downstairs floors of the house are all hardwood floors with area rugs in certain areas (except a marble entry). Dry and wet/ dry use is a mess. Cleaning after use is a mess.

It’s great for cleaning hard floors and I was very surprised to see how well it also works on carpet.  It’s easy to use and requires very little effort.

Richard E. Fischer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine - for about 20-30 minutes,the United States,21-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We were delighted with the performance and ease of use of this machine, which we purchased following glowing recommendations from a family member. Easy to put together, clear instructions, and worked great on a tile floor. However, after about 30 minutes of use, it developed a loud grinding noise, and suction ceased. We cleaned the filter, removed and replaced the brush, but to no avail. The noise sounds like an internal gear has stripped. Fortunately, we bought this from Amazon, so no BS with the return process, although the handle, once installed, cannot be removed to get it to fit into the original box.  We're going to try a replacement before abandoning this device.  But a very poor initial experience.  If something similar happens with the replacement, we'll give up on it.",

I have 3 dogs (one extremely fluffy and shedding) and hardwood floors with a big area rug in the living room and bedroom. Also, I’m pregnant, so cleaning is the last thing I want to do. When I do clean, my routine is to go around the whole house with my heavy vacuum then follow up with my swifter. Swifters are great...if you are in college and don’t mind leaving dirt and grime in the grooves and texture of your flooring. My floors were never looking clean. I finally had enough when I was on my hands and knees scrubbing my kitchen floor like little orphan Annie. After I saw the dramatic difference between swiftering and scrubbing with my hands, I hopped on Amazon and ordered the Crosswave. When it normally takes 2 hrs to clean my house, it took me 45 minutes to both vacuum and mop with this thing. My house doesn’t even smell doggy anymore! Also, cleaning this product is extremely easy and stupid proof on putting it back together, even my pregnancy brain can handle it. Seriously. Treat yourself to this product. But it for your mom, your brother, your enemies. All houses and apartments should come with one of these bad boys. My vacuum and carpet shampooer now vacate in the basement.",
Lori Simpson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life?,the United States,10-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This thing is amazing! A total back-saver. I really thought it was going to be a hassle or not work as good as it claimed, but I'm very pleased with it. We have old painted floors that are just plywood (very uneven surface) and the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro did a wonderful job of cleaning them up. They look and feel cleaner under our feet, and smell nice. The real joy for me is in not throwing my back out every time I have to mop the floor- this machine requires the same motion as vacuuming, which doesn't trigger my back problems at all. Oh, and finally a nice long cord! I absolutely love it and I'm so glad I bought it :)",One
Nic,1.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I would have never bought this!,the United States,4-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I tried I really tried with this vacuum. I’ve had it for about 6/7 months but have only used it 4 times. Welp today it burned out on me. I’m not sure why. Do yourself a favor and save your money! It leaves your hardwood floors streaky and wet. It won’t pick up even the smallest crumb from an area rug and puts out way to much water that the area rug will dry and leave ripples. I cleaned it properly swapped out the rollers and everything and still works horribly. The maintenance alone is annoying.,One
Kate Paul,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell,the United States,6-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Pros-My goodness my tile is clean and it shines.-great for deep cleaning-sucks up everythingCons-It’s heavier than I imagined it would be.Maneuvering-for me it depends on what I’m cleaning.  My ceramic tile - it’s a haul across the floor.  My laminate upstairs - the Bissell is easier to maneuver but again after awhile the machine gets heavy.  My brown laminate like to streak but white laminate it doesn’t.  Still working on that.,

Key is to go slow. Easy to operate, easy to clean, easy to store, and easy to get up and down the stairs. Amazon had a great deal Last week, I think it went up again,, but, it is a  must have for Pets and kids. I cleaned a area rug that the litter box is on that looked decent nothing major but the stuff it got off of it was crazy!!!  Again there is a neat tool that brings out all the gunk and you just  throw it out. Not having to vacuum before mopping is great too. Love this thing!",
John,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great Concept But Would Not Purchase Again,the United States,21-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If given the chance I would not order this vacuum again. The 2nd time I used this vacuum it smelled musty, and it spread the musty smell all over the floors.  We followed the directions of how to take care of it after use. The vacuum is stowed in the closet and stinks.The vacuum also leaves behind a “mud”. When I was using it, it would leave behind lines of wet dirt and almost like a wet lent like substance.It does not clean up spots like dried on the floor food. I would have to pass over the spot many times to get it clean.",
Jacob Wright,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work with pets,the United States,14-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have 3 dogs, two of which shed a lot. I was getting sick of having to sweep/mop up their hair almost every single day and clean our hardwood floors when they would run inside with dirty paws, so we decided to get something that may alleviate some time, but we were highly disappointed. It definitely is not good for vacuuming/mopping. It does not get all the dog hair, hair gets stuck in the bristles and you're spending a lot of time just cleaning those out, and the end results just look like we spread hair over a wet floor. You are MUCH better off just sticking to the old fashioned sweeping and mopping. Don't waste your money, honestly.",One
Jane Maule,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not pick up tiny bits of leaves,the United States,7-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Maneuverablilty is great and that is the best part of this vacuum.  Have a short hair cat and clean regularly, brush cat every day.  This vacuum picks up dust but redeposits little tiny clumps of hair.  When you turn it off it leaves an 8 inch line of debris.  I vacuum for a half hour and empty the container but that does not help.  I have mostly hardwood floor with one 8x6 area rug.  Really disappointed in this appliance.  Going back to my Oreck.",
Snowflake,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.5 stars really,the United States,23-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I am both amazed and appalled at the amount of dirt this thing can pull up. The first time I used it I was rather concerned that I would have difficulty but it was surprisingly easy to put together and learn to use. I clean it very well each time I use it. Frankly it does require a lot of cleaning in between uses but it does such a good job on the floors that I don’t care. The only complaint I have is that one of the rollers broke inside of the unit and I had to purchase a new one. It’s a good thing this item comes with two rollers so that I could use the other one while I waited for a replacement. I do recommend keeping more rollers on hand in case that happens again,One
Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,The cleaner cleaner,the United States,9-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We just swept and mopped yesterday... We have 2 fur babies and 3 kids and this was today's results. We live in Florida where we have some of the dustiest dirt and muddiest mud. The cleaning solution smells amazing. Pretty sure this cleans much better than the broom and mop and saves your back in the process. It was a little bit more difficult to clean a spot where there was a drop of mud that dried, but otherwise pretty impressive... could be also just be part of the honeymoon phase with an expensive purchase. I already registered the product for future discounts and to be able to get the most out of our product. READ THE DIRECTIONS FOR EVERYTHING.",One
Sports Mom,4.0 out of 5 stars,worked great on laminate,the United States,9-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Pretty excited about this bad boy! I have been using a swiffer on my laminate flooring.  This little guy worked like a champ! I live in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma surrounded by pastures and wheat fields, so dirt is a constant. Plus my 2 year old long haired GSD. This made short order of dirt, paw prints, hair and leftover food that apparently my teenage son inadvertently drops!  I think I may be in LOVE 😍!The return/dirt/mud/hair was a little nasty to dump, but hey that means it did its job! My floors look great! It doesn't leave that glossy, slick shine, but I don't care for that look anyway. They just look clean!The water trail left by it was actually less then my swiffer wet!

I have a bad back and going over with sweeping and mopping takes a toll on me. Using this machine was fun, I did not expect all the gunk at the end. I have 2 dogs and a cat. I do keep up with my floors and I was expecting someone with dirty water but was not at all prepared for the fistful of gunk that was on the filter, pet hair galore.

Eric Kaun,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced and awkward,the United States,5-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"A good amount of power, but cleaning and prepping this for use are somewhat aggravating. And the manual doesn't really help with what should be standard procedure:1. dry-vac the entire area, resisting the urge to pull the trigger for cleaning fluid2. spot-clean areas with the liquid - if a clump of hair appears (we have hairy pets), dry-vac it3. finally, wet-vac the entire area as a once-overAlso, you really need to keep the thing clear of hair clumps. There are a lot of nooks and crannies, and the vac doesn't have enough power to keep them clean on its own.",
Kornelia Surmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hallelujah! THE time saver I have been searching for!!,the United States,22-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this on the suggestion of a friend. I have cats (and not just two). My evening consisted of vacuuming first and then steam cleaning my floors. No more! I can do this in one handy dandy step with the Bissell Crosswave and the floors come out clean. It leaves behind a clean smell throughout my house. It cut at least an hour out of my daily cleaning routine. Love this product and in particular when used with the Bissell Pet Cleaning solutions. Definitely recommend this product for anyone who has pets or kids. It's a game changer.One thing - read about bearings breaking, etc. You HAVE to clean this machine every time you use it to keep in in top working condition. Also highly recommend to invest the couple of extra dollars to buy an extended warranty to protect your investment.",2
Douglas Brown,2.0 out of 5 stars,Updated - My Third Bissell Crosswave,the United States,6-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I just bought my third Bissell Crosswave. I suppose you might ask why? Well the answer is that the Crosswave works very well for my situation cleaning up after three mini-dachshunds who refuse to go outside when it is wet and seem to be unable to center up on the potty pad even at the best of times.As for the reason I have bought three of them (obviously - one at a time), is that the first two failed. Number one developed leaks from the dirty water tank, next the solution bottle cap blew apart, requiring that it be replaced. Then the unit developed such poor suction (despite replacing filters) it would suck up very little water from the floor.The second Crosswave had the solution bottle cap also come apart (seems to be a reoccurring problem). Next, the unit stopped spraying solution, making the unit worthless at its job. Yes, I went through the troubleshooting guide and checked for blocked tubing, everything was clear.So far number three is working fine, but if it fails I doubt that I will buy a fourth one. This is getting way too expensive for what is basically an electric mop.All in all, I really like the way the Bissell Crosswave works, when it works (I would have given it five stars for how well it works as a floor cleaner, if I was still using unit number one). Bissell needs to review their design and build quality or they will lose customers and not just for the Crosswave, but anything branded Bissell.Updated -4-19-19...Sadly, my third bissell joined the other two in failure. First the cap on the clean water bottle blew apart. The last time this happened I bought an extra cap, so I was able to replace the bad one. This particular bissell was a ""used"" one from the Amazon warehouse. It was new, but the box was was too badly damaged and the unit had to be repacked in regular box. When it arrived, the bissell looked to in excellent condition and figured great I saved a hundred bucks.As it turns out, this unit stopped pumping solution yesterday and being a used unit, it only had a 30 day guarantee...  Great for Amazon/Bissell, not so great for me as it lasted a whole six weeks. Two weeks past the warranty period.The unit still has good suction and the scrubbing bush works fine, so I will continue to use it by sprinkling solution on the floor and then cleaning up the mess with the bissell, it works well enough for my need. However this is the last Bissell product I will ever buy.I wonder how many of those other reviewers have had their bissells fail, but never bothered to update their review. I suspect that the failure rate is far higher than the ratings would indicate... any class action lawyers out there???",

The Aimster,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Enough,the United States,6-Feb-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I like more things than not. Really like the vacuum and water spray feature.  I use to first vacuum the floors, then mop the floors, then dry with towels.  I always wanted something like this as it does cut time in half since does all three at one time.  My floors look really nice when done.Only complaints is that you can’t reach underneath beds, dressers etc at all.  So I do have to get out another tool to get underneath.  Also, I sometimes don’t choose to use the bissel because I don’t feel like cleaning it afterwards and will just op to vacuum.  Cleaning it isn’t too bad for what it does but will add about 15 minutes afterwards.",One

We have 2 toddlers, 2 dogs and a cat and have used this weekly for a couple months now. Cleaning it is mildly annoying (but SO NECESSARY or it’ll stink), and yeah the floors are streaky if I don’t take my time, but to be able to sweep and mop all at once, no worrying about a bucket for the pets and kids to spill or piles getting tracked all over before I can sweep them all up. This is amazing!!

So vacuuming and mopping are needed daily.  I love how simple and quick it is to clean my floors now.  My husband keeps saying I sound like an infomercial because I keep telling all of my friends to get one!It's simple to use, and simple to clean.

Chelsea Mckarns,2.0 out of 5 stars,Neat Idea but not worth it,the United States,5-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I dont write reviews but i thought this one needed to be made. we have all hardwood floors throughout the house, 4 dogs and 3 people. I went through almost every review for this thing but honestly it wasnt what i expected. You have to clean (and by clean, i mean CLEAN) out the entire vacuum after each use or the dog hair will be stuck in the suction and make the hair fly across the room. after a couple minutes the water used on the floor turns brown and leans marks all over the hardwood. this vacuum only works if you arent looking to clean your floors but just to clean up a tiny spot that your little human dropped on the floor, nothing more. Not worth the money spent on this, my sister bought the green Bissel that mops and vacuums as well and she is having the same issue with hers. if youre looking for a sign not to get it, this is the sign!",
Marcia C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best floor care product I've ever owned.,the United States,3-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical but decided to try the pet pro model, as I have two long hair house cats.  The strainer is a must if you have pets.  The floor in my bathroom is always hard to clean, too much hairspray.  The Crosswave cleaned it unbelievably well, even the grout lines!  Suction is very good, even against baseboards and in corners.  But the real plus is the wet mop action. I cleaned all my wood floors in half the time it usually takes me to swiffer, sweep then wet mop.  The floor dried very quickly.  A little extra time on stubborn spots, such as the juice someone spilled in front of the fridge, left the area spotless.  No sticky residue, no scrubbing and far less dry time than any wet floor product.  I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.",One

Now I have only used it once and will update my review after several uses but I cannot see this changing! Cleaning ability is AMAZING! I have 2 german shepherds on is long hair and it cleaned the floor with ease and picked up all their mess. If you are on the fence with one of these product I would get this one.,One
Thomas,1.0 out of 5 stars,The pump that moves the cleaning solution quit after 6 uses.,the United States,11-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The pump died. This machine was delivered on 5/5/2021. I used it on my 3k, hard floor only, home six times and the pump that moves the cleaning solution quit. I am returning it. I was not impressed anyway, so no big loss. I still had to clean the edges, next to the baseboards, with a cloth. This machine is a great idea, but not functional yet. It has to be moved so slow, that it takes longer than a sweep and mop combined. I was willing to keep it, for quick kitchen clean up's, but then the pump gave up, so back it goes.",

This one is better, came with an extra cleaning head and solution. Be careful when taking off the top to the clean water/solution bottle. While doing so, the outer ring kind of striped and came off without pulling out the stopper basically due to crappy design. Bissell is sending me free of charge a replacement cap, but in the meantime I went ahead and tried to get the stopper out running it under warm water, which loosed it and reassembled it and it worked fine. A better and stronger machine than the regular CW. Watch Bissell's YouTube on cleaning it and follow all directions.",

Amos McLean,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bottom line: floors get cleaned more often,the United States,16-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have never minded mopping, but fitting it into the schedule meant that it didn't get done as often as I would like.With the Crosswave, it makes the task much quicker and easier, so it gets done more often.Cleanup is a little harder than the video shows. It's not a matter of simply flipping the strainer over and letting things fall into the trash. It's wet matted pet hair, so it takes both hands to maneuver things into the trash without making a mess.I was expecting some construction to look a little more durable, but I suppose they made trade-offs with weight and costs. So far, it has not caused any issues.I was a bit skeptical of going back and forth between area rugs and hard floors, but with a pause in between, it has worked fine.No complaints about how well it cleans.Several reviews mentioned it leaving a wet surface behind. In my experience, its far drier than mopping. Maybe some folks are holding the spray trigger down too much/all the time.Glad I bought it. I suspect you will be, too.",One

K. Grider,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m impressed!!,the United States,8-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Wow! I have been considering this machine for a couple months now. I finally bought it, and it’s a game-changer. I have a whole house (2300 sq ft) of hardwood floors. Mopping the entire thing usually requires 2-3 hours and lots of strenuous physical activity. I just now did the whole house in an hour. This thing is amazing!! Drying time was very fast, and I found that going back over an already cleaned are without dispensing solution (as the user guide recommends) helps it dry even faster. I’m talking dry within a few minutes.Full disclosure: I did vacuum prior to using it, as I have three dogs. Bissell claims this is unnecessary, but I can see now why people have complained about the “ick” of emptying the dirty water/strainer if they haven’t pre-vacuumed.All in all, this gem made a back-breaking task a breeze. I was skeptical, and now I’m sold. Buy it!!!!",

This product allows for me to easily mop and clean the house much faster than a Swiffer or a mop ever could. I still vacuum up the hair before using the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro but this product has saved me countless hours of cleaning. It also works great for kitchen messes. Highly recommend. Many family members have bought and they love the product as well. I DO RECOMMEND using Bissell cleaning solution and not other brands like Bora or basic soap solutions. I see the best results with using the Bissell brand cleaning solutions.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will never be without one,the United States,6-May-21,Crosswave Pet + Hardfloor Sanitize Formula 80oz,Verified Purchase,I have three children with a fourth on the way and two dogs. I would sweep and mop once a day and the floor would be filthy by the time everyone went to bed. This is so easy to grab and go around the kitchen and living room (small house). I will never go back to all that work I did before. The floors are always clean now just because it so easy to just grab and go. I use it like three to four times a day to pick up food and spills the kids make. Definitely a five star item.,
Linda H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use & hard-working,the United States,21-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,So far there is nothing to dislike about this vacuum.  I have almost all hardwood and vinyl floors but have animals - the floors are hard to keep clean.  This gem has made it so much easier to do just that.  The fact that you can vacuum and wash your floors at the same time is a time-saver!  Best investment I've made in a long time.,2
RealMcCoy25,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a GREAT job on hard floors.  Jury is still out on area rugs.,the United States,16-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I went over my floor with my Swiffer Sweeper w/pet pad, which I think does a pretty good job.  But when I used the Crosswave immediately afterward, it picked up A LOT of dirt and dog hair.  I used to have a Hoover Floormate; this does a better job of cleaning.  Floor dried within a minute or two.  I would definitely recommend this product for hard floors.If you're planning to use it on area rugs, REMOVE THE BRUSH to wash it first.  I used the tray to clean it, but I still think it the dirt that was deep inside the brush got rubbed onto the rug.  It also left the rug damper than I would have liked, since it's on a wood floor.  Luckily, it was a heavy rug, so I was able to use my Big Green carpet cleaning machine to suck up the excess moisture.  If you're looking for a good cleaner for carpets and heavy area rugs, I highly recommend the Big Green Machine.",

M. Black,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,1-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have had this product for myself for a little over a year. It does a great job cleaning the wood, linoeum and tile.  I like that there are no bags to replace and it is easy to clean out. It was worth it to get the pet pro with the insert that pulls out the cat hair from the refuse tank for you. It does a great job getting up pet hair. The vacuum is strong and pulls in dust from the corners as you approach.  The mopping feature works well. If you hold the button too long and get the bristles too wet it leaves behind a muddy mess, but if you just use a little fluid intermittently it works great, so don't overdo it with the cleaning fluid.  I liked it so much I purchased as a gift for 3 others.  I hope it lasts a long time.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great in theory. Falls short in Reality.,the United States,4-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was very disappointed with the cleaning results. The roller left marks all over the floors. When I was finished using the cross wave, I didn’t think my floors even looked clean. In fact, my floors look cleaner after I run my robot vac than they did with the cross wave.  I also used this on a welcome mat, which was only in use a week at most. While it cleaned the mat, it tracked dirty water on the tile. I would not recommend this product. I gave the cross wave a week and returned.",
Kathi Greyhosky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than bucket and mop!,the United States,3-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I purchased this actually for the linoleum floors at my business where my males employees track in quite a bit of dirt on their boots. I like the fact that I don’t get to the point where I’m putting dirty water back on the floor or need to change water three times before I’m done. But I took it home to do my tiled floors there. I have an elderly diabetic dog that has accidents at least a couple times a week and this makes clean up easier and better in my opinion.  And I  like that the floor is dry in no time at all. I just wish it would be better somehow cleaning the edges.,2
Wendy D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maneuvers well, picks up all sorts of debris and is simple to clean up for storage until next use.",the United States,16-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I don't know what the complaints are all about and hope that this thing lasts, because I absolutely love it. I have 3 black labs and 2 cats, so pet hair is always everywhere. This thing cut my cleaning time down to 1/3 of the time. I usually run through the house with my vacuum first, moving the cord all over, etc... then I would warm up the steam mop and run it all over, moving the cord multiple times as well as changing the mop cover at least once because it would get so filthy. This thing was a dream, I did everything with 1 move of the cord, no biggie and clean up was very easy. Love it!",3

Rob,5.0 out of 5 stars,5+ stars!,the United States,26-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’ve had this for a year and 2 months now. This is 100% the best option for cleaning tile and hardwood floors! Easy to clean, gets in the tight spaces, and leaves the floor clean. If you have pets and tile floors, this thing is a must. Both my girlfriend and myself brag on this vacuum a lot. I’ve saved hours of my life and tons of money by not having to buy swifter wet pads and sponge mops. I do still use a traditional mop first if I’m doing a white glove level cleaning every few months or so but just for a quick weekly maintaining cleaning or to clean up an “accident” it works perfectly.",
Vidz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best way to easily maintain clean floors anytime. Cleaning just became easier.,the United States,5-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this Bissell crosswave because it combines the vacuuming with mopping. It is easier than using a mop anyday. I have used the Swifer sprayer and mop but that you have to scrub in to remove dried up spots due to our pet drips when drinking water or so. With the Bussell Croswave Pet Pro, also with the solution it comes with, the spots are easily removed without any much effort. It is also very easy to manipulate and it is quite lite, easy to bring upstairs and downstairs when needed. It works well with tiles in the kitchen then transitions easily to work with hardwood. The only hiccup is it may have excess soap suds if there is an uneven panel in the floor. All pet hairs are also vacuumed out so it is pretty much a one job does all trick!",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money for meh,the United States,7-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love Bissell products. Usually, that’s what I end up with. I looked at other hardwood floor cleaners and this one seemed to have a higher review. Totally disappointed with this. I’ve had it a couple of months now and I hate that I’m going to have to start the search again. I have four kids and three pets in the house and I wish this worked better. Seemed like the perfect solution but suction isn’t the best and it seems to just push dirt around. I’ve bought replacement brushes and filters and only use the cleaner that is recommended and nothing helps. It also leaves streaks 👎🏼 Wish bissell had a better product.",2

Lord only knows what gets tracked into my house. This thing has been a huge help cleaning up after them all. Not really a deep clean product for rugs but it does amazing on my hardwoods and laminate! I use it to freshen up area rugs often and I was thoroughly disgusted by what it pulled off of a freshly mopped floor so it’s doing something right!,One
abcMama,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money!!!,the United States,17-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this thing! Worth every single penny. I have 3 kids, 2 cats & a dog and a husband who is a plumber. I don’t have time to get on my hands and knees and scrub my floor every week. However now...my floors have never been this clean. It literally takes all the hassle out of vacuuming and then steam mopping. I just use this all in one! And every time I use it, my mind is blown at how disgusting our floors are.The only con is that it doesn’t get super, super close to the baseboards, but close enough! I’m in love!",
cassie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it's worth it!!",the United States,12-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant about buying this but a friend had one and only had good things to say about it. So I bought it and let me tell you best thing ever!! My house is all tile and we have a backyard that is mostly dirt, with us and the cats coming in and out all the time I'm constantly sweeping then pulling out the mop then repeat daily, so time consuming. With this you can vacuum and mop at the same time saving tons of time. I had cleaned my floors with a mop then received this the next day, so I had to test it out. I thought my mop and bucket worked well, boy was I wrong in just one day the water was completely black gross I know but mind blown on how amazing this crosswave is. You will regret not buying this.",
AM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mopping,the United States,9-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Great vacuum and mopper all at once! Great suction gets the dust out and the water turns black!

"BSW Houston, TX",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Shipped a used machine, but paid for a new one!",the United States,30-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I did not use it. I thought something was off when I opened the door after delivery. The machine had been repackaged and delivered to me as new in a Bissell brown cardboard box. That is not normal packaging for this item. I opened the box and immediately noticed a stain on the instruction booklet. I also removed the handle just to reaffirm my suspension that the unit had been used and yes I could clearly see a ring which appeared to be grease from having been attached to the body previously. Needless to say, I returned it. Shipping used items seems to be a common practice for companies now. These companies should fined stiff penalties for this practice.",
Susan Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not good on long cat hair,the United States,22-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"When this said Pet Pro, I read the reviews and literature and thought I’d finally found a vacuum that would remove animal hair without going over the same place five times. No. In fact I don’t see that it vacuums any hair as I’ve had to cut it off the roller two times. Went back over instruction booklet several times. But no, I don’t see it vacuuming any pet hair. Granted it’s longhair cat but I still expected something.Other that that it’s a pretty good vacuum.",
carrie d gateff,1.0 out of 5 stars,Messy  and after 7 months does not work,the United States,21-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"First i love the machine being lightweight and was excited to clean floors. However, the machine didn't meet my expectations when it came to the performance when cleaning floors. When the solution mixed with dirt and pet hair, it became very messy to clean the canister. The hair and dirt clogged the machine which created another problem of having to clean out the curved part of machine. After each use, you have to clean out the clogged dirt and hair.For being 7 months ago and already having deteriorating performance, I am told by Bissell that I have to take it in to one of their service centers. This is a complete hassle for a product less than a year old at this price point. I have another brand of vacuum, not a wet/dry one, but it's old and still cleans floors. Unfortunately, this will now be going in the trash. Yours might have the same fate.",2
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Would not purchase,the United States,18-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This actually cleans the floors pretty good and vaccums them well.  The part I did not like was that it left the floors very wet.  I had to keep going over the same spot 10 times to try to get water up even then they are left pretty wet.  I used a whole container of water but when I emptied the used water it was only about 3 ounces....so the rest was on the floor.  It also is a huge pain and takes about 15 minutes to take it all apart to clean it out and its nasty.  The premise is nice for this product but it needs quite a bit better technology before I would purchase.  I sent mine back after one use.,
TristianElizabeth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for textured floors,the United States,16-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We have plank vinyl that has texture to it and they are impossible to clean. It made me very angry to mop my floors for an hour only to walk on them later and have dirty feet.The cross wave is amazing! I cleaned just my living room and the amount of dirt it picked up was both disgusting and satisfying. I feel like it takes a bit more time than mopping but the results are totally worth it. I took the time to vacuum my floors before using this so I didn’t have “chunky” water to clean out of the cross wave and to me it is worth the extra effort. There was still a little bit of cat hair in the water but it was easily removed with the strainer.,
valerie h.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't wait, it is worth every cent! Life saver!",the United States,26-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The only thing I disliked was that I waited so long in deciding to finally purchase one! Wish I had years ago! This has saved me so much, I am truly grateful to the makers of this one. Above and beyond! I have rescued dogs for 18 yrs or so now, it can be very messy and very time consuming cleaning up after them. This machine has cut my work time down by hours! Absolute must have, couldn't be happier.....well unless my dogs all start wiping their paws when they come in evey time and finally realize what potty training really is about, lol!",
KSH,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!!,the United States,15-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Wow. Love it! Had no idea my floors were this dirty until they were actually cleaned by this thing. I have ALL wood floors and one area rug which is actually brand new so pretty much all of this funk came from my wood floors. Picture was after cleaning only 3 rooms. So far i love it! Got it after seeing my mom use hers and she loves it too. I have one dog and a new kitten, 2 kids and a husband. Ive swept and mopped 2-3x a week so i was surprised to see such dirty water when i emptied the collection tank. Love that this lets you rinse the machine and remove the roller for drying.Update: Used it to clean the floor mats in my 10 year old car- amazing!!!",
Francis Planco,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!!!,the United States,16-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this machine! It's perfect for my floors! I have used it on hard wood laminate, carpet and tile. If there is a lot of dirt I use only as vacuum first and then I use the mop action. I love that it cuts my cleaning time in half by doing two chores in one.I'll say that I have noticed some people complain about streaks but that seems to only happen if I use too much solution. If you vacuum over to help dry, that helps.  And if there is tough gunk on the floor I have used the carpet setting and that helps scrub it off a little more. Last, it's not a shampooer so I doesn't remove hard carpet stain but it does clean and vacuum them.Overall I'm very pleased with it. Again, cutsy cleaning time in half and doesn't hurt my back like sweeping and mopping. No more dirty mop bucket!!!",
Angela,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it!,the United States,16-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love this product! I put off buying one because of the price but finally did it. Mop and vac in one go with easy clean up. Best thing I've bought in a while! Worth every penny. My only complaint is on high traffic areas I have to go over them more than once. That's not really a complaint, it's just the only bad thing I can say about it. Oh and it has so much power that it doesn't work well on my smaller kitchen rugs.",
Sum Dum Gai,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 7 or 8 uses (5 months after purchase).,the United States,22-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This machine is a joke - this is our second one. This one was bought in April 2021. After 7 or 8 uses, my wife tells me the roller brush stopped working. Took a look, and know what went wrong. There's no seal to protect the plastic housing.Am contacting Bissell, and if they support it - great. If they don't....I'm gonna have one hell of a fury.Will change rating if I can get Bissell support. Will let you know.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,it gets the job done,the United States,5-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum does what i wanted it to do, i have a german shepherd so there’s a TON of dog hair everyday. I use this vacuum 1-2 times a day but it does have some flaws. First all I’ve had it for 3 months but withen the first couple days I noticed a strong stinky smell coming from the vent when I used it and I clean it after every use as well as run some bleach water through it. It still smells. It also sometimes leaves dirty water streaks while cleaning. Overall I am happy with the vacuum because it eliminates a cleaning step but it does have a few annoying flaws.",
Deborah L. Woodstuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing....,the United States,11-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Prior to the Bissell Crosswave I scrubbed  my kitchen, foyer, and bathrooms on my hands and needs.  It took me a couple of hours.  Now with the Bissell Crosswave I can  clean them all in less than an hour.  It works great.  I no longer have to sweep or run the sweeper over the hard floors prior to scrubbing.  The Crosswave does both at the same time.  It takes a little while to familiarize your self with the process but it gets easier each time I do it.I have a cat and a dog and it picks up their hair!  I have also used on my hardwood and it works great on those floors as well.  I do not have any area rugs, if I get any I will let you know how it works on those as well",
Ervina,3.0 out of 5 stars,It was great while it worked,the United States,15-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had this vacuum for a few months before it started acting up. While I had it and it worked, I loved it. It made cleaning my wood floors much easier and quicker. Some flaws to it were that you couldn't get all the way to the baseboard of the wall because of the thickness of the wheels and I wish it was a little stronger in suction and scrubbing. That was pretty much my only complaint. I cleaned it after every use, never dropped it, never damaged it but somehow it just broke and now it just leaks water all over the place. I can't figure out where the problem is, but I'm sad it didn't last all that long, especially for a little bit of a pricier product.",2
Deedra M,1.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love this thing but I couldn't,the United States,14-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It does not vacuum and mop at the same time like they make it seem on the commercial. When you mop it leaves a muddy mess after a few minutes and my light colored floor looks dirty after I mop because of it.,5
Debi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on pet spots!,the United States,5-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Purchased this for spot cleaning wall to wall carpet and for linoleum.  It states it can be used on area rugs, but I was hoping it would work to clean spots. And it did!  New dog has issues with dribbling, this unit cleaned them up!  I will still use my big Bissell for thorough cleaning, but it’s nice to have a lightweight cleaner for in between spots.  And it did a good job on the linoleum!",
Maya,4.0 out of 5 stars,Few things could be better but overall great.,the United States,1-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I do love using this and it has helped me keep my floors really clean. I've read a lot of bad reviews on this and was hesitant on buying it but I did anyways and got the 2 year warranty. I wish it was cordless and had a hose for doing stuff like furniture or stairs. It was difficult up against the wall but I think most vaccums have that issue. If you have dried liquids on the floor is reccomend putting a little hot water into the area let it soak a minute and then use the vacuum to help scrub it. But for the most part it's easy and great to use.If water comes out of the sides from the vents just empty out the dirty water as it does that when it's filled up. I didn't enjoy the hair trap thing because you have to touch it. Not a great feeling. But easy to clean.,
Russell J. Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing sucks! (In a good way),the United States,22-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This thing is the bomb. Sucks up hair, cereal and water mild whatever all in 1 go. It basically buffs the floor clean and picks up all the ickyness. We use it every couple days and the tank is FILLED with BLACK water. It's incredible how dirty the floors get in suck a short amount of time, and we're not total slobs I promise. This is expensive and if you have mostly carpet its probably a luxury. But if you have hard floors this is a must buy. It works really good. You won't believe how gross your floors are till you run this thing over them.",
Megan Garrett,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it so much,the United States,5-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love it so much. Even more than I hoped!

JamieOM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!! Great for pet messes.,the United States,30-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This crosswave is amazing! I’ve used it on our area rugs, door rugs, wood floors, linoleum floors, and tile. It’s a slight pain to clean up, but I’m very OCD so I like it to be completely clean when I’m done. If you use the holder for cleaning as stated in the manual, it works really well! I’ve cleaned up new stains as well as old stains and the only thing it hasn’t gotten out all the way has been oil. (I find that to be understandable though) The pet formula smells great! It’s crazy to see how much nastiness comes off of my floors.",

It worked through everything 3 dogs & 3 cats have managed to do to it in the past month of only spot cleaning messes and accidents....And I have to say it is quite possibly the best cleaning product I have ever purchased and I look forward to having regularly fully cleaned floors!!  It was super easy to assemble and use, and my floors look just as good as they do when I sweep and mop, in less than half the time, with even less effort (use to breaking into a dripping sweat)!  I work +/-60hrs a week and want to actually spend time with my pets,  not just cleaning up after them and I can already tell that I can look forward to some extra downtime with them in a much cleaner home.",6
Jerrod,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No, just from looking at it.",the United States,16-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Maybe I'm mistaken but I'd expect some level of quality for something costing over $300. This thing looks like something Swiffer would sell for $70. Everything about it screams cheap and chintzy. Just the cheapo handle you have to slide into the base feels like it will snap if you push too hard. It's going straight back without even plugging it in. Nope! Getting a Dyson and I'll use my, not $300, Swiffer to mop.",
George G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A LOT MORE MACHINE THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD GET.,the United States,2-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"AFTER assembly it got put it to a rotten task, a linoleum floor full of cooking grease an pet hair, i didnt use the cleaner that came with the machine, i used super clean measured it just like the brand name stuff. it cleaned it up fine no stickyness on the floor, it seperated the pet hairs from the dirty water so it could go down the sink an i was able to put the pet hairs in the trash. this was not a luxury kitchen like on the infomercial, it did broken egg shells rice cooking scraps everything you may find under your stove, i was pleased.",

Unless you think you will loke having to go over the same area 4-5 times to get the carpet clean, while having to struggle to push the unit forward (you would think this would mean the unit has mega suction, let me be clear IT DOES NOT!), and then you get the extra special gift of having to clean your vacuum after every use (who has TIME for this?).  Just say NO!",
Emily McDonald,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, it's possible to love an appliance.",the United States,11-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is a LIFE CHANGER.  With kids, pets, and rainy leaves tracked all over the house, this one-step cleaning solution could not be easier to fit into our busy lives.  I absolutely love it!  The clean water tank lasts significantly longer than most carpet cleaners we have had, even Bissell brand models.I think it's great to expect that it can handle area rugs and small pet urine stains on regular carpet, but it's not meant for lots of actual broadloom carpet.  Works amazingly well on lower pile area rugs, but it's really built for hard surfaces.  This replaces my steam mop, swiffer wet, swiffer dry, broom, dustpan, and real mops for sure.  I'm hanging on to my Roomba and upright vacuums for the carpet.",
DR,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for Tile,the United States,29-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this thinking I could throw my mop away for good. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case because this machine didn’t do a good job on my tile flooring. The machine leaves my tile sticky and with lots of streaks. Also, it leaves water on the tile because it doesn’t completely vacuum it up and you can definitely tell that it’s not cleaning the tiles evenly. This is a $300+ machine and I should expect it to do a great job. Definitely not good on tile!",2
Travis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,the United States,12-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I know every married or might as well be married man has heard all about this new Bissell crosswave thing.

So of course I'm sitting here like ""they ain't no way this crazy ass woman needs another vacuum!""Well its no secret I spend money on race cars and race car activities pretty much nonstop and I never hear a single word about it. Me being the wonderful, caring, very understanding husband that I am (😬) I went ahead and got her one anyway. This has been by far the best thing I've ever done to date!I ain't never in my life seen someone be so excited about a vacuum! I'll catch her talking to the dog begging her to shed some dog hair! She encourages me to track mud through the house now. This is no joke, the other day she was using it and there was a Gatorade on the counter. I literally picked it up opened the lid and dumped it all on the floor. She looked up at me and gave me the biggest smile ever and proceeded to just mop it up!Moral of the story is if you are anything like me and stay on thin ice than this is the vacuum your wife needs! When that ice starts to melt she will grab this thing and forget all about it!",

It picks up so well, and it separates the hair from the dirty water! It also came with a coupon for 50% off the pet multi-surface with Febreze formula 3 pack from Bissell's website along with free shipping. It already came with an extra brush roll, and two trial sizes of the formula, but I went ahead and purchased the 3 pack because with the coupon came out to $14.99 for all 3- 32oz bottles. Well worth it in my opinion!",2
Kathryn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for tile floors,the United States,8-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I wouldnt go as far to say that this vacuum makes cleaning fun, but it is as close as you are going to get.  It is so satisfying to see how much mud ends up in the reservoir. It is very easy to clean and disassemble after use, it is small enough to leave out for quick clean ups after toddler meals and it leaves my flores looking freshly mopped.It is a little hard to push over area rugs because the suction is so strong but I got this mainly to clean tile.",
JK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Picks up pet hair - NO problem,the United States,26-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The machine works great on pet hair, the brush picks it all up on hardwood floors!  And the formula leaves a very pleasant scent in the room, not overwhelming.  I have 3 dogs that are not heavy shedders but do leave small wisps of hair behind between groomings.  This machine also cleans up stains and prints with ease.  I had a similar machine in the past that used a great amount of cleaning formula each time; this machine uses less product so it is also a cost saver.  Have not used it yet on an area rug.  Highly recommend for pet owners!",

Spydie,1.0 out of 5 stars,can't be used for a vacuum,the United States,2-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is advertised as a vacuum/wet floor cleaner, but it's really only a wet floor cleaner.  The vacuum is useless.  And the wet floor cleaner leaves streaks on my tile regardless how many times I clean and rinse the roller.  If you use this, always vacuum the floor before using it as the vacuum side of this picks up very little and makes a mess of wet dog hair and such, which it can't suck up because the vacuum power is so poor.  Vacuum your floor first, then just use this as a wet mop.  You might be happier with it.",2

I used to have to sweep, vacuum edges, and then swiffer/mop and scrub. It would take forever. This does all of that at once. Picks up dog hair so well too! Use it on our area rug as well. The solution smells so good! Yes you have to empty it and clean it after every use but with the rinse tray it takes one second. I let all my parts air dry before putting it back together (like it says to in the manual) and have no issue with wet dog smell like I’ve seen other reviews mention. And our dog in stinky!Definitely recommend!",
Andres Moreno,3.0 out of 5 stars,Power suction is amazing,the United States,3-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It’s a good vacuum cleaning, awesome power suction but the maneuverability not so much. It’s super heavy and I’m a man with some strength yet after certain time my arm stars to resent and have to stop or change to the other arm. It’s not good for small spaces with furniture and stuff because it’s big and difícil to handle between those spaces. Although must be wonderful for big spaces with few things. Oh! And you can’t use it under beds, sofas etc due to the nozzle size",
AP,5.0 out of 5 stars,We Love our new mop/vacuum,the United States,27-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We couldn’t be happier with our new mop/vacuum. For years we would use what’s referrred to here in Miami as a “Cuban Mop” which is basically a piece of wood with a rag attached to the end vía a joke in it and ran through the handle. I never felt like this mop actually cleaned our floors properly. I finally convinced my Wife to switch. On day one I used our new mop just after she cleaned the floors with the “Cuban mop”. We were both very shocked at the amount of dirt was still on the floor. The canister was filled with brown disgusting mud water. Needless to say we are now officially Bissel crosswave fans.,2

I JUST tonight got a new vacuum/mop.  OMG, if any other person is trying to find a good vacuum/mop get the new Bissell.  Its does dry and wet vacuuming.  It picks up the tinest pcs on the hardwood that a normal vacuum would blow back because it does not have an airfilter.  I swear I do not think my kitchen (ceramic like tile) has been this clean.",

This machine is perfect for getting the puddles of pee and refreshing the room.  If I have tougher stains on the floor or in the grout lines, my results are not as good, so I keep my traditional mop handy for those instances.  Overall, really happy with this machine.",One

I got straight to work and for the first 20 minutes it was all I dreamed of.  Then a horrible sound started and only water spitting out.  I cannot for the life of me figure out what is wrong.  I do know day 1 it messes up, it will not be able to keep up after my family with dogs.  It only has to operate after my roomba too.  I’m so sad,  wanted to ditch the swifter, swifter mop, mop and bucket, maybe the dyson....for extra projects only.  For me the hunt will continue but this is an amazing concept.",4

Tara Hupp,3.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money. Do not buy if you have animals in the house.,the United States,7-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Loses suction if there's too much dirt or hair(DO NOT buy if your dogs shed....you basically need to sweep before using it...and I only have 1 semi-long haired dog that sheds). It also doesn't pick up the hair good while mopping, so you have to just use the vacuum function first then go back and mop it.....And it started leaving spots of water all over while using it. It also leaves a gap(about 3-4 inches) on both sides as far as the mopping part goes....so getting right up to the baseboards while mopping is out of the question...you basically have to go back with a swiffer to right up close. Definitely not worth the $300 at all. Don't waste your money.",

Checked plug, used another plug, powered up, and stopped. That's it for me. No more Bissel.",
marvin t.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,6-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this and was very disappointed with the cleaning power of this product I was excited to receive this cleaner, but I really was dissatisfied with the cleaning power of the the carpet and rug cleaning ability of this machine, it cleaned bare floors really well, but I can get a less pricy bare floor cleaner that works just as well, the suction power on bare floors was ok on carpet or rugs it was not what was expected",
Lizzo,4.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is awesome if you have wood floors and pets!!,the United States,26-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The only thing I can say is the tank for the dirty water is so small and can fill up pretty quick! Also the solution samples they send with it are awesome but I don't know if I was just goin a little buckwild or what but the solution goes fast also. Haven't been able to see what the cost of the cleaning solutions are yet but I used some Mr Clean in it and it worked great. Super easy to clean out afterwards.  Don't throw out your regular vacuum or mops, this thing is phenomenal but doesn't replace the need for them altogether. Not super loud, leaves the floor shining and it n dries so quickly also!!! Couldn't believe it. This is not a carpet cleaner!! It mops n vacuums at the same time n you can clean throw/area rugs with it and it doesn't soak them & dries quickly.",
joan banai,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easey to use and clean,the United States,30-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was worried it would be a pain to clean. Similar to a rug scrubber.  But its not. It is really simple, all the part come apart toneasily rense. 5 min and your done.  I was spending 3 hours on my hardwood floors. Sweek, vaccume then mop.  I am sure i will still do this process weekly or bi-weekly.

Lisa Lord,3.0 out of 5 stars,Piece of crap!,the United States,8-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This machine is absolutely crap!! If you have dogs that shed a lot and expect this to clean it up,  forget it! Does not by any stretch of the imagination live up to its claims!  If you try to clean an area rug, it forms a suction every few swipes and dumps what you’ve already sucked up back on the rug!!  It’s just a mess. Also a pain to take apart and clean. It also leaves about a 1” strip around the walls where it does not get close enough to clean. Very disappointing and use you have to go back and clean the perimeter of the room with a mop or other means. So def not worth it!  Have to clean twice. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I kept too long thinking I would get use to it and I hate it. Wished I had sent it back! Easier to use a mop and rent a rug machine that actually works!!",
AmazonaMama,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not hold up to pet messes,the United States,5-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Have tried to use this product on dry and wet messes. It does not do a better job than any of the $50 spot-bot type items on the market. I would not recommend this to anyone. We have tried it on fresh and ""baked-in"" messes from our cats and dog. It is not in any way worth the cost. Unfortunately, we are out of the return period and very disappointed.",

I previously cleaned with a Shark mop or Swiffer after sweeping my floors, and only felt like I was pushing dirt around.  Th Bissell is fantastic for deep cleaning, and has replaced both my vacuum and hard floor cleaning tools with one compact unit! The floors are left shining and spotless, with a wonderful clean scent. I tested this clean by wiping an area down post cleaning to see if there were any remaining traces of dirt left, and the paper towel was still stark white, floors all sanitized and clean!  I love it, and dare I say, I even enjoy cleaning with this! Buy yourself one!",One

No more pulling out 3 separate tools to clean the floors. I use a 50/50 white vinegar and water mix to clean the hardwoods and rugs. Super easy to use and clean after use. Some reviews said too much water was left on hard floors when using the cleaner, I disagree. The suction is powerful and I’m always disgusted by water lingers behind from our pets, and I wipe paws every time they go in and out. Thanks Bissell for making such a great product!",
AmazSharon Quinnon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Crosswave,the United States,24-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love everything about it.  The only thing that needs work on is when you go to clean it the last thing you need to do.  Is pour the water into the tray and the machine suppose to remove the water from the tray as it cleans the roller.  But it doesn’t remove all the water from the tray.  So I put an old towel down set the machine onto it and pour what water is left in the tray and pour down the sink.  Then I am finished.  I live in Arizona and have 5 dogs that stay inside if they want to.  They bring in a lot of dirt and of course they shed hair.  So my crosswave helps to keep my house clean.  I could go on more about it but I won’t.  If anyone has a specific question I would be glad to help.  Sincerely Sharon,2

This machine is way too much trouble. The dirty water combined with the hair is gross. You manage 2 containers of liquid. One with the cleaning solution, one with the dirty water.

It Turns spills into a simple no sweep and clean. You get the run the mess over with a goo sucking vacuum stick. It demolishes popsicle smudges all over the floor from where your two year old inexplicably squished it. It will pick up the 2,000 grains of rice spilled on top of the smudges two minutes later. With the same tool. Gone are the days of sweeping first and then mopping. It saves you time and it save you a good bit of rage aimed at aforementioned children or pets.

Crystaphaze,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with purchase,the United States,6-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love this thing! Makes doing the floors SO much easier. I have a shoulder injury and having to sweep/vacuum and then mop really was hard for me all in one day. This solved that problem. Its super easy to use. My only critique would be I wish it had a little more scrubbing power. My floor is textured and in the bad areas I have to go super slow for it to get well in all the crevices. But it does well enough and is easy to clean too. I highly recommend this.,2
Robin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Picks up FINE CAT HAIR like a dream!,the United States,19-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"My beautiful fluffy white cat has hair so light that it floats in the air.  My carpet and floors are covered in white fluff and dirt every other day.  This vacuum/mop picks up everything in one or 2 passes, and has largely replaced my other vacuums (even on low carpet!).  It is easy to take apart and clean, and even cleans itself which is amazing.  The brush heads pick up dried up messes in the kitchen very well.  Very sturdy steel neck and plastic handle.  Lightweight and easy to maneuver.  Almost fits below kitchen cabinets, but not quite (wish it were 1/4"" shorter to fit).",
Eileen P Enders,2.0 out of 5 stars,Useless piece of equipment.,the United States,30-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This left streaks all over my floor as well as spots where something was spilled - no deep cleaning at all and that “fresh smelling “ cleaner? smelled nasty. On top of that it came with no instructions on how to get the roller out to clean it & the purple filter kept flying to the top of the compartment & messing it up. Very disappointed with Bissell.,

I don't usually opt for vacs that are corded but the cordless says it had a 30min run time and I can see that being an issue, too much floor to clean and 5 dogs.This cleans great, doesn't glide over carpet as easy as i'd like but not a deal breaker.

Valyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive so far,the United States,7-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've only used it twice since I got it but it works exactly as described so far. I have two dogs an a cat and this thing just sucked up all the mud, dirt, and hair up from the wood floors and area rugs like it was nothing. Only small gripes are the dirt and water compartment are get full quickly if you have a ton of animal fur everywhere but I expect this to be less of a problem with regular use, and it's a bit messy to clean but only because I don't have a utility sink to use, just my kitchen sink. Also, my floors were excessively dirty so I feel like the more I use it, the less I'll have to do a big clean up afterwards. All in all, a great product!",3

Paige,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great for light cleaning,the United States,19-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The suction power and deep cleaning of this took definitely leave a lot to be desired, but overall this is great for cleaning my sticky floors (have an 18 month old and 4 month old!) without having to get in my hands and knees. Will take multiple passes to get it up but still better than elbow grease right now.  It could use slightly more water, especially when going over the rugs to get a decent clean as well. But after 3 passes on my rugs they are feeling better. Overall great tool just needs some better performance to be perfect.",
Anna Garcia,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,4-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I think the idea behind the product is good but it doesn't work for me. It claims to be crosswave pet pro so it's supposed to be good for homes with pets. But, pet hair isn't only on the floor it gets all over the couches and beds. This vacuum mop combo doesn't have a hose which is something highly needed in a pet household. The other thing that I didn't like is that the the dirt and pet hair gets mixed up with the water when vacuuming and mopping at the same time. This creates a muddy mess in the container and not easy to dipose. It's gross when cleaning it and I don't know if to throw it in the toilet or trash. I really regret buying this product especially because I paid $300 for a product that I'm not using due to all the hassle.  I'm hoping I can return it. If this product had a vacuum hose and separated containers for the water and dirt it would be worth it.",
CLK,5.0 out of 5 stars,One Great Floor Cleaner!,the United States,5-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We bought this to clean our hardwood floors in ou large kitchen. We have 3 dogs and the floor is very difficult to keep clean. We decided on this Bissell Cross Wave. It works great! It cleaned all of the grime off our floor and sucked up the water very well. We couldn’t believe how dirty the water was. It was embarrassing to realize just how dirty our floor really was. With as easy as this Crosswave is to use, it definitely won’t happen any more! It was also easy to clean when finished.",

Of course I was between a couple different options and the price made me nervous but I'm SO happy I just did it! There are a handful of parts to clean after but you seriously just rinse them and you're done! Plus all of the other options were just hard surface vacuums. Not a vacuum and mop in one! No streaks, no mess, nothing. My floors are beautiful and every weekend I'm excited to pull it out and use it!

minpin2mom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for tile floors!,the United States,19-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We are very pleased with the Bissell Pro Pet. It was easy to assemble. We have 5 dogs and were finding it very difficult to keep dirt and dog hair off our ceramic tile floors. We previously had a Hoover Floormate and it didn't work as efficiently as the Pro Pet. The Pet Pro has a swivel head which we like a lot plus it is very light weight which I found easier to use. The only complaint I have is that it will leave streaks if you don't suction up all the water. It is not a fast process but it does work very well. I highly recommend this floor cleaner for people with pets. The ""hair trap"" works very well. Cleaning out the dirty water well is not pleasant but I think that is to be expected. We also like the roller cleaning system to be used once you're through cleaning.",2
Roxie,2.0 out of 5 stars,Useless,the United States,11-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"For $300 I had high hopes for this vac/mop.  We just had 2500 square feet of wood laminate floors installed so I was looking for something that would make cleaning quicker and easier.  I was feeling optimistic when I first used it as it did a pretty good job of picking up all the construction dust. I noticed it left a line of dust every time I pulled it back, then forward again. I figured it was because the amount of dust was more than average, so I gave it a few days to see if it improved.  It did not. The “mop” function is completely useless.  Once your roller is a bit dirty it leaves streaks all over the floor.  I’ve read that using the Bona cleaning solution helps, but I just went ahead and bought a $30 Bona mop and it did a much better job than this machine.  Needless to say, this item was returned for a refund.",

Tito C.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Loss of suction,the United States,29-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this product because was labeled to be use by pet owners. I have 2 large dogs that comes in and out of the house and tile floors.  The first few cleanings were ok, not really great. The brushes are not strong enough to remove dirt that the dogs bring in their paws. I had to use additional help with a brush.The product is nearly a year old and is already failing. The suction power is completely gone. The video for trouble shooting was not helpful. This is a very expensive Item for only a year of service. I just called Bisell customer service but the waiting time is long, so I choose for a call back but they never call. Then I found online (not their website as it was not working) an authorized dealer in my area and took the machine to them. I would not recommend this equipment I rather go back to the bucket of water and a mop. It never fails.I would not recommend this product. Not worth the cost.",

Emily,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t Bother Spending the Money,the United States,27-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this device after seeing great reviews on multiple sites, but I can easily say that this might be the worst item I’ve ever owned. For a vacuum that claims to be for pets, it has a really hard time sucking up any pet hair. The suction is terrible, it barely sucks up basic dirt, let alone dog food or any other pet related messes. The wet vacuum option leaves dirt marks, no matter how many times you empty the tank or try to clean off the brush roll. Additionally, using the wet vacuum option comes with a lot of clean up afterwards, the whole machine has to be disassembled and allowed to dry out, so I dread using the function because of how much time it takes to use. A swiffer wetjet can do a much better job in a 1/4 of the time and for a fraction of the cost. Don’t even try to use the Bissell on area rugs, unless you want a soggy mess and for your rugs to look dirtier than when you started. I can’t stress enough that this vacuum isn’t worth the money.",
ChaChiMo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you Bissell for inventing it !,the United States,12-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"My God ! The BEST ELECTRIC MOP ever invented, I swear ! Thank you Bissell for coming up with this great cleaning tool ! It makes mopping the floors a joy. I moved my Shark Rotator upstairs for the carpets, and I only use this on the ground floor for the hard wood. Incredibly easy to clean the entire lower system and the collecting container, and wash everything like brand new. The brush I washed it in the sink, not in the tray - better rinsing in my opinion. Again, I am delighted, it is worth every penny !",
Jazmyn Heathcock,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dog mom approved,the United States,20-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Oh my lanta this is literally the best thing I’ve ever purchased! I usually have to sweep, mop, and sweep again every day in order for my house to feel even remotely clean with three dogs and me go in and out while doing yard work. I use this thing once and it’s spotless with no dirt, hair, or dust anywhere! Most of the negative reviews on here relate to having to constantly clean the dirty water tank and brush holder thingy on the front. But that’s a small price to pay for the amount of time and effort this vacuum saves me. It’s not a magic wand and needs cleaning out after every use if you’re deep deep cleaning. Don’t throw away your broom and swifter. This vacuum isn’t for small messes. But boy, does it get the work done. 10000000% recommend.",
JuniorWWT,3.0 out of 5 stars,Need to use Daily,the United States,7-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,If you vacuum daily this one is great. I vacuum once a week and i have to keep emptying the canister very frequently. I now vacuum the floor with my other vacuum first then use the cross wave afterwards to mop. Then I only have to empty the canister when it’s full of water vs full of hair/dirt. I also have tile with grout and it doesn’t seem to clean the grout very well.,
francine fanning,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game Changer for Pet owners,the United States,22-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have been looking at this product for a while but wasn’t sure it would be good for me as I have a large home and didn’t think it would do the trick. I was SO wrong.  I have 3500sq ft all tile and 6 pets.  I live in FL where everything is sandy or muddy during the season, and 4 of my pets are mini pigs who love to root.  I am constantly having to vacuumed then mop and repeat!  I also have 2 8 week old puppies, which is why I finally caved in and made the purchase.  My cross wave has already been put through the test and not only surpassed my expectations but completely blew me away with how much dirt it got that I couldn’t see!  Yuck, and I always prided myself on keeping my house clean!!!!!I have only had it for 3 days and so far 2 of my girlfriends who also have pets have also purchased it, including one that clean houses for a living.  Worth every penny and more.  No regrets",
David J. Weaver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, worth the money I spent.",the United States,14-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Works really well. We first got it when we were moving and we had to clean out our apartment and it cleaned our tile floors without any problems whatsoever. We then used it again right away when we moved into our new place. Got rid of the dirt, lift the floors looking great.Only thing I could wish for is a more automatic process for cleaning it, but honestly that's nitpicky.",

I haven't been able to comfortable do that since moving to a tiled home. I couldn't live without this. I wanted it forever and ever before I finally took the chance, and I wish I had forever ago. Thank you soooo much, Bissell.The only thing I wish it did better is getting to the edges of the wall against the baseboards, in the corners. The brush unfortunately just can't get to these areas.",One
Reynaldo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed. Would like a refund,the United States,31-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Very disappointed in this purchase. I was so excited for a new and efficient way to keep up with my cleaning. As a full time working mom with 2 kids under two, there’s a lot to clean but not much time to clean it. A friend suggested this product so I bought it but am highly disappointed. The maneuverability is not great as the machine is very very heavy to use. It did not do a good job soaking up the water once on the floors or area rug. There is a bad odor when the motor runs and I’ve taken the entire thing apart as best as possible and cleaned it many times. I don’t feel like this product was meant for deep cleaning. The dirty water just sits on the floors and the vacuum does not suck up anything well. Very frustrating as it was an expensive buy for our budget.",
Peggy L. Charette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great floor cleaner,the United States,15-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I switched fron another brand because of how light weight it is.  It's east to maneuver and does a great job. A great test is to clean the floors using your usual method then go back over it with the power mop. I was amazed at how much dirt I was leaving behind with my mop. The suction power removes the water and dirt and the floor dries quickly.,

shawna g.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really Works.... worth my money,the United States,30-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I am so excited that I got this product. Okay as you can see it really really really cleaned my area rug. This is directly in front of my front door so high traffic. Great suction it is not self propelled so kinda hard to push but easy to pull back. It did take the whole water tube to clean. Did small area of hard floor great job. Easy to clean machine when done. It’s worth the cost and I’m poor.,
Lisa Wells,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for use as a regular vacuum as advertised,the United States,17-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was very disappointed to learn that this product is not a really good vacuum cleaner. Despite the fact that you can use it as a vacuum, it is not a vacuum that I would need to use with pets. You have to do a deep vacuum cleaning before you clean your carpets, but this machine does not allow you to deep vacuum. I was very disappointed to see that amount of work I had to go through just to find that information. This does a half job As a vacuum and a half job as a cleaner. I returned it and got something different to vacuum.",

The cleaning solution has a wonderful fresh clean smell as well. I have only one complaint regarding the set up with this Bissell, the cord is on the bottom and definitely needs to be located at the top of the machine, it gets in your way while using it, it doesn’t diminish the cleaning but when you have to hold the cord so it doesn’t get in your way (you’ll definitely know what I mean when you use it.)",One

Brandon M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes everything else obsolete!!!,the United States,2-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This thing is fantastic. I have 2 dogs, a toddler, and a wife. They are all messy. I haven't run the carpet cleaner or vacuum since I've bought this. This machine nearly makes them obsolete. I run this on every flooring surface in my house. Long pile area rug, laminate wood, real wood, laminate tile, ceramic tile, short pile carpet. It doesn't seem to leave areas soaked for hours after like the typical carpet cleaner does.The only con to me is the size of the collection tank. For some reason it drives me nuts that I have to empty the collection tank twice before I need to refill the solution tank.",
michael foster,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,the United States,11-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've been in the Dyson camp for years, I just purchased a new home with all wood flooring so I decided to pick this up. The Bissell Pet series really does perform as good or better than advertised. Couldn't be happier with how well it cleans. Suction is great, doesn't leave a big wet mess either.If it had any fault it would be that the strainer that separates solids from the liquid waste tank isn't a flush fit and smaller debris still make it down into the water.",
Kent Killion,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had a burning smell and started smoking the first time it was used!,the United States,14-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"My housekeeper asked me to buy this Bissell because a couple clients of hers have one, and she loves it. I ordered it, it arrived last night, and her first day using it, we smelled a burning smell. Suddenly the whole thing started smoking. Literally smoking like it was going to catch on fire. She said she has never, ever had that happen before. We unplugged it, cleaned it all out, and there was nothing unusual there. I called Bissell. They said there have been a few reports of this happening, but most customers are very pleased. They said for me to to return it to them for repair. I told them no way do I want this product repaired. I don't want it back in my house. I have decided to get an Amazon refund and return it to them. I might try getting another brand new one, but it's rather disconcerting to say the least. Anyone else have this happen?",One
Becky,5.0 out of 5 stars,Actually sucks up litter,the United States,21-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this thing. So it does great with the massive amounts of dog hair in my house, but what really impressed me is that this vaccum actually sucked up litter. LITTER! Most vacuums just throw the litter behind it instead of actually sucking it up. This thing sucked up the litter and mopped, turning the litter into clay and still kept trucking! Clean out was a b-word, but this thing sucked up clay and lived!",
Dan S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than imagined,the United States,11-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have white tile floors covering about 2500 sq ft. I felt all I did was sweep & mop the floors because of animal hair, muddy paw prints and a variety of human messes. Ive used a stick vac for the past 8 years but sometimes the floor is damp from rain or snow and you can't suck that up into a regular canister. The Bissell Crosswave gave me the solution. I love that Im able to switch between vac and wet mode easily and give the floor a quit pass so I always have a fresh, clean looking floor",
Michelle Dorow,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is amazing!!!!,the United States,6-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have 5 dogs and lots of dirt and hair.  Our fur babies consist of an Idaho Shag, a Black & Tan Coon Hound, a Black Lab, a Brittany Spaniel and a Miniature Daschund.  All shedding dogs.  We live in the country and they have acres to roam and get very dirty.  So, my daily cleaning was pretty intense.  We are also farmers so the guys who refuse to take off their shoes when stopping in also contribute to the mess.  I wish I could show you how dirty things get in just one day.  I had been thinking about purchasing the Bissel Crosswave for months.  The idea that I could vacuum and clean my floors at one time was very appealing.  But I could not believe it was possible even though Bissel claimed it was.  Then one night after feeling super overwhelmed with my cleaning tasks I sat down and ordered.  I was anxious when I received mine and so pleasantly surprised that it worked as good as they claimed it would.  But still skeptical, I waited to be convinced until I tried it in the days to come.  It never let me down!  Now I clean my floors a lot of days twice a day.  It cleans great and dries very quickly.  Every time the compartment that accumulates all of the dirt and hair is black and full of dog hair.  So I know it is doing it's job.  I feel so much better that my floors are really clean and it is so easy even my kids do it.  I give this machine 5 stars plus!!!  I hope it lasts but we really test it with so many dogs.

Karyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Purchase,the United States,19-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,There is a learning curve. I accidently didn't tighten the top to the solution canister tight enough before putting it in the machine the first time and it leaked all out all over the place. So be careful to check everything. My only bad is that it doesn't get under beds. Other than that this thing is amazing and cleans great. Cuts cleaning time by a lot. I took a white rag over the floor after just to see and there was nothing.,
Debbie Connolly,1.0 out of 5 stars,Keep looking. You won’t like it,the United States,21-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Against many nay sayers I purchased this mainly because I have a ton of hard wood floors. I got it the other day and just used it. I’m sending it back. My wood floors look worse than they did when I started. All it seemed to do was spread the dirt and once it dried it looks horrendous. Very sad because I had high hopes. Guess my friends were right. I did also try it on an area rug. It did ok but nothing special. The suction doesn’t seem right either because I went through a whole clean water tank but the dirty water was not much. Maybe a 1/4 cup. Over all very disappointing,
Dana,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good suction  dirty water leaks as cleaning,the United States,20-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I like this machine.

Aly Socool,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not really made for homes with pets,the United States,14-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This product was good the first 2 times I used it. If you're looking for a pet vac, this is not it and definitely not worth the money. It's temperamental and the power will shut off if there's pet hair clogging or if the roller is stuck. The roller on mine is stuck (after only 4 uses) due to a little bit of pet hair that is hard to get out of the wheel that tuns the roller. If this was REALLy pet friendly, as it's advertised, then they would have designed it so that hair wouldn't get caught in parts that cause the machine to even work! It's so frustrating. All I want to do is clean my floor and because there is a little piece of pet hair keeping the main mechanics from working, it dies after 15 seconds. If you're going to get a pet vac, do your research. I wish had done more.",
Anne Martin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves streaks of dirt! DO NOT BUY!,the United States,1-Nov-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Unless you have light-colored floors that hide dirt, do not waste your money on this product. It leaves streaks of water and dirt on the floor even after going over the same location multiple times and cleaning the filters/brushes etc in between. I even began to manually sweep first, then go over the floors multiple times, then regular mop after to get the floors clean. It's more work! Bissell sent me out a new filter to see if that is the issue, but I doubt it given the many other reviews that mention the same result and the streaking happened during the first month of use. Amazon support, on the other hand, has been wonderful troubleshooting the issue.",One

The Crosswave makes it much easier to do a thorough clean on both tile floors, area rugs and carpets in bedrooms. I'm not sure how well it would work on very thick, expensive carpet, but this is new house builder-grade, so it works well. I'm especially happy with the strainer in the dirty water container that can just be lifted out with all the gunk and cat hair; and with the tray that cleans your brush for you. Good purchase.",
Jacqueline Cooper,5.0 out of 5 stars,My absolute favorite floor cleaner!,the United States,27-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Pros-So easy to use. Cleans well. Floors dry fast. Sucks well. Cleans throw rugs well. Easy to maneuver. Can use on hard floors and area carpets. Light weight. Separates solids from liquids. Great for quick clean up.Cons-Has to be cleaned a lot. Will leave dirty water marks when dirty. Must be sure to have roller clean. Doesn't get edges. Needs longer cord. Roller can be tricky to replace. Shampoo is expensive. (But it works very well, doesn't leave residue, smells good, keeps floors clean long) Some things must be gone over a few times to pick up or clean. Gets dirty fast. Can't do too much without cleaning it.Overall- I love my Crosswave and wouldn't want to be without it! (I have 3 dogs and 3 cats)",

First and foremost, before we get into the review, I have to say that putting the products together was easy. It l took me less than five minutes to set up the entire vacuum and its components. Within seconds, I was cleaning my kitchen floor.What came next was astonishing! Little did I know that my floor was disgusting. I picked up the cat hair, dirt, particles from food, and other kitchen mishaps. It was oddly satisfying and appalling to see how much filth this amazing vacuum picked up. Furthermore, my time sweeping and mopping was cut in half.Moreover, I have to say this product clean better than I could have ever done with just a simple mop and broom. Steam cleaning doesn't even compare to what this product picked up. I give this a million stars., I will never ever, ever clean the same way again.

It removes most spots but I occasionally use a small scrub brush for tough areas. The most important fact for me is that it leaves the floor almost dry.",
Sarah H.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,the United States,16-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It’s okay.  Keep your broom, save your money and instead buy a steam mop.In my experience:You HAVE to sweep your floors first, this thing fills up with hair FAST, so changing a few times while mopping is also going to be necessary.  Might work better if you use it every couple of days...but who’s got that kind of time!?Doesn’t clean as easily as described, be prepared to dig out mud and hair from the components.Both shampoo and waste container are SMALL.  Might work if you have an apartment or small area, but really a pain to constantly dump and refill when doing a 3 bedroom house.Doesn’t give a true clean...I’d say if you have a small area, or the time to use this product a few times a week, you’d be better off skipping.Would not buy again, hopefully they get this technology right soon!  It COULD be a real time saver!",

JILL DEARMAS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It!!,the United States,21-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I got the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro because I have a Lab who sheds everywhere and tracks mud and dirt in. My old vacuum and mop were just not cutting it. The Bissell works amazing and I’ve only had it for a night. One thing I did realize was I was missing the strainer piece for when I go to clean it out. I immediately contacted Bissell thinking it may take a while to get in touch or even have some back and forth before getting a replacement part. I sent one email and less than 12 hours later I had 2 emails from them. One saying sorry for the inconvenience and the second being a notice that they were shipping the missing part no charge.

I now love to clean the floors more often . It has taken me this long to take the plunge and buy this fabulous machine. One step and you are done. The only thing is getting under low furniture you will still need a mop for those hard to reach areas . I am amazed at how dirty the water is after . Easy to clean that part and the roller .,
DrewF!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stops working after 2 months - buyer beware,the United States,29-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,At first this product was nice.

Jamie Wilcox,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not thrilled with this.,the United States,22-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love it on the hardwood floor! Not that great on my low pile rugs. There doesn’t seem to me enough suction to pull the water out of the rug. I used an entire soap dispenser and when I emptied the intake there was only wet dog hair and debris but very little water. 2 days later the rugs were dirtier than before I cleaned them. It’s as if the soap is a dirt attractant.  It’s easy to use and does a decent job on the hardwoods so I will keep it. If your looking for something for your rugs I would not recommend it.,

Breanna Medlock,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely recommend,the United States,23-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Overall I LOVE this unit! We have a very large dog that tracks in dirt and mud and 3 small children. I wanted something for quick clean up for dog prints, chip crumbs, milk spills etc. I personally would not use this for deep cleaning, although it’d probably be fine, I just feel a traditional bottom and mop is best for that. It’s very easy to maneuver in hard floors, rugs are harder esp if you move against the fiber grain. I would definitely not consider this carpet shampooer, but it does the job well enough to keep me from having to drag out the shampooer 3-4x a week. I gave suction a 4/5 bc sometimes I do have to go over areas a few times. I have included some pics of this mornings mess. Keep In mind I just swept and mopped yesterday!",

It's a bit NOISY but I can definitely overlook that since It REALLY picked up the fuzz on area rug and the cat hair on floors and rug easily. It takes a few minutes to dismantle to clean but ultimately a very good sweeper and I'm very happy with it!,
terry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!!!,the United States,16-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It is awesome.  It gets the hair and dog prints off the ceramic flooring and laminated wood floors.  It worked on my area rug, the dog had gotten sick on the rug and it cleaned the spot up.  It works well on low pile area rugs.It is not a pain to clean.  Very easy.I absolutely recommend this product.",
Jeff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money!!!,the United States,22-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Super easy to use. Breakdown to clean the machine is simple. We probably use this 5 times a week. Stop wasting your time reading this review & get this thing now!,One
Kaila Meeker,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for cleaning floors. Great vacuum though.,the United States,13-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This works great for vacuuming hard floors and carpet and maybe if spill something on a hard floor it’ll work for a quick clean up but you’ll have to go over the area with something else to make sure any residue is taken care of…. Anything stuck on the floor or that requires a little extra scrubbing won’t even be slightly removed when using this thing.  As far as mopping or carpet cleaning it’s terrible and barely does a surface clean. I had to go back over everything with my spin jet to actually mop the floor. Don’t recommend if you’re wanting something to truly clean the floor unless you’re just looking for a new vacuum.,
misse,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Job,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"First of all, the Bissell Crosswave does a good job cleaning loose dirt and animal hair on my tile floor but does not pick up anything that is really stuck to the tile floor or won't clean dirty grout.Another thing is cleaning it after you are done a lot harder than cleaning my Hoover floor cleaner.",
Mjpeachy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Clean after every use,the United States,14-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Not a full five star because it can be a pain to clean and you will need to clean the tank after every cleaning. By the grace of god, clean this after use, otherwise the tank will produce a rancid smell your next use. Please do not let the dirty tank sit over night because the smell is terrible. If your like me and let it sit, the tank will take a few rounds of cleaning to get the smell out.",
pat griffin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely PERFECT!,the United States,20-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,There are no words to describe how much I love this vacuum/mop. It does everything in one easy pass! Saves SO much time during cleaning. I have two 100lb fur babies and this is a must have for cleanups. I’ve had the more expensive vacuums but none compare to this! Bissell has a WINNER with the Crosswave.,One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product . does what its advertised to do and more.,the United States,8-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love this vacuum, floor, and carpet cleaner in one. the instructions were easy to understand .Cleaning out the dirty receptacle a few times while doing my tile floors ,was easy .I cant believe how much pet hair and sandy grime was on my floors. I also purchased the carpet cleaner and carpet brush .Went from the hard floor to the carpet it was heavily soiled so I switched to the carpet brush and heavy duty carpet cleaner (again very easy to do ) . The carpet was clean and smelled fresh . Love this cleaner !",
Nicolette M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean floors!,the United States,2-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We got this soon after my daughter learned to crawl. I’d been stressing for a while how we would keep our floors cleaner, despite our dogs and busy life, and this vacuum has been so helpful. Instead of having to sweep, mop/wet swiffer, then wipe up the grime missed in the earlier sweeping, this does a much better job.Our floor is a color that makes it difficult to notice streaks. But the main reason I bought this was so my infant daughter could crawl on our floor without me freaking out about her crawling through dog hair and grime.It’s a little annoying to clean the vacuum after using it but well worth all the time I save from eliminating many of my other cleaning steps.",One
Shanda,4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple enough to use even a teen can use it!,the United States,24-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have 2 dogs and 3 teens in aSmall house so I need all the help I can get.This item has saved their lives.Well at the least made mine easier.It works great! Simple enough to use that even the kids don’t have an excuse not to use it. It is small, so storage is easy. I would definitely recommend it to friends. If I have any issue I will definitely edit this review.",One
Letitia Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,It WORKS!,the United States,14-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I rarely write reviews but I have lived in my house for 3 1/2 years with a fairly large first level with wood laminate floors. They are beautiful when clean which been a serious challange as I tried numerous products and all had drawbacks. Even the Norwex system which is a microfiber system which uses only water. They would streak or get hazy and show every footstep etc. Also, I have 2 big dogs and 2 cats. Enter the Crosswave. One of my neighbors mentioned it so I tried it. I have only used it once so far but what a transformation! Clean, shiny,  no footprints and easier to dry mop. I love this machine! It's early in the game so I can't speak to durability but wow, I am very pleased!",
Scott Hebert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazed,the United States,7-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This Bissell product works brilliantly and meets all the hype/great reviews.  Once you read through the instructions, it takes only a few minutes to set up before use.  Then it does it's thing.  The amount of cat hair it picked up on my visually ""clean"" area rug was insane.  I love that it's both a dry vac and shampoo vac in the same moment, switching at just the pull of a trigger on the handle.  Worth every penny!",
IRIS CHIHUAHUA,2.0 out of 5 stars,Price is too much for the little work it does,the United States,24-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Price is really not worth it. I much rather buy a regular vacuum and a regular carpet washer for anything that has to do with carpet. I like how it’s light weight, and it helps a little on the mopping, but it doesn’t have the suction power suck up all the water, in top of that, I feel the brush spinner doesn’t really scrub the floor, so it really doesn’t clean, but only spins, and sucks up the water it can.  I have to turn off the sprayer and let it vacuum for a good minute or 2 to suck up the little water there is on the door. Not satisfied at all. Price is too much for the little work it does",
heather Greer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,7-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I rarely leave a bad review for a product. But seriously I paid $300 for this vacuum and my floors do not look spotless after I am done. Specks of dirt are everywhere. I have to stop vacuuming several times because the insides get clogged with do hairs. The mop part leaves muddy streaky water all over my floors. Its easier to just use a broom and mop.,One
D Kersey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super wonderful for pets,the United States,31-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have a diabetic schnauzer and he sometimes has a hard time making it outside to pee and this vacuum is so convenient at 4 am. Much better than getting a mop, bucket of water and then wringing it out and cleaning all that up. It has also been great on throw rugs with 3 pets they track in everything.Easy to use and easy to clean. Definitely recommend.",
Rachael,5.0 out of 5 stars,This one will do a better job than the other name brand one that had been around forever!,the United States,25-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had the competitor brand for years. I had to replace them every year or so and it was annoying and expensive, but I thought I needed the green spinning scrub brush things to get the floor clean. My floors would get soaked and them it would kinda suck it up. This thing is so gental on the floors with the cloth like spinner. It barely gets the floor wet! But it is actually cleaning, and doing it well even without pre vaccuming!",
lbeeba,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purple bissell crosswave pet pro,the United States,12-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is such a great product.  I love you can vacuum, and mop your house at the same time.  It only takes a few minutes for our floors to dry.  Easy to take apart and clean.  So happy I purchased.",14
Dr. Mimi da Silva,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not What I Expected,the United States,14-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Not at all what I expected. Used it once and sent it back. Cleaning the different parts was beyond gross. Did a good job cleaning the floors, though. Didn't try on area rug. Easy to assemble, but for $300, I was expecting a better outcome.",6
Melyssa C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hardsurface messes don't stand a chance,the United States,27-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the Crosswave Pet Pro since I had just bought a new house and the builder puts Engineered floors in standard. I wanted carpet due to my allergies and pets but I was told no way. I was sceptical but now i use it daily! The pet hair filter is a pain in the tail so I removed it and just dump the contents in the toilet. I have 2 dogs, one is potty training and the other is 15 and has bladder issues. This Crosswave is a lifesaver!!",
Dawne,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horribly loud, not consistent",the United States,19-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This is horribly loud as the roller and sprayer are like a power washer on a window standing 2 ft away level of sound and the cleaning isn't great since you have to go over the floor twice given the roller and brushes make the roller not hit the floor level even with it turning.  I will be going back to previous method of my Shark steamer.  I really had high hopes.  It is easy to move but wish roller was thicker or something for less streaking and missed spots,
cheryl Williams,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed,the United States,19-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I was very disappointed every few minutes you have to empty out the dog hair in the tank. And I clean the The brush in the water and it does not get clean and if you do not take the roller out to dry it will stink really bad. You have to run the vacuum over the floors just like a shampoo very slow in order to get the floor clean it takes so long to just clean one area. I was very disappointed in this product,One
Mandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as I thought it would be,the United States,29-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted this to work great. I'm a bit disappointed in how it works. I used the cleanser that came with it and it left really greasy looking smudges all over my laminate wood floors making it looking even dirtier. With as much as it cost me, I'd rather stick to just a standard mop and separate vacuum.",
Cheryl Johnson ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bassett Hound/short hair shedding beware!,the United States,9-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Pictures should say it all! Granted I did have to vacuum at least weekly with my dog, and would get a canister full of hair, I expected better results. Most of the hair does not make into canister and that screen tool is a joke! Most hair gets trapped around the roller tray.  Frequent cleaning need to keep suction openings free of hair. Does mop ok I guess, but plain to see I will have to vacuum before mopping!",One
NancyT,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,the United States,21-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Love that it vaccums and mops at the same time.  Wish it had a longer cord.  To bad it doesn't fit in tight places.  Almost perfect,One
Lena Graham,3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s pretty and convenient but not worth it.,the United States,1-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It doesn’t do great at completely suctioning all the water off of my hardwood floors. I have to go behind a wipe with a dry cloth. I’d really prefer my machine to do all the work!I wish the dirty tank had more of an airtight lock, as you are cleaning you can really smell the dirty water and it’s very unappealing. I mean I lost my appetite for lunch! The dirt debris thing is too big and needs to have a mesh net in there in my opinion.This machine leaves me at a loss of where to dump the dirty tank water because even after removing the filters there’s still too much pet hair to just dump down a s drain without having to have another debris catcher to clean! Not fun.",
Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as Quick and simple as video looks unless your floors are always immaculate,the United States,31-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Does not clean close to baseboard. If you get against baseboard to try and clean floor it just scrapes dirt from roller onto floor. Requires you to go over and over the floor if dried spots. Does do well with pet and human hair by not tangling in the roller.,One
sad sack,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great solution for different floor types,the United States,29-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I usually hit my tile living room floor with a Swiffer either dry or wet to do tidying up.  But, when I need to clean more or deeper I pull this perfect tool for the job.  I also use it for the area rugs I use in the same room.  I do wish it had a little bigger tanks but it works for me.",
Lori Hadaway,1.0 out of 5 stars,No power and doesn't clean,the United States,9-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,The maneuverability is great  but when It has no power to pickup up dog hair or it picks it up just to spit it out in another location that's bad. We make more of a mess with the Crosswave pet pro than without it. A waste of money. We are better off with a broom and dust pan.,
Gary Oakley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous for super clean floors!,the United States,3-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this product. My floors have never been this clean. I was appalled at how much dirt came out of the grout, and off my wood floors. The machine cleans up easily and the tray is nice to store it on. One thing I would like is to have it clean right up to the baseboard on the sides and front. While your floor is spotless, it still leaves a one inch strip that is not clean,  that I have to go back and wash by hand. Overall though I love this machine!",
Eric P. Malamisura,1.0 out of 5 stars,Why rated so high?,the United States,11-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've had two of these, and I don't get why they are rated so high.  They are the biggest pain in the ass to use, take FOREVER to clean. It makes an absolute mess to clean it, its super awkward to clean it as well.  It's about a million times easier to just use a normal mop at that point.  I threw mine in the trash as I was just tired of cleaning it.",
Chickie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,the United States,5-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I held off on my review for a few months so I could give a fair review. This is a good vacuum and floor washer for homes with pets. I would strongly suggest taking it apart after every use to clean it so gunk does not harden and clog. It does a good job, better than others.",
Ami Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product!!,the United States,2-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical, I admit. I was quite concerned about wet pet hair while vacuuming. This product is amazing- Great suction for such a small unit, relatively light, easy to manuever, and clean up is far less difficult than I thought. The cleaning tray does exactly what it is supposed to. It cleans the unit. There is also a debris trap inside of the dirty water compartment that makes removing hair very easy. The pet cleaning solution has a very light and clean scent- would not bother those with allergies. Cleaning my floors with animals used to be a daunting task- not any longer!",
Lacee Amos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great on Toddler Messes,the United States,14-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love everything about this! As a self proclaimed cleaning addict, this has been a HUGE blessing. I don’t have the time to deep clean my floors the way I’d like to on a regular basis. But this little dude gets them darn near perfect and it takes basically zero time. It’s easy and quick enough to pull out and clean the floors after dinner pretty much every night. We don’t have pets… but toddlers are basically the same thing when it comes to messes. 🤪",One
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Eh not as advertised. Better options out there.,the United States,10-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Pro: Picks up dog hair amazingly. Sucks up anything in its path. Great DRY vacuum.Cons: Impossible to fully clean. Brush leaves wet streaks and dirty water on floor. Quit working after 3 months of useFinal verdict: Fine as a part time deep cleaner. Not suitable for regular use. Not durable as it quit working in December after I purchased it in September. Not worth the price.,
griman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice!!!,the United States,7-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This thing is the best thing since sliced bread. It doesn't use a lot of water but it leaves the floor clean. I really like that you're able to clean the brush without having to remove it from the unit. The brush is easily removed for deeper cleaning and drying.  The only really con that I can see is the power cord is awfully short. But the quality and cleaning power minimize the issue with the cord.,
James lahey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just use a REAL mop and a REAL vaccum,the United States,23-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The crosswave has a very hard time removing and real stain or spots from the floor. A standard mop and vacuum perform way better, the bissel does neither task very well , waste of my life putting that thing together to ve disappointed and return it. Ill never get those 30 minutes back , i could have mopped and vacuumed my kitchen in that time",
Christen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it - you won’t regret!,the United States,22-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Buy this. It is worth every single penny.  I wish I had bought it years ago and saved the time I spent sweeping and mopping my floors the hard way all these years!!  Trust me, it’s amazing.  I’d also buy an extra filter for it - I have two so I can always have a dry one ready to go.  I use this thing every single day because I have a messy eater (one year old) and I recommend it to all my friends (who also call to tell me how much they love it!).",
Joanna richards,1.0 out of 5 stars,Highly disappointed,the United States,19-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had such high hopes, as I’ve done a lot of research on which of these machines is the best before purchasing. I’ve tried everything to get the dirty water puddles and streaks to stop pouring out from it. I’ve watched numerous troubleshooting YouTube videos, I’ve taken it apart and thoroughly inspected for defects, cleaned it well, and nothing has helped. This machine was a lot of money. I expected more from it. I will be contacting Bissell.",One
Max Kirsch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Machine!,the United States,23-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"By far one of the easiest floor/carpet cleanets I have ever used! Don’t let this machine’s super light-weight fool you! This machine packs a strong punch! Cleans area rugs in no time, without completely drenching the carpet. The machine is so easy to handle and maneuver it can be easily used on stairs!  My hardwood floors looked fantastic after the first use. I should have been embarrassed by the dirty water in the collection reservoir but instead I was super impressed ! It may seem a bit pricey for such a small machine , but it is wirth every cent!",One
Jenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Saver,the United States,17-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is a time saver... we have tile floors and a big area rug, I also have a big German Shepard that sheds a lot. Before I got the vacuum I would have to sweep, pick the dirt/ hair up, mop and wait for it to dry... then take the area rug out beat it with a broom to get the dirt out and then sweep it. NOW with the vacuum, I can do everything at once. pick up the hair, mop and then just clean the vacuum. it cut the time by at least 30 minutes. In love with this vacuum.",
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great on floors - Not for furniture use!,the United States,15-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is a good vacuum as one would expect from Bassel. The only drawback is that is has no hose and attachments so while it is good on floors and rugs, it is a bit cumbersome for the stairs and it can’t be used on furniture. I need to purchase another vacuum for my tufted sofas. That is my own fault because this was not advertised for use on furniture, but I was still disappointed.",
Tammy T.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really worth getting!,the United States,27-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This really works on all my ceramic and tile floors. It is really worth the money.  The floors look cleaner than when using a mop and so much easier.  You do want to sweet up any larger things on floor, especially small pebbles or papers, but works great on dirt and normal things.",
Ashley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes you need it.,the United States,22-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Life saver in a household that is predominantly hardwood flooring ((with having to upkeep behind 3 children and two cats, one being long haired and fully white))!! Might have to hit corners with a broom first but otherwise still, not sweeping/vacuuming and then mopping and waiting. Vacuum and mop in one shot, a massive time saver. The solution dries quickly so very little wait time to have completely clean and dry floors (in my home, no greater than 5mins at the very most). LOVE my crosswave!!",
E170Flyer82,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money.,the United States,14-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes for this product. Upon using the product I've noticed a couple things: As I use it on wood floors, I have to carry around a scrub brush to remove debris on the floor, the brush on the machine really doesn't scrub unless the debris is very light.  The brush within the machine has about a 1/2"" gap on each side and in the front, meaning when you do a room you can't clean up to the baseboards.  Because of this, you have to use something else to clean around the baseboards.  This was supposed to replace a standard Bona cleaner however this is still needed to clean up against the baseboards.  And yes the Bona needs to have the ""heads"" replaced but this product requires refills for the cleaning solutions which isn't cheap.  Would recommend another product.On a positive note, with the cleaning solution provided the floors look nice with no streaks!",
Brittany H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Multi-Pet households,the United States,25-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We love this vaccum/mop combo. We are multipet house hold and we create a lot of dirt and fur buildup. This is perfect and just what we needed. Our only complaint would be that there are no attachments, we really like attachments to get into cracks and crevices but overall its a great vaccum.",

tiffany w.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it.,the United States,15-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I really love this thing! I have 2000sf of hardwood & tile and it makes clean up so much faster. My floors look and smell amazing when I’m done. It gets the majority of grime, hair, paw prints, & spills up. Sometimes on sticky spills you may have to hold it over the spot for a few seconds & let the brush spin to get it up. Cleaning it out & setting the parts up to dry when you’re done takes a few minutes. But it’s still faster then sweeping and mopping separately. I’d buy it again for sure. Shipping was fast.",One

Rock_Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Top quality,the United States,10-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love this cleaner system. It works well and the suction power is great. I love the multi brush and how it dose great on the tiles/rugs. And the hair basket catcher works great. The system dose very well to  distribute the water and solution together. The rug brush picks up a lot of hair and dirt from the area rug we have. I like that is is easy to move on the ground and the swivel on the machine is smooth and tight to get in to the right areas.

Gina,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not that great at all!,the United States,17-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Waited a few weeks before I wrote a review but I ready don’t not recommend this product.

lindalees,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING,the United States,31-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I do like this machine!  It is very useful for quick spills.  I do not like that on my huge dark brown floors, you can see streaks where the minimal bit of foam it produces is left.  I also do not like that it does not edge very well. It is amazing in the cleaning aspect, but you have to know that you will need to edge everything with another device.  I have floors that show everything so this isn't taking charge of that problem, but it very great on quick spills and fast clean-ups.  It does work well on area rugs too!",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this mopping system!,the United States,28-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have yet to find a mop that makes me want to clean my floors.  This little baby comes close.  I have a long narrow kitchen, that oftentimes not only has food mess, but dog hair as well.  This little mop does a great job of cleaning everything up.

Tiff,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money DO NOT Buy,the United States,14-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Not a fan! I wish I had purchased the Hoover instead. I love the floor machine they have but they stopped making the one we love. This one is a pain because the hard floor roller holds all the cleaner and dirty water so you are going back over your floors with dirty water. Don’t buy this if anyone in your house has long hair because you have to cut the hair out of the rollers as well. I am hoping this one doesn’t last long so I can justify buying a Hoover.

Now that we have a house that is completely tiled I was dreading mopping the floors. This thing has made it a breeze. Does a great job scrubbing the floors and getting everything off the tile.

Hector flores,1.0 out of 5 stars,This thing doesn’t work,the United States,9-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This machine doesn’t scrub the floors enough to loosen dirt you have to make passes really slow and multiple times to get anything done and this thing doesn’t clean all the way to the base boards leave about a 2-3 inches of the floor dirty because it doesn’t reach you have to clean with mop or something else anyway and machine is extremely loud,2
Jacob Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,the United States,13-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We have all hardwood floors. We grew tired of a mop that leaves you questioning whether you made it worse or not. XD ... so we moved forward with a bigger purchase and we were not dissapointed. This thing is beastly. It ate a balloon and just kept going. The fact it can clean its own bristle bar is fantastic.,
SCWSBG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you’re a mom/pet mom, do it!",the United States,12-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I’m the laziest housekeeper in the world and we have a 15 month old. I also have back problems. This is so awesome because you’re able to just vacuum or vacuum and mop at the same time. It’s also lightweight and easy to maintain. I wish I would have bought it sooner. It’s so much better than vacuuming or sweeping and then mopping. I definitely recommend!,
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,It does a good job cleaning.,the United States,24-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,If it was just a bit more powerful it would suck up even more of the cleaning fluid. Overall very pleased with the product. They also sell accessory packages that have additional brush heads and filters for a very reasonable price. I change them after cleaning so that they have ample time to dry in-between uses. Very easy to use and it comes apart for cleaning without any tools.,
Kathi Chambers,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Save your money, get the Hoover floormate",the United States,17-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Wasn’t able to find a Hoover floor mate ..... bought this to replace it and was dissatisfied with its cleaning performance.... furthermore it quit working (won’t even turn on after approximately 6 uses.

Spotman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ease of use.,the United States,6-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I just completed the cleaning of the entire first floor of my house that is all vinyl. I was really impressed with the ease of this machine and how it cleaned. I say this because I have four dogs and the in and out all day with the wet and muddy feet that it made a great cleaning. My floors look new again, but I guess I will be using this weekly with the dogs going in and out several time a day, Glad I ordered extra bottles of Pet cleaner and extra brush/rollers.",
Rhdreams,1.0 out of 5 stars,Glorified mop and broom.,the United States,25-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The idea of this product is good. The machine itself is so cheaply made that feels like it is going to snap in 1/2 right out of the box. Does it sweep crumbs, dirt, and pet hair off the floor? Sure. Does it do an okay job mopping? Sure. Is it worth $300? Absolutely not! My friends raved about this product so much that I got one but I am highly disappointed.",One
Jenny G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job!!!,the United States,23-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Does a great job! We use it on linoleum and wood laminate at least once a week. I have 5 dogs tracking in dirt and my pugs and Great Dane seem to explode with hair on a weekly basis. This little cleaner stands up to the job with no problem. It doesn’t take up much storage space. It’s easy to handle and doesn’t come with a bunch of unnecessary attachments that I’ll never use but feel obligated to keep. The only negative is that the price was a little higher than I’d hoped for.,
Kelly Morgan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not heavy duty,the United States,27-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I run a dog training program in my home. My floors get a lot of abuse and I sweep and mop everyday. This did terribly on my area rug. Made it worse. Over all impression is this does fine on my hard word but not strong enough for my rug. I feel like it’s a bit wimpy.,
Gonz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning unit investment,the United States,2-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,the unit is what I wanted and expected. It handles the hardwood floors and picks up the animal fur with ease.  Some cons is the process to set up and dismantle the unit. You can’t just grab and go like you would another vacuum.  Sometimes the animal fur when wet takes some time to pick up. The power cord could be much much longer.Pros: the tangle free roller is amazing. No longer have to cut strands of hair from the roll. The cleaning power is incredible and the formula they use leaves a nice scent behind.We’re very happy with it and are really glad we invested in this machine.,One
MichelleC - Stuarts Draft,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay,the United States,13-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Suction is great. Will not lay flat enough to maneuver under most furniture.

LYNX,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cut your cleaning time,the United States,7-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have several physical issues that makes cleaning my floors almost a full time job. I would have to sweep and vacuum one day and mop the next due to the pain I'd be in. My life has changed in one use of this machine. Its light weight and so easy to use.

Christen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont waste your money! WORST EVER,the United States,10-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"For a while this worked for me. I have a husky, I need to say no more. After a few years it started to malfunction in so many ways. Loss of suction. Then the brush roll stopped turning and I had to beat it up and take it apart to get it to work again and the brush roll never turned again. I quit and am about to toss it. Not worth the price. I honestly hate this product. Wish I could get my money back.",One
Alexandria Darnell,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t recommend,the United States,6-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I read all of the reviews for this vacuum and was very excited to buy it. I’m very disappointed and think this is a HUGE waste of money. It doesn’t even pick up everything with the vacuum, it more or less just moves it around. The mopping function of it leaves huge streaks and doesn’t get everything up either. Do your research and don’t waste your money on this vacuum.",
Angela Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best present ever!,the United States,27-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"My granddaughter asked for the Bissell CrossWave for her 21st birthday.

19kilo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,8-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,LED lights already broken after 4 months of use. It struggles to get the water from tank to floor now. Suction is already dramatically dropped. It's not worth the space it takes up.4 months and already breaking? That's not a good product.,
K Petty,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’d buy it again.,the United States,20-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It cleans well and is easy to assemble and use. My only complaint is that the beater bar gets wrapped up with my long hairs very quickly. I know there is another machine that supposedly solves that problem but I can’t afford two machines. I would love it if they would make a special beater bar to fit this machine that will solve the long hair issue. This machine has good suction and cleans well without much effort. I’d buy it again.,One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for people with back problems,the United States,27-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love this cleaner, if you do your part and sweep your floors first then it dose an even better job.

Gloria Kudera,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean floors well,the United States,15-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Love this cleaner and thinking of getting one for our granddaughter when she graduates from college this May.

T.B. Turcotte Jr,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Noisy, but works good!!",the United States,17-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Opened the box and assembled very easily.

Daisha Little,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,the United States,24-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Oh my goodness. So I was walking out of my bedroom when I dropped my almost empty coffee cup.

I stood there in shock unsure of how to go about cleaning (I rent and was terrified of having to pay to replace the carpet) when I remembered we had just purchased this a couple of weeks before.

Suzanne Bucaro,5.0 out of 5 stars,That it really works. Great suction. Really deep cleans. Easy to assemble.,the United States,2-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Both my daughter in law and I are over the moon with this bissell. I am a loyal Bissell buyer. I wanted this but it was beyond my finances. I'm on social security. My son said get it. We are so glad he paid for it for us. I wish Bissell had either customer appreciation or a pretty decent discount for us on social security. This is so worth the money though. Highly recommend. Corded always for us.,

I’ve been cleaning hard floors in the house twice a week with it.  I can’t go back to my old form of mopping, my floor has never been this clean!

Jennbear,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wouldn’t waste the money,the United States,8-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,So this was good the first time I used it.

Ernest Woodward,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,the United States,15-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Absolutely love my cross wave pet pro. I have laminate floors thru out my entire house. This mop cleans up the normal dirt and grime with ease as well as the stubborn messes like syrup and the mess of a 2 year old.Light weight and easy to setup and use. The only thing that I wish I could change is the dirty bucket size. With 2400 sqft of laminate floors I had to empty often. Also you literally have to take the machine apart when done to clean everything. But other then that I love it and my floors are now super clean!,
Ashley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have for fur baby homes!,the United States,7-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Been using this for a few months now on my laminate wood floors, bathroom tile, sealed concrete basement floor, and area rug. I’ve even used it for quick cleaning in my carpeted bedrooms and I have zero complaints. My house has 4 floors about 1500 square feet each floor and I can get each floor done without refilling and only emptying twice. Dry time is seconds and if it’s taking a little while go over it without pressing the water button and it will suck up the access water no problem.",One
blasher1313,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ok floor and flat area rug cleaner,the United States,20-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It’s ok. I was hoping for a more powerful suction from the machine.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful,the United States,12-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum leaves my floors messier than if I wouldn’t have used it in the first place. If I vacuum my whole floor (without water) there is still pet hair EVERYWHERE. I have to use a different vacuum first and then this as a mop and the mop function leaves the floor streaky, messy, and spreads animal hair everywhere. The only thing it is good for is cleaning dog pee out of carpets. Biggest waste of $300. I used a different brand of floor cleaner in it 1 time and it ruined the vacuum because it was too sudsy. Now every time I use it there is a streak of suds through my house. I have tried to clean the brushes, I have cleaned the tank out. Still a mess. Do not buy this vacuum if you have animals.",

D S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cool product,the United States,7-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Definitely a cool product but it doesn't replace a regular mop or vacuum. It doesn't have a detachable hose to get into corners and things like that. When mopping it cleans floors well but isn't really made to clean up huge or stuck on messes. For regular vacuuming and floor cleaning it works great though.,One

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good product.  Over priced.,the United States,11-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Over priced.  Does a fair job on my tile floors but on my first use I had screws fall out from the under carriage which were immediately vacuumed up.  Fortunately, I have a lot of small screws handy.  A little thread lock and back in business.  Should be in the $150 price range. It is probably $50 better than the Hoover I had that cost $99.",
Sabrina,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,the United States,6-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Not impressed. It doesn’t seem to have a good flow of water when washing. I have to pass it twice on the same area in order to get the water to clean enough. Also, the filter gets clogged pretty quick and I had to clean it twice because it started making a louder sound and water flooding was going out and not be able to absorb it without cleaning the filter.It’s small and takes more time than expected. PS: I don’t have pets.",
Lea,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE!,the United States,4-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This thing is the love of my life. I use it almost daily. Having a dog and an 18 month old your floors get dirty and stay dirty. This cleans them right up and gets them looking shiny new everytime.,One

Alyssa Maynard,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for pets that shed a lot,the United States,7-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So after 5 minutes of mop/vacing, the tube was clogged - not the vacuum, the tube going into the vacuum. So I cleaned it and started again. Then the doghair got in the way of the filter chute and the filter got full of dirt. So I cleaned everything out and scrubbed the filter and let 8t completely air dry... huge mistake apparently because after that it smelled like feet, armpit and wet dog... in my opinion, not worth the hassle. My shop vac does just as good, and its cheaper. Wasn't impressed with the mopping feature either.",
Informed Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best floor cleaner I have had!,the United States,11-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love the maneuverability a first machine.  Was so surprised by the suction power.  You can really tell how it is working by looking and the dirty water container, and I thought my floor was clean. Yuck!  We have to new puppies so I needed help in keeping up with their little accidents!! Lol. This is so easy to use and then to have the tray to set it on the cleans it up after you are done is wonderful too!  Love the slight fresh smell afterwards.",
Mike O,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost Perfect, better than a mop or Swiffer",the United States,1-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Works surprisingly well. A lot better than a Dyson and a mop and Swiffer like I usually use. It seems like it would be better if it had more suction. But it did the job well. I liked how easy it was to clean out and disassemble. I wouldn't want to pay full price for one. But I think it was a great value for what I paid for it on Prime Day. I am satisfied with it and it seems well made.,
Hollie,3.0 out of 5 stars,On the fence,the United States,2-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"At first I thought this was the best invention ever. However after many uses, it doesn’t deep clean like advertised. I have laminate floors and it leaves streaks and doesn’t clean up well as I thought. It is great for use on area rugs. The scrub power isn’t what it seems, beware.",
Sydney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for everything,the United States,19-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love this thing. I had no idea how gross my floors were. I use it to clean my area rug and hardwood floors every other day or so. It picks up everything. I've even used it on our carpeting without the spray and it works pretty well for that too.,
Lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,My house has never been cleaner.,the United States,2-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I switched from a Bissel vacuum and deep carpet cleaner to this all in one machine and am super happy I did. I use it almost every other day and my house has never been cleaner. It makes everything smell so fresh. And it cleans up pet hair in a flash. The only downfall is that it must be cleaned after every use and waiting for the parts to dry is time consuming. I don't like that the wet and dry debris is mixed in the dirty tank.,
KettleCornwall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best. Thing. Ever.,the United States,6-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've always used the bucket and mop and hated it.

Cameron,1.0 out of 5 stars,Makes more of a mess than it’s capable of cleaning,the United States,24-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It takes forever to vacuum with this because it kicks back whatever is near and it has terrible suction power. Incapable of getting small pieces of debris like small pieces of foil, paint chips, or eraser dust. Also stops working randomly sometimes and I'd have to unplug and plug again.. it also once exploded all over the place. I dont even know how this would happen because i didnt lift it while the motor was running. Anyway save urself time and trouble and go with something else.",
KELLY,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW! BEST $300 Bucks I've Ever Spent!!!,the United States,11-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I've been looking at this for several weeks before deciding to buy. Powerful suction, smaller tank, but surprisingly it lasted a lot longer than all other floor cleaners. If you're on the fence, BUY it!!! I've just started and I can't believe how much crap was all over my floors. A little heavy but I need the exercise. You must clean it out right after you finish, which is sooo simple, takes like 1 minute.",
Paula Porter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans my wood  floors very well.,the United States,23-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,There's nothing that I dislike about this product.

It was exhausting sweeping the whole house and then mopping. This vacuum definitely does a great job of combining sweeping and mopping. We don’t have any children yet and have a hypoallergenic dog, so that is my perspective for this review. This vacuum does not work on dried mud spots or any dried soiled areas really.

I have used the Bissell at least four times since i purchased several weeks ago & not a single time after I finished did I feel the floor looked clean - there were still visible paw prints all over the floor.  I live on a farm and have three dogs that go in and out (as they please) and with the rainy weather they track in wet little paws all day long.

I’ve never had a vacuum get as easily clogged as this one.  I have to take it apart at least twice to unclog it every time I vacuum. The part where it vacuums up is so narrow it doesn’t take anything to clog it hardly. ( see pics )  For this to be sold as a pet vacuum is unbelievable to me. Don’t waste your money on this.

Kathy F,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great in Pet Friendly Home,the United States,15-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have used this several times now since purchasing.  We are a pet friendly home and it does great.  Easy to use, Easy to clean, Not that loud, and really does a great job.  If there is something dried or stuck on it only takes a few seconds of hovering on that spot, and it is GONE. Even when my floors looked clean, I use this machine and the dirt in the waste water is amazing.  It really really cleans far better than a mop.  Only issue is that it doesn't get up to the edges of the room very well.  Leaves about a 1 inch or less strip along the baseboard that you can't do.  But well worth the money.  5 stars!!",2

Lara ,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,the United States,15-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love this product. The thing people need to remember is that after each use you should be cleaning it out well.  I think the people complaining that it was great in the beginning and then later it didn't work as well probably just put it away dirty every time.  It really only took me two minutes to clean and empty everything after using it.,One

Just be sure to empty the dirty water after each use. I’m glad I can sweep and mop with one device now!",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great so far!,the United States,27-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I just received my Bissell PetPro. It was easy to assemble and get started. I was worried about it’s use on my new Laminate flooring due to the risk of water damage. The great news is that it leaves very little moisture behind, so no chance of damage. I am very pleased with this first time use. My floors look the best they have since we installed them. Yay!It does not suck up debris on the backward stroke...only when moving forward with the hair and dirt in front. That is the only reason I gave it a 4.",One
Thomas F. Rosselot,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent machine,the United States,28-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I received this yesterday and used it today!  Awesome!  We have two cocker spaniels and they shed...a lot!  This Bissell did a wonderful job! With 2 dogs coming in and out, with dirt and sand constantly,  this really did an outstanding job.  I'm very happy with the purchase.  As to cleaning the machine, of course you have to take it apart and clean it and let it dry.  Not a big deal and I'm no youngster.",
CH,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Too loud, can’t stand it after 10 mins",the United States,24-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It’s a hassle using it. For almost the same amount of time I can mop the floor with a regular mop and listen to some music or a podcast or have a conversation. The bissell  needs me to get everyone out of the area I am mopping, wear noise canceling headphones and still be irritated after 20 mins of usage.A Miele vacuum is so much more silent (I had issues buying it from Amazon but their customer support was straightforward) even in the carpet mode.2 stars because it works and was able to remove stains and remove all the water. Hardly saw any pooling.",
Jessica,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay,the United States,22-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It’s definitely quicker than the long drawn out process of sweeping then mopping. I wouldn’t say it’s a deep clean though. It leaves muddy streaks. And muddy prints of whatever the pattern on the bottom of your shoe is. We have a dog door and our farm dogs come go as they please. This isn’t enough for us. For dogs And floors that aren’t so dirty it would probably be fine,
Michelle L Cavallero,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t rush just let the machine do the work.,the United States,24-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Love this! Being able to mop and vacuum at the same time without the heat to warp my floors is a game changer for me. No more doing everything separately! The first time you use it you will have to clean it out more than subsequent times as you have no idea how dirty your floors really are lol.,
Kristin Tosello,5.0 out of 5 stars,"2 dogs, 1 kid, great choice!",the United States,5-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is easy to use and does great at cleaning our floors. We normally vacuum before we use it but if there is any dog hair left behind, it picks it up with no problem. When you’re done it is easy to clean and store until next time.",
Aaron,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best invention ever!,the United States,31-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We have two large dogs and 4 boys that track everything imaginable into our home with wood floor through out the entire first floor. This thing is amazing! Not only does it make your floors immaculate but it cuts the cleaning time in half. We were always vacuuming and then moping and it would be an all day event. Now we just fill it up and go. I would compare it to the microwave in how it’s revolutionized cleaning floors. Truly awesome!,
juju,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,3-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"does everything as described.  It's not something I would/ I use for everyday cleaning, unless it's spill or pet accident.  But great for regular cleanings.  For quick daily cleaning I use the 3 in 1 rechargeable, which I also love.",
Bailey Biesterfeld,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum & mop in 1 !,the United States,8-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Best vacuum/ mop out there.I have 2 French bull dogs that shed their tiny little hairs all around my laminate floors and it used to be such a pain cleaning up until I got the bissel pet cross wave.The only gripe or annoyance I have with this product is having to disassemble and clean the dirty water compartment which really isn’t that bad lol.I have the corded one and it’s wonderful:),
Reba Hollie,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must if you have pets!!,the United States,13-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This machine is wonderful! I have already talked my sister and daughter-in-law into getting one as well. We all have pets. Not only does it vacuum your carpet and shampoo out stains but it cleans everything off your floor as well as scrubs it. I’m getting rid of all my other vacuum cleaners and mops!!,
Justine,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bissel Crosswave Pet Pro is not worth the money,the United States,7-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro leaves streaks all over the floor regardless of the type of cleaner I've used and how many times I've gone over the surface.  The cleaning head is approximately 1-1/2 inches from the sides of the machine, resulting in a dirty strip of the same width along the baseboards  and any furniture. I should have bought another Hover Floormate and saved myself $100. I deeply regret this puchase.",One
AddyK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty awesome!,the United States,17-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love this so much!!! I gave it a 4 on deep cleaning Bc I attempted to clean a pet pee spot on my carpet and while it did clean enough that there was no stain, it still had a slight pee smell after it dried.  I will say that the description says it’s for cleaning rugs and hard wood. So this is perhaps why.  It did a wonderful job on my hardwood floors!! Fab!",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,the United States,30-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"LOVE this! I’m a clean freak to begin with and this sweeper is perfect for a home with 2 large dogs and a Himalayan cat! Others mentioned it was messy and left streaks... i guess if the floors were completely filthy to start, that may happen but it is very easy to clean and go over the area again if necessary. That hasn’t been an issue for me though! I definitely recommend this to anyone with hard floors! Can’t wait to try on area rugs!",
R. S. Murphy,3.0 out of 5 stars,I returned it.,the United States,17-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The sweeper worked ok. I was hopping Insave water by not wet mopping but it takes flushing parts with water to clean the sweeper so no win there. And, while cleaning part of the sweeper I got electric shocks. Not a good sign. I returned the sweeper.",
Carl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,10-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I like the idea of this machine being a combo vaccume cleaner and floor cleaner. I like that is was very easy to figure out how to use it. It can be used in small tight places on the floor. Does a superb job of cleaning my floors.,One
Stephanie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t do it.,the United States,5-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I don’t know where all the good reviews come from. I hate using it. I wish I had went with a different product or even got just a regular vacuum. I do not use the “wet” part of the vacuum at all. Every time I use it, it leaves nasty dirty water all over the surface I try to clean. I’ve even swept and mopped the area I use it on (I know, kinda pointless to have the machine when I’m doing it old school anyway) with the same result. No matter how much I clean it there’s always debris left and IT STINKS. I’ve ALWAYS cleaned it with water and dried it with paper towels. There’s always a mildew like smell.I. Hate. It. I don’t want it and I would NOT recommend.",
CynM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,the United States,19-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this floor cleaner. I have around a 1000 square feet of LVT in a dull brown. This flooring shows everything and always looks dirty. This Crosswave, while it does not make the floor look new, it makes it look clean. It is easy to use and it amazes me how much dirt, dust, sand, hair, etc that it removes from my floors and throw rugs. Thank you Bissell for a product that delivers exactly as advertised!",
Shelley K. Nelson,5.0 out of 5 stars,So easy to use!,the United States,26-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love this vacuum/electric mop.

Nicole,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,16-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this with high expectations. We just moved into a home with hardwood floors, I couldn't wait to use it and clean the floors. It leaves wheel marks and doesn't pick up all of the water and leaves the dirt and water behind I plan to use it one more time, if it continues I will be returning it.",
SRB NY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this,the United States,4-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I previously had a Hoover which broke and leaked after a few uses. I hesitantly bought this one based on reviews. I am extremely pleased. It is very maneuverable, does a great job and works very well. The capacity of the waste is somewhat small, so I needed to empty more frequently than I would like. Highly recommended.",
LPP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best mop ever!,the United States,17-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This Vacuum/Mop is a god send.  It scrubs my floor so clean and with 5 dogs running around it’s needed. The suction is fabulous and it dries, super fast. It’s easy to get around everything due to the swivel handle. It’s met all of my expectations. There is only 1 complaint and that it doesn’t get right next to the wall or cabinets leave about a 1/2” gap but I can deal with that. I can’t rave about it enough.  It does well for carpet spots to.",

megan baskin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't even last a year,the United States,20-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,When I first purchased this I loved it. It did such a great job cleaning my floors and area rugs. Super easy to clean after each use . However I was just now using it and it cut off and decided it wouldn't turn back on. Of course my return window is closed for Amazon. I guess I'll be contacting the company. I haven't even had it a year and it's already broken.,2

It’s so easy to clean all of their nasty messes. This thing picks up all sorts of residues, pee, smushed poop, hair, and eliminates smells. Great on linoleum and tile. Make sure you clean it regularly! I also use one brush for the dog messes and another to clean the rest of the house.",
Laney,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s okay,the United States,7-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Definitely not a vacuum for bigger carpeted spaces - but it’s not advertised to do so. However it doesn’t pick up big clumps of hair well - I have 5 pets and thought a pet pro would be beneficial to no avail. I also have laminate wood floors which it tends to leave streaks if I use the wet vac. However ultimately it does pick up small pieces of things like pet food or cereal,
Kelli W,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money!,the United States,26-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Thank goodness for Amazon's awesome return policy! This thing isn't worth the heafty price tag. Used it twice and it left dirty streaks, lots of water in different place. I felt like all it does is push around dirty water!

I know stuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, incredible.",the United States,18-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had to play around with various different cleaners because I have very dark floors but this is honestly the best thing I have ever purchased for my home. My teenagers love it and my adult son took over for me “mid clean” and said it was so therapeutic.Great cleaning and awesome suction, it leaves the floors clean. I used to sweep, vacuum and then mop my floors. This is all in one and picks up more than my previous method. Finally, this item was $30 cheaper on Amazon than the big box stores (and those punks wouldn’t price match)...Bought 3 as Christmas gifts too!",
shirlyn zimmer,5.0 out of 5 stars,ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY CROSSWAVE!!!!,the United States,18-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I absolutely love my crosswave!! I recently installed laminate throughout my house and only have carpet in my bedrooms. The crosswave is so easy to use and cleans so well!!The only draw back is it doesn't get into corners well but thats the only negative I have experienced. That being said to me its still worth it cause I can clean all my floors quickly and efficiently.,
Caroline Dickey,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is great!,the United States,21-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We are remodeling an old house, and decided to do wood floors throughout the downstairs, and area rugs.  The vacuum is adequate, def got the rugs clean and was easy to empty.  The cleaner on the hardwood floors worked great.  The little screen catches the hair, larger debris - pine needles etc. in the dirty water tank so it doesn't go down your drain. So far it seems like the perfect machine for our needs.",
Andrea Nield,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love this vacuum!!,the United States,12-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We have three dogs and even though our Roomba vavcums everyday when I do a deep clean I have to clean the vacuum out at least two or three times to keep up with it. It cleans magnificently so it's totally worth having to clean it out a little more to get the job done as well and as quickly as I am able to now. It's worth every penny!!,

Now it’s February and have to say I am not as pleased. After every use I clean and wash everything, With having 2 small dogs and cat it can get crazy. When you go to use the next time, there is a smell that comes out. Works good on small carpet areas but does not dry fast the suction does not pull up to much water the brush is still wet. Not good for stuff stuck in cracks.",

Nancy Williamson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great!,the United States,13-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have an eleven month old 98 pound German Shepherd dog which is inside and outside. So bringing him in after he has been outside in the rain leaves the floors with wet dog prints even after trying to dry him off.  We purchased this a couple of weeks ago and I have to say that my floors have only been this clean when they were new.  This product works great for fast cleanups and weekly cleaning.  We have all hardwood and tile floors so mopping wasn't doing the trick, especially since you are only mopping with dirty water.  I use it on the area rugs and they are very fresh looking now.  Very pleased with this product.",
Sylvia Hammond,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Saves time, excellent results",the United States,11-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This is a big time saver for me. Floors are just as clean as when I clean them on hands and knees. It’s also much easier since I am no longer a spring chicken. Rarely do I need to stop and loosen up an extra dirty spot. If is far superior to swiffer type mops.,
Madra,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Do It,the United States,27-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It was a toss up between this and Tineco. I opted for this. My mistake.

tonirexx,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really gets the job done,the United States,6-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love this! It does a fabulous job cleaning floors. We bought a new house from a lady who had 12 large dogs and this really gets the job done. It even cleans the drool off the hardwood, a substance I had tried every product on the market to get up.

Having hard wood floors with a large long haired dog and small children, and a backyard that holds a lot of water/mud, this machine has been a life savor! I was SO IMPRESSED that the dog hair did not get tangled around the roller. I thought my floors were getting clean before until I saw how much this machine cleans up. I also have chronic back pain and this made mopping my floors so much easier on my back. Quick tip- if the floor is still a little damp, just go back over that spot quickly using just the vacuum and it dries a lot quicker.",One

If you have pets, this is the machine for you! I've only used mine twice, and can't believe how well it cleaned up cat hair in both my floors and area rugs. It's lightweight and easy to move around. Has great suction power, and just glides on any surface. It gets down deep and picks up anything/everything leaving your floors and area rugs so clean, they're like new!I've had other floor cleaners (didn't clean rugs) that were good, but the Bissell out-matched anything I've ever used before.

I absolutely love it!  It cuts mopping time in half,  and my house is all tile with two kids and pets.  My floors are sparkling clean now.  Totally worth it!Doesn't get in corners very well,  but that's OK,  because I don't have to mop!!You do have to clean it pretty frequently if you're picking up a lot of hair,  but I'm okay with that.Now I wish they would make one that does walls! :)",
Luke Henderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW,the United States,26-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’m almost kinda embarrassed at what this thing picked up...I didn’t realize my floor was that dirty. I have a gravel driveway, so the tank content was a mixture of gravel/sand and my dog’s hair.It seemed to work great on tile and carpet. Disassembling was easy, but also gross due to my dog’s hair. It’s also extremely light compared to most vacuums, so it’d be a great gift idea for an elderly person.",
eclectic,5.0 out of 5 stars,This little machine is a God sent !,the United States,3-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Power to sweep, power to scrub floor  in one machine !!  I have a long haired dog. This is the first sweep that works with all his hair. It doesn't clog up the machine. Dog hair has already killed 3 reg. sweepers, not this one !!

Diane L. Cobourn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,1-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have two floors with divets in the pattern, they collect dirt horribly. A regular mop, Swifter mops, or a steam mop just don’t get them clean. I’m getting to old to get on my hands and knees to scrub!

Michelle Wentworth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does Exactly what it says it does!,the United States,21-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This thing is exactly what I was hoping it would be!  Suction was great - I have 550 feet hardwood floors in my kitchen and living room - and the cleaning solution lasted for the entire duration.  Really, really impressed with this little machine.  Excellent maneuverability, the roller picks up dog hair and dirt they track in - I have 2 big dogs - not to mention the mats I have on the floor were easily cleaned with this machine as well.

We have been using this machine for about two weeks now and I am very happy with it to this point. I am a little nervous because I had seen some reviews saying they Can poop out after a couple months but I am hopeful. As of now, it does a fantastic job and I am quite pleased!",
Jacquie Allison,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would buy again,the United States,10-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It is definitely convenient to have the vacuum paired with the wet mop feature.  On one tank of cleaning solution I was able to clean most hard surfaces of our 1st floor.  It can be a little time consuming to clean every piece of the cleaner after each use but the convenience is worth it for big jobs.  I wouldn’t recommend this for small quick clean ups.  I am glad that I purchased this product.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,the United States,26-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Great process easy to use onceYou clean it once it doesn’t take that long the next time. Overall I saw reviews for streaks, you have streaks for about 5/10 min while it dries after that no streaks it’s a great machine. Floors look wonderful and doesn’t feel like you just push around debris with a mop",
Tricia Evangelista,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heavier but super effective,the United States,9-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I broke my previous generation of this product so this was a replacement. It is definitely heavier than the old one and louder so I imagine it has a stronger motor. The suction is intense especially when using the rug feature. It doesn't swivel as easily as the old one did so I have to do some strategic maneuvering to get into corners and around furniture. The trade off is worth it because with the other one I always had to go over lines at least twice to get full coverage - not with this one though! Overall it saves a ton of time and I would definitely recommend.,One
LMW,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs to be disassembled and cleaned every time,the United States,10-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Works well, but you really need to clean it up very well after each use or it can get stinky the next time you turn it on. The tube between the receptacle and the brush tends to get clogged with dog hair. I usually have to clean it out in the middle of the job to keep suction going well enough- but this is pretty easy to do. I usually sweep before I use the vacuum because that tends to keep the vacuum’s suction longer. It’s really easy to disassemble and clean which makes it worth the cost in my opinion because it’s much  easier to maintain. Overall it cleans well and if I do this a few times a week I feel like my floors stay really nice.",One
Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life saver,the United States,5-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Reason 100 why I love this vacuum so much: I dropped the extra large full bottle of Valentina hot sauce and it shattered into a million pieces. I picked up the big ones by hand but wasn’t sure how I was going to clean the rest. I pulled out my vacuum and it sucked up not only the hot sauce but the glass and cleaned my floor at the same time. I love this thing! Took my cleaning time and reduced it by hours. It took me 20mins to clean the whole mess and my family is safe because the glass is gone!,One
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,It worked fine at first.,the United States,5-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I actually hate this vacuum. I think it cleans pretty good. At first. You have to completely disassemble it in between every use. I did not see much coming up into the dirty section, and it leaves behind a mess. In my taking it apart all of the time, i now can’t get it to go back together. This vacuum was just ok for the first 3 uses. Hate that i spent so much money on it.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth the money!,the United States,1-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We’re very pleased with our new Crosswave.

By the time I would get done mopping it was already dirty again and the whole process was so time consuming. I waited a couple weeks to really let the hair and dirt build up and used my new Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro to see how it would tackle the job and boy was I impressed!! My house feels and smells so clean no one would even know there at 17 dogs here :)",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thumbs Up Bissell,the United States,30-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I clean houses everyday. I rate this particular cleaning tool as super handy ! The suction power is proficient for fine dust as lower price vacuums are not. The extra cleaning rollers and the easy replacement is lovely.  I like the pet hair screen in the dirty water tank, again handy! Emptying the tank is a breeze. My only suggestion would be a hose and crevice tool attachment for corners and tighter woodwork cleaning. Thumbs up on the quality of the soap product. To say  that I am very happy with this product is no easy task. Good job Bissell!",
MamaBair0824,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!,the United States,22-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,My mom has had one for awhile now and I just had to get one.

I work full time and have a baby, 4 cats and a puppy. This vacuum has saved me so much time with cleaning! I no longer have to vacuum and then mop after. I wish I would have gotten it sooner! The only complaint is you can’t lay it down very far to get under furniture. Definitely not a deal breaker tho!",
joe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I hoped for,the United States,8-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’ve only used it once, but it did an amazing job on my laminate and vinyl floors. I had to learn I didn’t have to spray so much unless I got to a drool spot from our English bulldog lol. This has saved my back! I absolutely dreaded doing our floors and it made it so much easier. I was able to do our living room, dining room, kitchen, tv room and small bathroom without having to dump the dirty water or add more cleaner/water. It’s easy to take apart and clean as well. I absolutely love it so far!",
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,could be cheaper,the United States,28-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I do love it but not as much as i wanted to. It has good suction power and saves me so much time and energy its worth it. PLus the amount of dirt it picks up blows me away every time. My floors feel great afterwards i just wish it worked better on stuck on messes.,
Jackie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best light weight vac/mop ever!,the United States,3-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Have tile kitchen/Dining room and bathroom floors and a big dog. Would clean them on my hands and knees. This light Bissell Crosswave Pet vac/ mop is the BEST. I could not believe how clean, it got the tile floors with ease. What a saver on my body I'm62 yrs old and now look forward to cleaning my floors. It also does my throw rugs at the same time. It's  the best!",
Sean Taylor,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unit stinks no matter how much we clean it.,the United States,21-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Terrible product....its a sweeper that uses water/cleaner. Hard to get clean stinks not suitable for pet cleaning....better for sweeper/accidents that happen once in a long while. No matter how much you clean/disinfect the unit mildews and stinks and can’t clean it. Only thing we use it for is dog hair and general floor sweeping/mopping.,One
Erin Vail,5.0 out of 5 stars,The ONLY way I’m able to keep up with my puppies and wood floors!,the United States,14-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We recently remodeled and got all wood floors, and for two puppies as well. I tried three different vacuum cleaners, a regular manual mop, and a steam mop. There was no way to keep up with these floors and puppies! I had nearly given up when this product was recommended to me. It gets all the sand and mud and pet hair up all in one swoop, while mopping and shining! Please note: it doesn’t get dog food kibble up, that’s too big to fit under the vacuum. It does get ALL sand and dirt up! I love it!",
Nichole,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING PRODUCT,the United States,8-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We bought this for due to having a great dane who drools all over everything, and it is STICKY!  This machine works wonders!  Takes the leg work out of scrubbing and cleans our wood floors and tile floors just as good as they would be if we were on our hands and knees. Would purchase again in a heartbeat!",
Elisabeth the Great,1.0 out of 5 stars,Became a piece of useless junk in just over a year,the United States,17-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This completely died after a bit over a year of use (and not heavy use). It would not turn on anymore.  I took it to my local repair shop and they ordered a new handle/wand where the power switch is to see if that would help. Nope. Upon further investigation, the motor is seized up and the circuits are blown and it would cost more than $200 to repair. Repairman didn’t recommend fixing it. I am beyond disappointed that this is heading to a landfill. I would be happy to pay for a product that worked and LASTED.",
MommaK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do you really know how clean your home is?,the United States,25-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love this machine! I have 1 cat and 1dog both are inside animals.  I would vacuum mop and sometimes scrub my floors and carpets. I thought all was clean until I used my Bissell Crosswave Pro all in one. What a surprise. I am now wondering if my babies are possibly one problem that is connected to my many sinus infections.  My house smells fresher and is noticeable cleaner.  I use my Bissell at least once a week.  So glad I decided to get it.,

Brandy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for lots of dog hair,the United States,16-Oct-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I like this vacuum a lot but it could be a bit better in terms of suction power.

It works well though, best I’ve used to date while having a husky with tons of dog hair to clean up during shedding seasons.",3

B. Struwe,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a time saver,the United States,28-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I wasn't digging the vacuum cleaning first, then mop after. I thought this would be a time saver. Not in the least. Having to go over and over a spot, and the water is hard to distribute evenly so it dries in streaks - and then the disassembly and cleaning of the entire unit and the 8 parts - not recommended.",
LindaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life!?! Real time saver!,the United States,2-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This little machine is amazing! Instead of first sweeping then mopping, I’m doing both at the same time! I went from laminate floors to area rugs by the push of a button. No having to change attachments or anything. Dog hair? No prob. Dried fast as well.",
M Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to Clean Floors,the United States,23-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love the Crosswave Pet Pro. It makes cleaning my tile floor so much easier. I have two dogs, and this has a strainer in the dirty water tank that lets you easily lift out the trapped dog hair and other debris.  It works kind of like a carpet cleaner, since it has a dirty water tank and a clean water tank with cleaning solution in it. the rolling brush cleans as the cleaner sprays onto it. It sucks up the water very well, so the floor dries almost immediately. I am using it on a tile floor. To clean the brush head thing, you just put the Crosswave into its stand, and pour in some water, then turn it on. the brush spins and the machine sucks up all the water, cleaning the brush head. It comes with 2 brush heads, so you don't need to buy any extra. It also comes with a small bottle of cleaning solution. They sell a 3 pack on Amazon that has enough solution to last for years! I am so happy with this machine, because I hate mopping my floor and so many others left sticky residue. After using this machine the floor just feels clean, and no residue. It is a miracle and so easy to clean my floors now.",6
M. Buetow,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,6-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this new machine.  It does as promised, vacuum and wash at the same time.  It is fairly lightweight too.  Easy to fill and empty.  There is a bit of cleaning required when emptying and putting away, but it's no big deal.  It was a bit pricey, but worth it to me.",
K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have Wet/Dry vacuum!,the United States,8-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Highly recommend this vacuum! I have a new puppy who likes to track mud and dirty in the house in my floors and rugs. Super easy to assemble right out of the box and comes with two small bottles of the cleared and two brissles. Picked up all the dirty and cleaned my floors and carpets really well. My one rug is extra thick and sheds a lot so had to clean out the suction duck but overly easy to use, super powerful, and easy to clean & store. And huge time saver both vacuum and mopping in one tool now!! Will Not got back to anything else now! Highly recommend for anyone with furry friends:)",
Cheryl Clark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheryl,the United States,27-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Omg love this. Have linoleum and wood floors. We had swept and mopped before it arrived.  The water in holding tank afterwards omg. We have 3 shih tzus and live on a farm. Amazing so worth it.,

s. skip,1.0 out of 5 stars,The hype is all talk,the United States,8-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I was so excited to get this considering it’s all I’ve seen on Facebook. It is absolute trash. It sucks as a vacuum and it sucks as a mop so I don’t even know what the purpose is. I’d much rather sweep and then mop and have it done right the first time then have to do something twice and it still not be done properly. Don’t waste your money on this way over hyped product.,
Lisha,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can’t believe how clean my floors get.,the United States,27-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This is the best product for floor cleaning.

Todd Camas ,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great invention,the United States,2-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If you have hard floors, this is a time-saver!

Paige,4.0 out of 5 stars,"all in all, time saver",the United States,7-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’m 9 months pregnant and this saves me so much time already. My entire house is tile and rather than sweeping & using a swifter mop that just pushes cat hair around this saves my back.  Some spots on the floor you do have to go over a few times but it vacuums well and doesn’t leave the floor wet. A bit harder to move it over area rugs but it does the job and the multi surface solution smells great. Happy wife, happy life!",

Shannon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste the money!!!!,the United States,6-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I bought this has a mom of two under 2 and a dog mom and its not worth the money biggest regret ive had on a expensive purchase in a long time. I kept trying to give it a chance but ended up disappointed. Its more work keeping it clean that it would be to clean the original mess itself the hard way. There been a smell coming from mine after the first use. This is still after spending money to replace the filer clean the bin and replace the roller and just about anything else i could clean.,
Ariana Heppenstall,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best results on wood floors!,the United States,18-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Awesome results for my hardwood floors, doesnt work well on carpets. Decent on tile floors. I add fabuloso when using on tile and wood cleaner when using on hard wood floors.  If you use a carpet cleaner first then use the bissell it cleans better on rugs. Have to clean the filter out after every use for best results (we have 3 dogs).",4
J R,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t use mop feature with dog hair,the United States,29-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I like this for a vacuum.

I would return it but can’t even though it’s less than a month old.,
NAC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy!!,the United States,9-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This was a great buy!!! I previously purchased a rug cleaner and it is too heavy for me to use.

Michael Kuchieski,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as described,the United States,2-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Received the Bissell Pro today. Was very easy to assemble and directions were clear. I thought my floor was clean until after our first cleaning with this and the water was very dirty. Did a great job vacuuming and mopping. The scent of the cleaning solution was very enjoyable as well. Cleaning the device after use takes about 5 minutes but it is easy todo. Some reviews said it left too much water, I disagree the floors dried very quickly because only a little water was left on the floor. Only used it once, but it was as promised, excited to clean my floor again.",
Makenzie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,1-Sep-21,Crosswave Pet + Pet Formula,Verified Purchase,"Definitely wish I would’ve gone with a different vacuum. It would be okay if even the floor cleaner aspect of it worked as well as I hoped, but it doesn’t which makes me not feel like it was worth the money at all. I do have two dogs, so there is always dog hair that gets stuck and the vacuum clogs when I just vacuum the rugs so I ended up getting another vacuum and basically just use the crosswave for cleaning the rugs every few weeks",
K P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent  for homes with pets.,the United States,11-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I wish I had found this sooner. Living in a dusty climate with two Australian  shepherds  and o e Golden retriever,  4 horses and a cat.. we track  debris and dirt in constantly.. so far this is the easiest  and quickest way to cleanup.. arrived with the drying tray cracked  but I'm sure Bissell will replace it.

Carrie ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good Vacuum,the United States,1-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The suction on this vacuum is outstanding! I think it works fantastic most of the time, but the lack of being able to get underthings that are really short is annoying. Also, when you have a really hairy floor (which I do from my dogs) I have a hard time cleaning up all the hair without the vacuum blowing it around or just pushing around dirty, hairy water. I have to sweep when the floor first if I do not vacuum everyday because the Crosswave cannot handle too much hair.",
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's amazing.,the United States,20-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I honestly didn't realize how incredible this cross-wave was going to be. Amazing concept. I just love, love my machine. My floors have never been cleaner. Drying time is so fast, with no streaking on my hardwood floors. I even use it on my basement floors, which as most know cement takes forever to dry, but not now, within 15 min. my floors are dry and clean. I highly recommend this machine.",

Kathy Chelini,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dissatisfied,the United States,29-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I’m disappointed in this product. While it does a great job in cleaning the surface of our tile floors, there is no cleaning action for the grout.I washed a 5’x5’ area of ceramic tile flooring on three consecutive days to determine if there was a cumulative effect. There is not. I can get floors as clean with a broom and mop with less cost and less clean up after. (There are a number of pieces that must be removed from the unit an cleaned before storing.).",

I've seen lots of bad reviews regarding dirty water, lack of suction, puddles of water, and streaking.  To be honest I was leery of purchasing because of those reviews. My advice, thoroughly read the instructions before you start. I have not experienced any problems at all and regarding the dirty water...

John Rodak,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Performance & value,the United States,17-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Skeptical at first but the Bissell is now my favorite household cleaning tool.  The option for wet or dry sweep / mop and the flexibility to move from hard floors to carpet with a trigger of a switch makes cleaning efficient and effective.  Clean up is easy and a little disgusting, as the Bissell cleans and picks up so very well.

Shannon F.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful suction, not as advertised",the United States,21-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Whenever I use the ""wet vac"" portion of it, all the hair clumps up in the tube. The tube, by the way, is like the width of a nickle, so it's prone to clog. Before EVERY TIME i use it, i have to unclog it. The times I don't use the wet vac, i still need to unclog it because fur and dirt get caught in the tiny suction tube....It's not user friendly; my hands always push the liquid trigger by accident; the wheels don't rotate with ease. There's no attachments either.The only thing this is good for is creating stress.",
Jeepster,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,the United States,15-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Easy to use but could be easier to clean. Love the one step vacuum and mop. You have to almost completely dismantle the crosswave to clean after each use. I can live with it for the convenience of cleaning my floors.,
SD,4.0 out of 5 stars,Upgraded,the United States,4-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This product appears to be an upgraded version of their old Bissell Flip all in one for hard floors.  Product works great and encompasses those things we wished the old Flip had.,
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,A vacuum and Wetmore less powerful than both,the United States,15-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This item is very cool. It's nice to be able to not only sweep up and vacuum the kitchen or living room carpet but also do some floor stain and carpet stain removal.  The only problem with this item is the fact that due to its combo it neither excels as a vacuum or shampooer/Wetmore. Additionally you essentially have to clean it out after every use or the smell becomes horid. I would recommend this product for purchase, just be aware of what your paying for.",
mary karns,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money!,the United States,1-Nov-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This product worked only worked for 3 months. It works okay as a vacuum but not so good as a mop. It was definitely not worth the price to only work for a couple of months.,One
Lorei B,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE THIS MACHINE,the United States,22-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I have always wanted one of these and didn't think it would be worth the money.  It is worth every penny.  I have 2 huskies that spend most of the time in/out all day. So very muddy paws. The vacuum works great and the rollerball is great.,
kaylena M feuti,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t buy again,the United States,26-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I like it.. my floors are clean but I wouldn’t buy it again. Pretty easy to clean but the roller/brush underneath stays wet for days. It makes a strange noise after having it for 2 weeks, you can’t get way under the table because it’s not that “flexible” if you know what I mean. Also this is mainly for hard wood, wouldn’t recommend for large carpets. And I wish it had a hose for floors and corners and such.",
Well Meaning Plant Killer🥀,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,the United States,21-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This thing works so well. The only thing I don't like is that you have to rinse everything out and off before storing so it doesn't mildew.It cleans my vinyl, tile, and laminate flooring fantastically. I'm glad I invested the money in this. Also I purchased open box from Amazon Warehouse and saved over $80 and it was brand new even though the listing said acceptable.",
samantha leade,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy set up, easy to use, works great! Even on really soiled/ sticky floors from food messes",the United States,11-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I wanted something that would be a one for all, tired of sweeping, mopping and then drying and still seeing spots. This machine works wonders, I love that I can alternate dry/ wet and work on all of my floors with one tool. It doesn't leave streaks and the floor dries quickly.",One
Siblian Mableton,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very handy but clean up pain.,the United States,28-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I like the action of suction and floor cleaning. With 4 dogs it's a Godsend. I do however dislike the fact of the clean up. The rinse tray does not completely dry. The filter has to dry longer than a day and smells musty.,One
C Moreman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t work,the United States,4-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Don’t waste your money, it doesn’t suck good and you end up with water everywhere, today is March 4th and today was my first time to use and I can’t even send it back for a refund",One
Angel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works as described,the United States,28-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"It works as described but I can't imagine that anyone can use this all the time and ditch the mop and bucket. It's ok for in between cleanings, is easier on my back but takes more time than the old fashioned way! It gets into corners really well though.",
Josh H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought as a gift, she loves it!",the United States,28-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Bought as a gift for my significant other. She absolutely works it. Said she would recommend to anyone for cleaning hard surface floors. Works fantastic for pet hair.,
Jen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money if you have tile floors,the United States,7-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was really disappointed. It does a poor job at cleaning tile. Suction seems minimal.. it is pretty maneuverable but did not in anyway deep clean my floor. In addition, the buttons to switch from hard floor to area carpet are located at the top of the handle. So it is easy to keep hitting these and accidentally turning it off. Ignore the hype and save yourself the money and storage space. I wish I could return it",
jennifer Walsh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wet fur equals clumpy, fur clogged hoses and head",the United States,6-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Even when I empty the reservoir after vacuuming, I still end up with the hoses and head clogged with clumps of wet fur that have now caked over inside the hoses. I push lint and dirt around with it now and it barely sucks anything up after less than six months of use. I only have myself and 2 cats in a 600 sq ft house and I vacuum 2 times per week. Waste of money.",
Alexa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for pet hair and messes,the United States,1-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I love that's it seems to be picking up all the dog hair. And leaves a nice smell with the cleaning solution included. My only complaint is having to take all the hair out by hand before dumping the dirty water. I dont want to clog the sinks or toilet. Otherwise so far it does the job and I like the self cleaning tray,
Jennie Belanus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life saver for pet owners!!,the United States,13-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"These are a necessity for homes with dogs and lots of hard surfaces! HUGE timesaver to vacuum and wash in one step. I used to vacuum/sweep and then wash the floor with a norwex mop but that takes a ton of time and elbow grease.It suctions all the way to the wall, but the washing part doesn't get to the last 1/4inch to the wall, so doesn't hurt to wash the old fashioned way on your hands an knees a few times a year, but other than that it's seriously the best invention ever!Only thing is I wish the cord was a bit longer.",
JohnnyT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m glade I ordered it, and also got one for my mother.",the United States,2-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I was a bit concerned over the purchase as I read a few negative reviews about the machine. The reviews suggest the machine doesn’t clean well and can break easily at the roller.I’ve used the machine twice a week for two months and this machine works great. :)I had two Hover hard surface machines which are two to three times larger and this machine blows them away.,
Stephenae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job great without leaving you a dirty machine to clean after!,the United States,3-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Wonderful product! Lightweight, clean like it says. I have 4 dogs that track in mud and dirt, was so tired of cleaning and wrenching mops!, then drying them. The tray is a wonderful gadget, you can clean the rollers then stand them to dry. They thought if everything! I did buy the corded one as battery life on the cordless would hinder my time recharging in cleaning day. Love this, I recommend to all with pets!",
Angie Garrison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great and so much easier than mopping and wringing,the United States,1-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I have dogs and hair collects on the floor and then there is the accidents.  This is my most favorite cleaning machine ever. It comes with a water dispenser that can have Bissell cleaning solution added.  Water can be ejected as the suction of the solution dries the floor.,
Caroline Cunningham,1.0 out of 5 stars,I regret buying this,the United States,25-Oct-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Leaks dirty water all over the floor when I try to clean with it.

Melodie Bryce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,the United States,21-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Awesome is all I can say.  This is the mop/vacuum of my dreams.  My friend told me about it and I decided to purchase one.  It is absolutely amazing.  I have all tile floors and I no longer have to vacuum or sweep before I mop, it is all done at the same time.  This is so easy to use, I just love it!",
Rosie S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as advertised,the United States,20-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This is advertised as being for pets.  I have a dog and 2 cats in  my house and it does not clean the area rug like it states UNLESS you vacuum first!  On my bare floors it leaves streaks no matter what I do!I would not recommend this to anyone who has pets or lives in the country.,2
Michaela,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loses suction after one use,the United States,31-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Worked great the first time, then once I removed the canister to clean and dry it, and returned it to the vacuum...all suction was lost. Worked ok as a vacuum but would not suck up the water. Don’t waste your money. Just bite the bullet and buy a good vacuum, carpet cleaner, and a steam mop (for flooring).",
GallopinGin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sucks....Not in a good way....,the United States,7-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Worked great until it quit spraying.  It quit at random one day and I cleared the spraying heads with a pin as suggested, checked tank, as suggested.  It quit.  Rather expensive to just quit.  Looking into warranty.",
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great idea and works well initially but I would not recommend,the United States,3-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This vacuum worked really well at first but after using it for a month it is no longer as effective.  It is good for light mopping but does not do a good job removing spills or dirt from the floor.  The vacuum works well but does not get into corners or under furniture well because it will tip up when you lean the handle back past a certain point.  Even though I've cleaned the brushes per the instructions each time the rollers already smell like wet dog.  Wet hair gets trapped in the hoses and you have to clean it out.  Great idea and works well initially but I would not recommend.  Unfortunately my return window closed 3 days ago or I would be returning this for a vacuum only.,One
Anthony,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought my floors were clean, then i bought this",the United States,26-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I bought this because i have a puppy and with potty training there are definitely accidents. I want to ensure I'm really cleaning up her accidents. I use a wet jet and also hand wash my floors. I did my whole apartment and wow, the dirty water tank was wore than i was expecting. I wish this were a little cheaper but I'm glad i bought it. It doesn't take a ton of solution in the machine and i bought a full sized bottle. Bissell also gives you a coupon for a three pack at 50 percent off.",
eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best item I've ever brought no regrets,the United States,10-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"At first I was not at all impressed until the day someone stepped in ""it"" and left ""it"" stains all over my tile. And as easy as turning on the vacuum this machine out shined. I didn't need no mop or bucket. I wasn't grossed out by the smell or the thought of having to wipe ""it"" off the floor with a paper towel. I simply used my bissell crossover pet pro and in less time it took me or stepped in ""it"" and didn't bother to clean it up. I was done and the smell was gone. Thank you bissell truly a great product",

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value and works great.,the United States,15-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is the best floor cleaner I have ever used.  I have had 2 back surgeries and other issues, I can use this with out any problems. It cleans great, is light and easy to use. You can vacuum your floor and shampoo it at the same time. It cuts your floor cleaning in 1/2 of the time.  I have wood, tile and stained concrete floors, it work great on all of them. I would recommend it.",
Lane,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Maintenance Cleaner,the United States,27-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This vacuum is great for maintaining hard floors between deep cleans. Do not expect it to get stains.We still have to vaccuum before using this machine but it beats getting out the bucket and mop. We can now go longer between deep cleans.Only drawbacks are it is still corded, thought I was getting the cordless version and post use clean up process.The post use cleaning process is essential or you risk a musty mop roll. This step I dislike the most.",
Taxgal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best vacuum/mop ever!,the United States,10-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical that this product would take care of both vacuuming and mopping my dark cherry wood laminate and my ceramic tile, and not leave a cloudy film behind.  I've tried other products and they always left a film behind so I have had to go behind and polish.  THIS MACHINE IS AWESOME!  It saved me at least 4 hours of cleaning time.  I am impressed and would recommend highly! Thank you!!!",One
Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,I feel my floors are clean when done,the United States,3-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I like the machine for my kitchen floor. We have lots of traffic in that area and I do feel it does a good job. I always sweep or vaccum before I use it. I feel it cuts down on the cleaning of the machine. I wish it had a little better suction. Also have used on my area rugs for a nice refresher.,
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible purchase. With 2 dogs it's not worth the money,the United States,21-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have 2 dogs, so we were thinking a ""Pet Pro"" purchase would be good. The only thing good about it is it moves around nicely. Dog hair does not suck through, it's messy to clean because hair gets stuck in the tube. The brush cleaning at the end doesn't suck the water through, so that's messy too. I thought this would make floor cleaning easier, but it's not even close.",
Ga mom ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product !,the United States,21-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If you have tile, hardwood and rugs you will love this ! I used to sweep, vacume mop then sweep again. Now I clean my floors in half the time. You must clean it out after every cleaning do not store with dirty water or it will smell. I found the easiest way to clean is to put a little water in sink. Place vacume into water and let it run for 20 secs. Unplug and clean out dirty water holder and put dry roller back in ( it comes with 2 rollers). Very easy .",
Futurestarmom,3.0 out of 5 stars,Had to Use,the United States,17-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This cleaner spits out dirty water when it should be sucking it up. Further, when I took the top off the area to clean the roller, I can't snap it back on. I'm afraid if I push too hard (which I should not need to do) it will snap the plastic.",

Swivel head makes it very easy to “steer” around corners and under furniture. Simple to convert to a hand vac that also has great suction.

Right now I have five dogs at my house and I am constantly having to clean my hardwood in my area rugs upstairs.  Yesterday I took this out of the box so easy to put together and use and I had the whole upstairs done in no time😍😍  this is an item that I highly recommend but remember it is good for hardwood floors and area rugs that would be thin area rugs.  Because my whole upstairs has no carpet just rugs and Wood it works perfectly !! I am a sales person and if I could go out and sell these I know I could sell every single what I showed someone how to use it that is how highly I  would recommend this!! In fact when I woke up this morning and walked out and saw how clean my floors,runners and rug  living room were I actually smiled and thought best purchase I’ve made in a long time !!!  I have been looking at these for a while but I did not like the colors they were in I know that is weird but when it came out in purple, my favorite color this month it was time to invest and I am so glad I did kind of mad I didn’t get one of the other colors earlier this would’ve save me a lot of time over the last few months.",6
angelxwilliams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it!,the United States,18-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love this thing.

Amy Bullock,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money,the United States,6-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,All this does is streak the floor. It makes mud puddles out of dust.

Ginger S,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,1-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I am very unhappy with this product.

Andrea,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough scrubbing power or bristles.,the United States,22-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I purchased this product for an area rug that was hardly soiled. Slight discoloration from high traffic. Nothing major. Hardly has any bristles for scrubbing/cleaning. Mostly Soft fabric on the roll for cleaning.  Resulting in poor cleaning and far too much elbow grease. Found myself using alot of cleaner and repeating the process multiple times for it to just turn out “okay” Haven’t used it since. Disappointed in the money I spent. Good suction and maneuvering.,
Julie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome! If you have pets it’s a must have!,the United States,25-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This is a game changer! I have 2 dogs that shed terribly.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my carpet permanently smell - I want to return,the United States,6-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had high hopes for this. The vacuum suction works well on hardwood floors. But the carpet portion - with pet hair is so high maintenance. The first time I used it on the carpets, it took my dog's hair and spread the smell everywhere. For the past 3 months I've been working with vinegar to correct it. And the brush collects pet hair and it gets all tangled. It takes forever to clean. It was such a waste. I want to return and want a refund.",One
BeesVees,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is NOT like a vacuum cleaner you can use, unplug and put in the closet.",the United States,23-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I wanted to love this but I don’t. I needed something handy to use daily and this must be emptied and cleaned after each use.  It was accidentally left uncleaned for a few days and when I opened it to clean it it was already filled with mildew. Then after a thorough cleaning it still smelled like mildew. I would return it if I could.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you have pets..,the United States,29-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Floors and rugs are so much more difficult to keep neat and clean with pets. My rug in my room seemed hopeless. I used this vaccum on it and it feels and looks like I just put it in!!! And the scent from the formula smells amazing!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone floor or rug it does both!! It makes it look like you don’t even own pets!,3
Destiny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,the United States,17-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I can’t believe I didn’t own one of these sooner. I live on a farm. I have children and a husband that don’t always take their shoes off and dogs that sometimes run in with muddy paws. As you can see in the first picture, our rug was horribly stained. I was about to pitch it until I used the crosswave on it. I am so happy with the results. I couldn’t believe how much of a difference just one cleaning did. The two dark spots you see are just wet spots where I had worked on that area a little more. I highly recommend it.",
Hazey1,4.0 out of 5 stars,Most Amazing Purchase Ever!  3 Dogs,the United States,12-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Where has this been for the last 20 years?!?  We have 3 dogs, 1 cat and 5 children.  Every morning I would need to sweep up the fur and dog kibble then mop the floor (2 of my little dogs invariably pee over the edge of doggy pee pads).  With this, I just plug in the wet vac and clean up all the fur, dog kibble, pee and any other dirt or dust!  So easy and the floors look amazing!  The cleaning formula they recommended is wonderful and smells so fresh.  My floors have never looked better.",

Mary E. Edwards,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome. I LOOOVE it.,the United States,24-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It really cleaned my (laminate) kitchen floors. Usually the groves required an extra mopping but not any more. I went on to clean my hardwood floors and once again I was very impressed.  I really love that it sucks up the water too (no more wringing mops😀).I just wish it held more water but that would defeat the light weight.,
duqu,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not waste your time or money,the United States,22-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Waste of money. It does not do what it says it is designed to do.

In order to keep my home clean, I must vacuum and mop my floors daily if not twice a day. This machine makes that so EASY! Suction power is amazing. It is GREAT for daily clean up.

Lu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it so far.,the United States,5-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Wow.  It really does work.  Smells great.  The rollers actually come clean in the cleaning cycle.  It is easy to use.  It is lightweight and steers well.  It picks up tons of dog hair and dirt.  It sits in the cleaning trough.  The rollers can dry in the cleaning trough.  Very compact and great for a small place, but it will clean a large place.  I used it on area rugs and tile.  Love it.",One

Korin B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny!,the United States,19-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This has been the best purchase I’ve made in awhile. I saw people raving about it on social media and it was sold out everywhere. I finally found it in stock and jumped at the chance. I have two dogs that shed worse than I do, one that still has accidents inside and it cleans my carpet in no time. I don’t have to be weary about my carpet feeling gross or my apartment smelling like dirty dogs. If you’re considering buying this vacuum, do it!",
Masonizer Mom,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as amazing as it sounds,the United States,4-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was expecting amazing results but became very disappointment in the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro.

Don't be.  I have had at least 12 Floormates in as many years.  I run these machines, whole house, every single day.  Received the Crosswave today and immediately went to work.  The cleaning is absolutely superior to that of the Floormate.  Take the plunge!",2
Robin S. Semple,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Pet Mess Cleaner,the United States,10-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We have 2 dogs that constantly shed and slobber and generally make messes...they're rambunctious.  The Bissell does a great job with quick cleanups and that less often deep cleaning.  It breaks down easily for easy cleaning in the sink and goes back together just as easy.  Highly recommend.,
Alex L.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Giant waste of $300,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I have had this since 2018 and every time I use it (I avoid when I can) it reminds me that this is the worst waste of money I’ve ever spent. I honestly hate this machine. The brush is virtually useless during the mop function. This is basically a way to spread Febreeze water all over your floor. End result looks horrible on semi gloss wood floors.,
Amber,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer!,the United States,20-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Clean up is easy and leaves my floors clean and smelling great! Cut my floor cleaning time in half!

Eric Lenington,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far Great!,the United States,2-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have only used it a handful of times but so far it is great!  I have tile and laminate wood floors throughout.  It isn't meant to ""scrub"" your floors but it definitely cleans mine!  I love that it vacuums and mops all in one! I have taken it apart to clean it and had no issues!  I wish I would have had this in my previous house that had all tile floors!",
Tamara,4.0 out of 5 stars,Will never go back to sweeping,the United States,6-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I loveeeee this bissell!!!! It cleans so good and leaves my floors feeling nice after everything dries. I would def  recommend this small if you have a house that’s all wood floors and some light carpets in your house honestly saves me so much time because I really don’t sweep anymore. I just do it all at once and I have a very busy toddler and cleaning up after dinner is such a breeze I literally use this mop every single day and it really gives you an idea of how clean your floors are because the water becomes so dirty after you mop for the first time and you think that you did a good job at first!,2
Norman Portnoy,1.0 out of 5 stars,This does not clean well at all.,the United States,5-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I used this for the second time today and had to wash the floor by hand afterward to get it clean.  I am past my return time so I am stuck with it, but I would definitely not recommend it.  The floor was not unusually dirty, just normal pet dirt, dirty paws, slobber, etc.  Shortly after I purchased it, our dog went to the happy hunting ground, and we just got a new dog which is why it’s only the second time I’ve used it.",

Was sweeping and mopping daily, now does it all at the same time and do not have to do daily.  the first time used I made me think I was just spreading the hair and dirt around, I could not believe all it picked up.  If you have pets and hard floors this is a must for your home.",
Cody,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Time saver,the United States,26-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,All in all a great buy. We still have to scrub the high traffic areas once every few months but it used to be once a week or so. Works better than any other floor cleaner we have tried. We have 2 big dogs and kids so the floors get dirty. This is a time saver for sure.,

Robin Ney,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome cleaning!!,the United States,22-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love everything about the Crosswave Pet Pro!....EXCEPT that it doesn't get close enough to the baseboards....about an inch away.

MMA,1.0 out of 5 stars,Regularly Clogged,the United States,6-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We bought this product about a year ago. On a regular basis, it looses suction power, and mostly the underlying problem is things getting clogged in the tight passage near the base. Once clear, it regains power, but this problem happens more often than it should. Quality of wet cleaning of carpet rugs is below acceptable based on the results we have achieved thus far.",

Karen in Georga,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but leaves an inch at walls it doesn't reach,the United States,22-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I have two active dogs and this works great.  I couldn't give it 5 stars because on my white tile I have to go around the walls with a mop.  The cross wave leaves about an inch from the wall it doesn't reach.,
Emily,1.0 out of 5 stars,More of a weak vacuum than any sort of mop.,the United States,6-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It does not clean very well at all for mopping. Vacuum is good for hardwood but is okay at best on area rugs. No matter how thoroughly you clean it or dry out the insides it still smells awful when started back up and horribly musty. Please don’t waste your money I truly regret buying this thing.,
Robin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Performs as expected.,the United States,3-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Really like that there are 2 tanks, one for clean, one for dirty solution...not just spreading dirty solution on the floor. Deep cleans the grout and could be used to clean up a spill.",

Brittani Perkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing for mom of 4,the United States,11-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I cannot be more appreciative of this equipment.

A. Beaman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,the United States,4-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I love this thing. It is loud but it sounds like a vacuum. So it’s not a quiet mop. It picks up all my dogs hair. It works really well, I have a one story house and it’s all tile threw out except the bedrooms. This is a back saver and definitely cuts out time sweeping. The only cons I would say are getting really close to the wall but if you turn it to the side and get the sides it works to!!",

Terry Weiland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saves time with super cleaning power.,the United States,17-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I loved how it eliminated the need to vacuume first the cleaning was power was wonderful.

It did a great job of mopping and vacuuming. It is a bit narrow so it would take a bit longer to do a floor compared to a regular vacuum but considering you are doing both mopping and vacuuming at the same time, it probably still saves a lot of time. I found it easy to clean and easy to use and set up. I would recommend it for those with pets for sure. It picked up a ton of hair!",

Having had other carpet cleaners before where clean up was wet, messy, smelly, and gross, I SO APPRECIATE the easy clean out.  It is *nearly* a touch free process.

Lisa Carlin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bissell Crosswave,the United States,4-Feb-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"The machine came and we put it together based on  common sense.

Thanks so much.",2
Jeff,1.0 out of 5 stars,absolute waste of money,the United States,26-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,absolutely awful. the plastic pieces dont snap in place. they pop off while youre using it. the brush that spins does not and gets stuck. it just wipes around the dirt and does not clean anything and then you have to clean the machine afterwards ? not worth $380. and it stinks.,
Caitrider,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for floors with deep crevices,the United States,15-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I have all hardwood flooring and some scatter rugs around the house. This vacuum is great for hardwood however it will leave a streaky residue. The solution also smells amazing.

Jtomage,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall satisfied, just sucks to clean up",the United States,17-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It works well especially for apartment / condo living but it is a pain to clean up especially the pet hair.The cord could be longer.,
Joann Westfield,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it!!,the United States,17-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Not impressed especially with all the good reviews I read. It pushes the dirt forward instead of sucking it up. The head is to tall to fit under cabinets. It leaves white spots on the floor when mopping, where the liquid spits out. I would not recommend especially for the price!",
Wendy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good suction and ease of machine.,the United States,28-Feb-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I used mine for my long hair Maine Coon cat and Labrador which sheds quite alot. I use quite often for my pets are messy eaters.  Suction is good and ease of machine is great.  Used on ceramic tile floor and wood.  Cleanup is generally easy.,
Megan Robinson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,22-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Not worth the money. The vacuum doesn't even pick up anything off my rugs. I tried to spot clean a small stain on a rug and the crosswave was useless. Now it won't charge after one week!,
BDH,5.0 out of 5 stars,game changer,the United States,11-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I don't take the time to write a lot of reviews, but I love this vacuum. I used to vacuum with my Dyson, then dry swiffer, then wet swiffer. This vacuum takes the place of all of those AND gets the floors and rugs much cleaner.

I had been impressed with it cleaning my tile floor-vacuuming and mopping at the same time. But it just cleaned my hardwood floor, wet cleaned my area rug AND my couch!

And I will probably never use them again because this thing is the bomb!!! Would buy a thousand more times! Very happy!",2
Berna Woods,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,the United States,8-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I couldn't be more pleased with the easy use ability. It's lightweight but strong suction. Especially like how easy the wand removes for corner/edge cleaning.,
Kirk E. Morehead,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life is messy - clean it up,the United States,19-Aug-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,My house is 99% hard wood floors and occupied by many cats.  This is what I have been looking for.  You can mop a room at will with no pre-planning and your knees will thank you.  Make sure you clean the waste water out each time.  It will get stinky quickly.  I also need to understand how to pull the nylon brush out to be hand washed.,
Diane S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,the United States,4-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have used the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro twice since buying it in September, both times for my white cotton area rug.

M. O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy,the United States,12-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This product works great, but can’t fit into some corners because the brush is so wide. Also, the cord isn’t very long considering the size of the tank, so 4 stars for maneuverability. It takes several times going over different types of foodstuff on the floor (small flacks of jello takes 4-5 times going over). So, 4 stars for deep cleaning. It does sweep up all of the little bits of things such as hair and grass, so 5 stars for suction power.It is easy to clean and very easy to use.",
CrystalAnn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,the United States,23-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,works great but does not make my floors shinny like everyone else and will not get close to the base boards. but it does make for quick work,

Jordan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Siberian Husky,the United States,4-May-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"If you are looking for something that does a deep clean, I suggest a different product. If you are looking for something to help pick up dog hair dirt because sweeping just does not seem to be doing the job this works great. I have a Siberian Husky and when she shedding this is amazing for getting up the hair. I say again if you're wanting something to deep clean you're going to need a different product.",
GeGe,4.0 out of 5 stars,What I like and dislike about Bissell crosswave,the United States,5-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I used it on wood floor.  I have 4 yorkies so even though it says you do not have to vacuum first I did.  It did a very good job cleaning floors except it does not get close to walk.  The only thing I really dislike is cleaning the machine so I only use when know I am going to do entire house.  If it was easier to clean I would use more.,

Prime Member,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for Lighter Cleaning,the United States,31-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,An excellent cleaning aid but not perfect. I’d pay more for a quieter one—it’s really loud! It does a decent job of vacuuming small debris and does an excellent job of removing the cleaning water. Really like that it doesn’t mix the clean and dirty water.,

Shiane cleland,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,the United States,23-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Do not buy had less than 2 months and it broke then had to go they Bissell for a replacement took several weeks to get my replacement and 6 phone calls to get it because they would constantly say it was on the way then when I would call they would say it hadn’t been shipped due to the rep not filing something,
Marjorie Kalugyer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with purchase,the United States,24-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Love the purple!It maneuver easily, light weight to move around.

Worked exactly like the too good to be true description said. Could not be happier with this thing. I won't dread moping the floor anymore.

damnhippie1969,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is amazing !!!,the United States,21-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I waited for a while before unpacking this, due to surgery recovery. It cleans, scrubs, dries. Light weight (I'm in a wheelchair). My only suggestion is to not use it to clean up cat litter. The litter turns into a paste, could possibly clog up something. No streaks on my laminated floors. You can't go wrong with this time saver.",One
Kayla Paeltz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly easy and fast!,the United States,9-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This product is amazingly easy to use and great for pet hair!

brenda bernstein,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it:  4 animals ( new puppy last week) Cleaned up So Much Dirt and Pet Hair!,the United States,24-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I read a lot of reviews online and yes this product was more expensive but I love it---I just added a new puppy to my dog and 2 cats and it's too many pets shedding not to have a great solution without calling a housekeeper .  It was not too difficult to assemble ( I am not exactly the best at that) and when I use it I am stunned at how much hair and dirt came up and it was easy to maneuver and also handle the stairs.  The stand up floor anchor makes it easy to store in my closet.  The cost is higher than some but not as much as a Dyson.  I justified it realizing that I don't need someone to clean up the pet hair as often and so it will pay for itself.,
Cindi Lund,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,the United States,11-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have a parrot and they spread feathers and seeds and chewed toys, etc.  Then I also have a dog so there is hair.  I sweep up the larger toy shred from the bird first but then this vacuums up seeds, dog hair, etc. all while mopping the floor at the same time.  And then I can go right onto the area rug too with the same thing.  Has cut my cleaning time in the family room significantly.",
Nancy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for pet urine.,the United States,16-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Love this Bissell cleaner. I use it on my hardwood and kitchen floors.

Sherrie Wright,5.0 out of 5 stars,My best friend!,the United States,7-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have 8 cats and a dog the size of a small cat.

Darlene Bess,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not so easy,the United States,11-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I'm elderly and I bought this because I thought it would help me. It is far more trouble than useing a broom and a mop. The cord is very stiff and always in the way. I also have trouble taking it apart and putting it back together. Unless you are young, I wouldn't recommend it.",
Vicky Greb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t live without when you have pets.,the United States,6-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Love the product! Easy to use. Easy to clean up after. On the rug it is harder to push but maybe that is why is cleans so well. It pulled up more pet hair than I new was buried in the rug fibers!  I prefer this corded version. I would like to see a slightly larger dirty water container. Never the less highly recommended!,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am so happy!,the United States,27-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have been wanting this for a while, I have an old home with hardwood floors, a big messy dog, and a big messy husband. This is as easy(if not easier) to operate as a vaccum cleaner and yet it cleans my floor better than a good sweeping, vaccuming and mopping! I am so glad I purchased as we were having a baby, now I am not worried about a clean floor for her to play on.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Regretting purchasing after a few months,the United States,14-May-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I loved the idea of having something that could sweep and clean the floors at the same time. I really really wanted to love this but it has a lot of flaws. Although it’s somewhat a pain to clean, I’m okay with this since the 2 in 1 design ideally would save a lot of time otherwise. The biggest issue is that once the machine gets dirty (which only takes one use), it is close to impossible to clean fully and you end up getting streaks of dirt all over the floor when you’re trying to clean it which is pretty counterintuitive. It’s definitely not worth the money unfortunately.",One
marie34,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,the United States,7-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Besides dumping the dirty water all over me after the first use (a mistake only made once), worked great.

Jim Silvania,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a quality product,the United States,24-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,After having a Dyson it spoils you. Not enough suction power and not well designed or built; the plate above the brush will not stay attached thus causing you to lose suction and not performing as advertised. Therefore not worth the money.,
Tami Williams,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money!!,the United States,12-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I was hoping for a little help with cleaning up after pets but this seems to create more work.  It leaves streaks of muddy water on floors…even vacuumed floor before using it.  Have to go back over floor with swiffer to clean up what was left behind.  Seems to leave area rug more stain than before.  Not into writing negative reviews but this is very frustrating!,

Bob Carpenter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have pets, this is a must have.",the United States,26-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,It is better than advertised.  We use it about once a week on our hardwood floors and you wouldn't know we had three dogs.  The cleaning solution with fabreeze is great and the crosswave leaves the floors with a shine.  The old hardwood floor looks like it was installed with our new hardwood that is only a couple of months old.,

Dawn Albrant,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,the United States,23-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is not worth the money, it does not do either function well and it's very easy to unintentionally hit the water release button while vacuuming which results in a muddy mess. It does not vacuum well but if you are wanting it strictly for mopping the floor it's good, however there are cheaper items for mopping that would be equal or better then this expensive machine.",

Adam Pendergrass,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It was amazing at first, now I just use my mop and handled broom.",the United States,13-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,This vacuum was amazing the first 10 uses or so. Now it seems to just put hair back in different spots as you mop. Tried cleaning it real good and now it seems I have to move it back and forth extremely slow to get any improvements and some spots you have to go back over even slower and repeatedly.,
Jonathan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible,the United States,26-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,We loved our previous items. This product was reviewed and researched. The problem came quickly. When you use the wet cleaning don’t keep using it to clean anything else. It clogs and then within a room will simply smear the dirt. We kept giving it time but if I could return for half our money I would. Still like Bissel but this combo stinks!,

Sheryl S. Lam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can sometimes get clogged and start clumping hair rather than picking it up,the United States,22-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,For the most part I really like this vacuum. My biggest compliant is that sometimes the middle of the spin brush in the head of the vacuum can get pretty clogged and then instead of picking up any hair it rolls it up into clumps and leaves it in a trail as you run the vacuum back and forth.,2

I tried to give this a lot of time for a fair chance but I'm so disappointed in the price I paid for this. I have been trying to find a decent one for a long time and I decided this time to spend the money on a good one. It turned out to be like the cheap ones. It spits dirt out, doesn't pick up pet food or anything, really. I'm not sure why. I tried cleaning it, watching YouTube videos, etc and nothing has worked. The light is also very weak so it doesn't help but its a nice feature.",

Bonnie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Soooo disappointed!,the United States,13-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,For a $300 vacuum I would expect it to clean well. Exactly the opposite with this machine.

Deb,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work. Don't buy one!,the United States,22-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,My Crosswave doesn't suction any water up at all.

Celissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Machine for Cleaning Sealed Hardwood Floors,the United States,1-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is a great hardwood floor cleaner! After reading the directions, I filled the water tank and added the cleaner that came with the vacuum. I started using the vacuum on my large oak hardwood floor. It worked so good! We have a long haired cat and the vacuum picked up the hair and cleaned the floor at the same time. I was really amazed. When the separate dirty water tank fills up, the vacuum makes a funny noise so you know that you need to empty the dirty water and add fresh water/cleaner to the clean water tank. The vacuum cleans a pretty large area before you have to refill with fresh clean water/cleaner.The vacuum doesn't leave any real water on the floor. You can tell that it is damp, but it dries quickly to a nice sheen, not glossy. Our floor is sealed so I wasn't worried about using this machine. I would highly recommend if your floor is sealed.",5

Connie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not good as vacuum, just expensive mop",the United States,15-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Was really excited to get this for my daughter.  Works great when using the mop function.  However, it is leaving marks on the vinyl floor when used dry as a vacuum.  We've checked the roller and there is nothing wrong with it.  Suction is greatly lacking on bare floor (which is the majority of the house) and for the one area rug in the living room.  This was a Christmas gift, and the box was thrown out with the Christmas trash.  If we had not thrown the box out, would have definitely returned!  A very expensive mop at this point.",

We have cream color tile floor that shows even the lightest of traffic. We have a crawling baby and two dogs that shed a lot and go in and out the doggy door all day. By the end of each day the floor is disgusting. This machine does a great job picking up all the dog hair and the dirt. The machine is lightweight and easy to maneuver. We love that it has a strainer that separates the dog hair and the ability to rinse the brush. Highly recommend!,

Denise R,5.0 out of 5 stars,Actually works like a dream!!!!,the United States,16-Jul-18,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Oh. My. God!!!!! I got my crosswave this morning and I’m loving it. I have hardwood floors throughout my house. Sweeping then mopping took forever. I have dogs.... I just put it together which was very easy and off I went. It actually cleans and vacuums!!! Just as advertised. I have gone through several products and was never happy. It cleans and does not leave streaks. When against the baseboards it picks up everything completely. But the cleaning part doesn’t quite go all the way to baseboard. Maybe a 1/4 inch away? No biggie. I am thrilled. I used the bissell cleaning solution which worked fine. But I still have a lot of Bona. Next time I will try with that.,10

Works great especially on my area rugs.",

brazos49,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sweeps and Mops in one step,the United States,26-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"We have a lot of hard flooring in our home so I was hoping this wet/dry vacuum would work well. The most intriguing part was not having to separate the sweeping and mopping. With the Crosswave it does both at the same time. I was impressed (and grossed out) by how much dirt, pet hair and various other things were in the cup after using it. It was a little bit of effort to figure out how to dispose of the water and gunk. I ended up taking it outside to empty the water then put all the other stuff in the trash. Manually pushing the trigger to release the cleaning solution was the part that was a little tricky, but maybe it just takes some time to get used to using it. It was hard to know if the cleaning roller brush was wet enough so I ended up having to go back over parts of the floor a couple of times. What I liked about it was that it didn't release too much water at once and have a messy puddle to deal with. Before storing there is a step that self cleans the mop roller. It's lightweight and well designed and doesn't take up much room to store.",14
J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing first experience,the United States,27-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,,"I dont usually write reviews but I just had to for this product. I actually bought this on the bissell website after seeing the infomercial. I rarely buy anything from watching an infomercial at 2 in the morning from work insomnia, but it convinced me and I regretted buying it when I sobered up. It arrived and I just let it sit in the box for a week and the furballs piled up and I said why not torture this little machine.Well I have all hardwood floors that are almost 70 years old in SF and have 2 cats with 2 litter boxes that were surrounded by cat litter even with a rug beneath them (which are now relocated to the farage). This little workhorse sucked up and cleaned all the hair and litter with no problem. I mean I was shocked that it cleaned it all up so easily. It did leave streaks initially but I realized in between emptying the dirty water reservoir and adding water that it has a squeegy underneath that pick up some of the litter and caused the streaks. So I switched out the brush to the softer brush and added the hardwood cleaning solution and it left my floors streak free and in the case of my kitchen as clean as they day I installed the pergola. I am so impressed with the pet pro and hope it lasts me a while but was so worth it for this first super cleaning that it gave my floors.They only thing I recommend is that if you have very dirty floors is to use it to do an initial cleaning and clean the brush occasionally as suggested and empty out the dirty water often...then clean the pet pro up thoroughly  especially its underside and then clean again. The second time is like 1/4 the time of the first cleaning.I wish I had taken a  before and after picture but I really didn't think it would do such a good job.I even had a friend drop by while cleaning and he was amazed by my floors because he had seen them a few days before.I can see myself using this constantly and will update if it goes bad.",10
Takia,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good buy,the United States,19-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,,"I am very pleased with the Bissell Crosswave pet pro.  For this review we'll start with the cons just to get them out of the way.Cons:Price.  Depending on people's budget this item has a brand new price point of $319.  You can get it refurbished or used but it is a little steep even if it is wonderful.This is not a powerhouse vacuum like a Kirby or Eureka or if you're younger Shark or Dyson.  It will suck up small debris and most importantly pet fur but not anything like the little fluff balls that come out of dog toys.If you have upholstered furniture this will not replace the other machines you use to vacuum or clean those pieces.The arm has to be completely clicked into place or it will fall over.ProsOne pro is the weight and size.  The machine does the job of both my Shark and my Hoover Max Extract combined into one cleaning and takes up a substantially less amount of space.  It is lightweight enough that you can move it from floor to floor with ease. (the lightness of the weight contributes to the con about the arm).It does not leave things behind like sweeping does or mops do.  When I used this for the first time, I brought up such filth from floors I thought I had been maintaining that I was ashamed and wanted to throw my mop away on the spot.  You can absolutely clean with this until the water runs clear.  You can also change the rollers out every couple of months.  NO SCREWDRIVER is necessary.  This should be its own pro, but to change the roller you open the cage and pop it out in seconds no turning it upside down holding it in your lap while you try to figure out what screws fo where. Simply click and pull.The rinse tray. You should clean your brushes.  For the rest of it, you just pour water in the rinse tray and turn it on.  You can see it cleaning itself and that is definitely a pro.  The tank is small enough to manage without any problem.  My Max Extract always has a funk about it because the dirty water reservoir has a bunch of curves and corners that just can't be cleaned.  Not the same here.  You first dump out everything on the strainer then rinse the tank and the strainer and you're done.  There is a rack on the rinse tray to dry your roller brushes so they don't mildew.As a person that does a lot in the kitchen, this is an absolute gift.  Once meal prep or baking projects are complete.  Just turn it on and go.  No sweeping and wondering if you'll ever get that last bit of flour to go into the dustpan the Crosswave will take care of that for you in minutes.I tried it on tile, hardwood, and an area mat.  It did a good job on all three.  There were PAW PRINTS on the welcome mat and it took care of those with no problem.I'm sure I have more Pros but I can't think of any.  Honestly, it is so easy to use I recommend it to any busy person who has mess makers in the home.  I'm no videographer and I probably shouldn't have videotaped during the holiday cleaning and purge (as noted by my messy table) but I hope the video will help.***Update***  December 22nd, 2019.  Just saw that my Bissell's head was the same width as the stair tread on the main stairwell in my house.  The stairs are now also super clean and shiny and smell of Febreeze.  So I wanted to update this reveiw and tell you guys that the machine does a good job on stairs as well.",4
onlyoneash,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect.,the United States,5-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,,"**I have used this floor cleaner for 1.5 years now**This is literally the best hard floor cleaner I have ever used. We have tile and engineered hard wood. I don’t have pets, but I have little kids and I love that the pet version has a strainer in the dirty water bin just in case I suck up little toy parts. I also love the “pet roller” version of the brush and have already purchased several replacements for the future. I use different brands of diluted floor cleaners and they have all worked well. I do NOT vacuum my floors ahead of time. I just go right in with this machine. It gets the crumbs, noodles, little pieces of paper and wrappers, everything….So why 4 stars vs 5? The edges. It leaves about a half and inch around the baseboards unwashed and that kinda sucks. Also cleaning the vacuum after every use is a bit of a pain, but once you have a “system” down and get used to it, it’s not bad.Tips: 1) rinse and let everything dry out before reassembling.2) Empty the dirty water in the toilet, not your sink, especially if you have long haired dogs, cats.3)use diluted vinegar in it once in a while to keep any “crusty” water clogs at bay4) you will empty the dirty water tank twice for every one clean water/solution refill.",2
Jewelgoofy,5.0 out of 5 stars,best thing i could have ever bought,the United States,4-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,,"okay so first off, hi everyone. i am a mother of 4 and this mop/vacuum duo has saved my life.i have two children over 5 and two under 5 and this duo has made my life so much easier.when i first wake up everyone is sleep i go ahead and straighten up and wash all dishes.now i start picking up all trash. for example peanut butter and jelly wrappers and chip bags along with empty water bottles everywhere. if you want the best results with your duo life saver thingy majig then you might want to make sure all rubber hands, strings, wrappers, etc.ioafter i have picked up all the big items i then fill up my crosswave with the correct measurements of water and cleaner.i press the mop button and then i press the cleaner button to soak my sponge.i then clean my floors. when i hear this loud suction noise i have noticed that means the dirty water chamber is full and needs to be emptied.once emptied i notice the sound goes away and i can continue my cleaning.i would say i get to clean my kitchen and dinning room on one chamber.then the living room on another chamberbedrooms get their own chamber as wellthen lastly the bathrooms and hallways get a chamberso just in one full grand rising cleaning i have had to empty this machine 5-6 times.now thats with me including the bedrooms now if i am only cleaning the front rooms thats only 3 chambers needed.**WHEN I SAY CHAMBERS I AM REFERRING TO THE DIRTY WATER TANK THAT YOU HAVE TO EMPTY WHEN FULL OF DIRTY WATER**after i finish my full cleaning i then empty the last chamber then open the bottom mouth port and take out the dirty sponge and i either throw it in the wash or i soak in soap water for ten mins, rinse, then set out to dry.my machine is now clean and ready for the next use.another note when you hear the loud suction noise you will also see the fluids start to leak back out from the machine. dont get scared your machine is not broke its full just empty your dirty water chamber and begin cleaning again.i ordered extra wheel sponges for my machine to ensure i always have a clean one to use when time to clean.this machine is also so easy to use i make the kids do their own rooms and bathrooms and they love it.they say its as easy as the vacuum but this way they dont have to sweep vacuum and then mop they just have to pick up all the big things then use the bissel and then done.i recommend this to all**sorry no photos everytime i use it i be so excited i forget to take selfies**",2
C. Figueroa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product With Small Caveats,the United States,14-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,,"This is one of the most effective and convenient products I've ever purchased. Seriously.Overall, the CrossWave is extremely easy to use, effective at cleaning, and easy to clean up after.My home consists of mostly hardwood and vinyl floors with area rugs. I couldn't have imagined a product better suited for my needs. On hard flooring it has picked up dirt I didn't even know was there. Floors shine more now than ever. Almost any hard floor mess within reason is no match for this device.On Area rugs, the CrossWave cleans up dirt/sand, debris, and fresh wet messes easily and leaves behind a fresh scent with the Bissell cleaning solutions. Also, with two brushes included, one can be used for hard flooring and the other for area rugs to cut down on cross-contamination. The CrossWave is technically not a deep cleaner, but for low pile area rugs it seems almost as good.Clean up is easy with the CrossWave. Simply run the self-cleaning, remove the brush to dry, rinse the dirty water container & filter and let dry. Deeper cleaning is possible, but in my experience, almost never necessary.  All steps together probably take less than five minutes.There are only two major draw-backs for the CrossWave. The first is that it is no good with edges. There is about a quarter to half inch gap on either side of the brushes where no cleaning happens. This is a shame because it may lead to more steps in order to clean your floor completely. The second is that it is pretty loud. Even compared to some other vacuum products, the noise is pretty high and the pitch of the motor is higher which may contribute to the perception of noise. Other than these two issues, the CrossWave is a must-buy for homes with hard floors.",9
DDC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"works well, but be aware of some issues",the United States,22-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"I've never owned a Bissell before, and I was impressed with the vacuum overall.  It had a sturdy weight to it (i.e., didn't feel cheap), but was easily maneuverable. Assembly was very simple and it was ready to go.  It comes with two brushes for the base, and two small bottles of cleaner, which is added to the water tank.  It has settings for hard wood or rug, and has a separate button for the water/soap mixture.  The suction seemed to be excellent.  It was almost a little hard to move over carpet because it seemed to be suctioning so much.  Do not attempt to clean a small rug (like in front of a sink-- it sucks it right up!)  I was also impressed with its ability to get right to the corner of baseboards, etc.  The swivel head made changing direction very easy as well.I did have a couple of issues with it though:1.) to activate the water mix you have to hold down the button.  That wasn't a huge deal, but I honestly did not feel the water mix came out evenly at all.  I felt like it distributed too much liquid in some areas, and nothing in others.2.) clean up after is a real pain.  you have to put the vacuum in a base and put water in the base using the included cup.  Then you run the machine to clean the brush.  you then have to remove the brush and stand it up in the base.  Once you remove the tank, all the dirt and wetness melded together to create something like a wet hairball (pro tip- clean out that tank prior to running the water).  Between this and the filters, I felt like I spent more time cleaning the machine than my floors.  Also, once all that is done, you have to pick up the whole unit (and base) to store somewhere, since to clean it you need a outlet handy.I think the fact that you can vacuum and wet clean is very helpful, but this is not a tool I would use every day since the clean up is such a pain.",15
At home,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have big dogs, don't get this",the United States,21-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,,"Was very excited about this product.  I have 2 big dogs, a german shepherd and a great pyrenees.  If you are not familiar with these breeds, they are very big shedders, especially the pyrenees.  The first thing I discovered is that I had to vacuum all of my wooden floors before using this because there is so much hair.  Mind you, I vacuum every day so it is not as though this is a build up over time.  I have to vacuum first because I didn't vacuum the first time I used this and discovered that all of the fur literally clogged the machine and I had to spend a bunch of time cleaning out soggy dirty dog hair.  So vacuuming first helped but the wood floors didn't really get clean even then.  Today I thought I would thoroughly clean out the machine, all the parts, replace the roller, reassemble the darn thing and I am totally disgusted at what a miserable job this machine does.  I would encourage you to think about it before you plunk down your hard earned cash--if you need a very light duty cleaner that works on floors where small hairless pets tread, this is the one for you.  If you need something that really cleans, find something else because this machine is not worthwhile.",10
Emma,5.0 out of 5 stars,This machine changed my life (and made me realize I was living in filth),the United States,17-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,,"We have two dogs, a Lab/Weimeraner mix and a Cocker Spaniel. Neither dog is a big shedder, but we have the typical ""dog messes"" on the first floor of our home. The entire first floor of our home is all darker-colored hardwood and white marble-looking ceramic tile and area rugs, and our dogs track in all sorts of things from outside, leave muddy paw prints, and we have a fair amount of dog hair.The biggest downside of dark hardwood and white tile is that you cannot hide the fact that your floors are dirty. You can see everything, from doggy footprints to little pieces of grass and leaves, and crumbs from the humans. I've tried everything and just resorted to begrudgingly cleaning the floors every day- sweeping with a broom, sweeping with a vacuum, and then hitting the floor with Bona floor cleaner and the corresponding mop. The floors still didn't look clean and it felt like a never-ending cycle.I've had this machine for about a month and it has changed my life. I did my research and was particularly interested in the fact that it could clean both area rugs and hardwoods/tile.I'm thrilled with the performance of the Crosswave, but there are some things you should keep in mind to get the best results before you purchase:If you are cleaning a large area, you MUST stop partway through to clean the machine (dump the canister, remove any dog hair, and pull dog hair from the roller brush, hoses, etc.), even if it isn't to the ""full"" line yet. Reviews that talk about streaking or seeing clumps of dog hair on the floor are trying to power through a large area and this is what happens. It's annoying and takes time, but it's a must from a performance perspective.Move SLOWLY when cleaning your floors with this machine. It's the only way to get coverage and prevent streaking.They claim this product can vacuum and wash, and it can, but I always sweep with a broom or vacuum first to get up bigger debris (leaves, crumbs, pieces of grass) first, then use this product. Again, it's another step but it helps cut down on those issues with hair clumps or streaking. I want this machine to ""wash"" my floors primarily, so I always sweep first.Larger areas may require more of the solution or multiple batches of the solution/water mixture. For reference, our first floor is 2,000 square feet and I went through 3 full batches cleaning all of the floors, plus 1 large 10x13 area rug and 3 smaller rugs in front of the doors. Keep a close eye on the liquid levels as you go, and refill as necessary for best performance.Another crucial point: you MUST COMPLETELY CLEAN THIS MACHINE after every single use. I take all the components apart (it's very easy/intuitive to do) and wash them thoroughly and let them dry for 24 hours before putting it back together again. Pay close attention to the hoses, making sure you pull out the dog hair and any debris. Wash the brush thoroughly as well. Again, it's annoying but it's how you make sure this machine performs well.Overall, this is a great machine and I'm thrilled with the results- I can't think of a better, easier way to clean my hardwoods, tile, and area rugs with one product. This product cleans without streaks (as long as I follow the aforementioned steps), refreshes and cleans my area rugs, and makes me realize how gross my house was- it's so satisfying to dump out that dirty water and dog hair!",2
Paul M,5.0 out of 5 stars,WORK SMARTER NOT HARDER,the United States,26-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,,"I am a retired guy who lives alone with his two best friends, my dogs! I have tiled floors in my kitchen, and my dogs are permitted to play outside as they want to. I live out of the city plenty of dirt for them to get into as they romp. Of course they will track in especially on wet days. I am 69 years old and the old hands and shoulders are telling me how much I abused them over the years. Mopping of any type was getting to be almost pain wracking. Needless to say I found my self doing a less and less through cleaning of the floors. I happened to see a commercial on the pet pro cross-wave and knew this had to be better than mopping and wringing of the mop. there was just no way without mopping and going back over it to get close to clean. I got my Cross-wave and put it together but let it sit for a week before using it. The one thing I fretted was filling and emptying the fresh water solution and dirty water tanks. The first time I did it it took me about 5 minutes but after doing it a couple of times it was truly a breeze. And final clean up was just a breeze also! No wringing mops and carrying a bucket around. no slop over messes, and drying time was GREAT. Seemed when I would mop the dogs would go out once before the floor was dry, and I would get a brand new set of tracks. NOT NOW! I would buy another in a heart beat, if it holds up as well as it cleans I DEFINITELY buy a backup because I never want to be without this machine ever again, I was so impressed with this machine I decided to replace my old vacuum cleaner with a new Bissel. Like I said the goal has always been work smarter not harder and this purchase rates right up there with some of the best money spent!",3
Sheena M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"change filters, assemble properly, use correct solution to avoid problems listed",the United States,20-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,,"I’m amazed at the bad reviews I am seeing below. This machine is incredible and made me see just how dirty the floors are to the point of me becoming obsessed with cleaning them. This thing works better than anything I have tried- all the top brands. Some of the bad reviews mention water being left behind, and yes that will happen but not excessively unless you need the filter replaced. Some water is left just as a mop would leave. It’s clean water. And yes you will flood the floor if you don’t screw the lid on properly- made that mistake too. You must use the proper cleaner that is advised to use as well otherwise, it will leave more water behind and not clean as well. I have done this and believe it changes the consistency of the water. All of the bad reviews listed are from user errors and not at all from the machine. After a few months mine started not doing well but it needed new filters. Also if the filter gets wet it won’t suck as well but that only happens if you are not using the proper solution that goes in the machine. Every-time I use this I become the mom getting on to everyone for how disgusting WE are as a FAMILY bc it truly sucks so much disgusting dirt and something I have no clue where it came from at times. (I have engineered hard wood and tile). It sucks out the stuff from every crevice On the floor. I encourage all of the bad review people to replace filters and use proper solution and try again. Also if you do not have the bucket, cover or bottle put in properly it won’t work and I believe more emphasis should be explained in the pamphlet so customers do not give up so easy. It sucks so well that I replace filters often- at least monthly if I want that super suction. The filters don’t always look dirty but they are in the creases. I wash my brushes in the washing machine after I use them if they are too dirty or I simply air dry them by removing the lid and taking it out. The only think I hate is emptying the bucket but again that’s bc of me and my dirty family plus two dogs LOL.",2
M. Courtois,2.0 out of 5 stars,Clogs easy have to clean out every few minutes very time consuming,the United States,4-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,,Okay despite reading both good and not so good reviews being an owner of 2 dogs and one cat I thought I would give this machine a try. First of all the price tag... let’s just say this thing should be priced at around 89.99 at the most maybe then I wouldn’t be so very disappointed. I mean come on for 300 bucks this thing should be nothing short of amazing! It’s a great concept how ever unless your floors are already clean within minutes it gets so clogged that it will no longer suck the water back up.... so you have to stop take it apart and clean it and put it all back together again then within minutes it is clogged back up again... I am not sure about you but as it is advertised as a pet product it should be able to handle some pet hair without clogging every few minutes... I don’t know what else to say. You will probably think that I must be an exception to the rules since so many other people have a glowing review ( which by the way is what I thought or hoped prior to buying this thing) however my floors are not abnormally filthy we do sweep and swifter on a regular basis and for what it is advertised as it should be much better. Not really happy with it.... not for the price I feel like I for the most part like what it does in those few minutes before it clogs...,6
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just SUCK it up! Vacuum regularly and mop your floors, don’t waste your money on this!",the United States,6-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,"We purchased this vacuum mop a few months ago. At first, it seemed like it was working well on our laminate floors. One thing I always do before using this is dry vacuum with our Shark. The more crud and crap you have on your floors, the more you will have to empty this vacuum mop. Plus, it’s disgusting (I see how many people just sucked up food, hair, and whatever other nasty things were on their floors). Sorry, but I just prefer to get what I can up with a regular vacuum first. Unfortunately, this started leaking all over the floors when I would finish with it. I always empty the water out and clean everything but still ended up placing a towel underneath because water just leaks out. I don’t think the suction is that great either, but again, I don’t leave large chunks of things on my floors before using this and I’m not taking a magnifying glass to my floors after. I can’t speak for how it works on an area rug. Overall, I’m not satisfied with this vacuum mop. It was fine at first, but I feel that it’s slowly breaking and no longer doing it’s job. It will probably be going in the trash which is sad because these are almost $300. Save your money, get something else, or just vacuum and mop your floors separately. I understand the concept behind it because it’s supposed to make cleaning easier, but some things are better done the old fashioned, un-lazy way. And we are getting VERY lazy, depending on too many products that are overpriced, and (no surprise!) aren’t holding up to their value and what they say they are supposed to do.",One
D. Del Valle,2.0 out of 5 stars,Really disappointed,the United States,11-May-20,CrossWave Only,,"Let me start by saying that when I first purchased this thing, I was in love. It cleaned so well and was easy to use. After about 6 months, it started just pushing dirty water all over my floors. I took care of this thing like it was my child. I followed the manufacturer's instructions regarding cleaning and drying. I did exactly what I was supposed to do and still, by month 7 it was worse than useless-- it was dirtying my floors. Knowing it was under warranty, I called Bissell and after about 45 minutes on the phone trying to trouble shoot the issue, they finally told me to go to a vacuum repair person not too close to my home. I took it, he agreed it was broken. Then told me he couldn't fix it. So back I go to calling Bissell. After more holding and more explaining, they indicated they would send me a replacement BUT THERE WAS A CATCH-- I had to cut the wire of my unit and send it to them. After they received it, they would process the replacement. This is fine except that it took over a week to get to them. I'm sure it'll take over a week to get me my new crosswave. All the while, I'm left with just an broom since I got rid of my vacuum and mop when I bought the crosswave. All of this is very infuriating for a piece of equipment that is NOT cheap and made by a well know manufacturer.",2
Matt Mondon,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY. Does not work for very long before losing suction! Waste of money!,the United States,13-May-21,CrossWave Only,,"I had the first Bissel crosswave model and loved it in the begining. I used it for a couple years and noticed it gradually started leaving more and more dirty water on the floor and to remedy this I would have to go over the same area several times, effectively doubling and tripling the time and effort to clean the floor. Eventually the lack of suction was so bad it became unusable. I threw it out and got the new model expecting it to be better and to last longer. Instantly I noticed it didn't suction very well right out of the box and it was doing the same thing the old model was doing, losing suction and leaving dirty water on the floor. After a few uses it got even worse and is now worthless and not worth the effort of using. I even do my sweeping BEFORE I use this on the floor to lessen the load but it makes no difference, it wont suction the water all the way up into the tank. Thats 250 bucks down the drain! Do not buy this! If it does work well out of the box it wont be for very long and when it suddenly starts leaving dirty water all over the floor you will be very frustrated at the amount of time and effort you have to put into it. Eventually it wont work at all. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",One

I read the negative reviews on this and though to myself, are you cleaning a barn?  This is not a shop vac.  It is not designed to vacuum up rocks, hay, cat litter, etc.  I cleaned my entire house with half a tank of cleaner and it worked fantastic.  I have 2 boys that track all sorts of fun stuff in the house, sticks, grass, mud, sand, rocks, toys, and such.  I did a quick sweep of the big stuff, and ran this and it worked very well.  the push mops just push the debris into the corners, this sucks it up.  it will get you about 1"" from the wall.  This is a huge time saver for me as I normally have to sweep thoroughly, then mop the crap out of the floors, pushing the debris around.  this is so simple, effective, and affordable.  This will save me a lot of time.  Cleaning is easy, I just dump the waste in the toilet and flush it.  I have no carpet in my house and this is the best 300 bucks I've spent.",2
spanky34,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted a Pet Pro, Got a Pet Amateur.  Regretfully Returning",the United States,22-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,,"I'm a 30 year old bachelor that asked for a vacuum for Christmas.  When I opened it up this morning, I was pumped to have received what was at the top of my wish list.  I rushed home and put it together.  It went together so easily.  I thought I finally found the vacuum I had been searching for!  I only spilled a tiny drop of the cleaning formula as I mixed the bottle with their pet formula and my tap water.  I plugged it in and moved the chairs away from the table, eager to vacuum underneath the it.  I pressed the button and it whirred to life.  Immediately sucking up hair from anywhere within 2 inches of the head.  I couldn't believe it.  Well, it was too good to be true,  because the good stops there.After about 3 minutes in my small dining room, I noticed it was starting to lose suction.  I saw a piece of dog food and said, well... It is the Pet PRO.. It couldn't even pick up a lone kibble.  I kept pressing on wards and after about 5 minutes, I decide to tackle the hall.  Already, it couldn't pick up hair that wasn't directly underneath the head.  My Great Pyraniese/Golden Lab mix's long and wiry hair was too much for it.  I had to stop and clean the vacuum.  When I pulled off the plastic guard to do that, I noticed it was cracked and broken.  I couldn't believe it.. Less than 30 minutes in my house with a $300 vacuum and it was already cracked at the head.  I went ahead and cleaned the inlet and put the cracked head back on, determined to finish my living room.When I was done with the living room, I started taking it apart to clean it.  That's when I realized what a real chore it is to clean this thing.  It completely negates any time savings.  You have to clean the debris canister, the canister filter, the microfiber head, and in my case, I had to lift the whole damn vacuum into the sink because the inlet was caked with dog hair and debris.  Cleaning this thing was pretty disgusting and I had to clean it twice in less than 500 sq ft of hardwood floors.In the end.. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could because my floors are pretty dang clean right now.. Going with 2, because it couldn't even pick up a kibble of food.  I bet it'd work great at just mopping my floors if I had already vacuumed, but that's not why I spent $300 on a 2 in 1.  I bet it works great with a short haired dog or two.  I bet I just had bad luck with the plastic head cracking.  Maybe I thought too highly of the Pet Pro's marketing, but I'd advise caution in purchasing.  If you've got a large dog, with long hair, that sheds a lot, this vacuum is not up to that task and I truly question the long term durability of the product.",4
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smelly,the United States,31-May-20,CrossWave Only,,"It smells. Not only is the liquid gross and mixed with debris on the floors.... it smells. Even if you empty it every time and wash it out. The filter got super gross after just 2 uses and when you turn it on and the motor starts running there is the awful left over smell of pet urine. It’s easy enough for my kids to use it but they won’t because the overwhelming smell when turned on. I have returned to my handheld mop and buckets. The mops also gets dirt off the floor better than this thing. There are two settings- hardwood floor and area rug. I always turn it to area rug because the hardwood floor setting doesn’t get it wet enough to clean. You can also hold down a button to squirt extra water as you pass so I continually am having to hold this button down to get enough water to clean. It hurts your arm and you’re having to make pass after pass to get dirt up. I have a dog and two kids so I need something that works quick. Not something smelly, makes my arm hurts, and I have to pass over and over the same spot. Not efficient when cleaning a whole kitchen. If you’re the type that cleans everyday then this would work for you as it won’t get super dirty. But if you’re a single mom like me- you don’t have time for this.",3
H. Reid,4.0 out of 5 stars,Grabs a lot of dirt that regular vacuuming and sweeping misses.,the United States,16-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"I've never had a power mop/vacuum like this so it's a new experience for me. Overall, it works well. It was very easy to assemble and operate. The only thing I struggled with a bit was spraying the cleaning solution. I found that it was a little bit difficult to keep the rotating brush wet while not spraying too much. The spray function is manual, so you have to pull the trigger to make the brush wet. The problem is that sometimes the brush seemed too dry and other times there was too much cleaning solution, which created dirty puddles. Finding the right balance is a trial and error experience. Eventually I got the hang of it. This vacuum worked well on both my hardwood and tile, but the brush is too soft to really clean grout well. We have troublesome, very light-colored grout that is a nightmare to keep clean. This vacuum helped a bit, but I wish there was another brush that came with firm, hard bristles to really get the grout. Nice product. It did grab a lot of dirt. I'm happy. Emptying dirty water in the reservoir is a snap and that really shows how well this vacuum works.",7

DSloan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dead withing ninety days,the United States,7-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,,"I am so upset right now. I bought this product and I LOVED IT.  Less than ninety days after writing a rave review it dies. Going through customer service has been ridiculous. I don't have a service center within 300 miles. They want me to pack it up and send it in, in the middle of a pandemic with three kids with underlying conditions which means loading them all up and going into town and mailing it off. Oh and refused to let me speak with a manager. This is after being transferred into oblivion and dropped off calls for a couple hours. Now they are forcing me to take a picture of cutting the cord with pictures of the entire machine to 'prove' I can't use it, I guess? Not even pictures of the problems. If this had been the second or even third return I would be understanding of the theatrics. But after all this, to be treated like I am lying when all I want is to have a replacement product so I can get back to cleaning?! It is not worth spending your money since they won't back up their products without insane measures. Even Amazon has better customer service than this. So frustrating. So absolutely disappointed. I waited months to buy this product. Now I am in tears and have to go buy a mop and bucket while I wait for them to study the pictures and decide if I cut the cord close enough to the machine. Don't waste your time and money.",One
J. Peplinski,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for lightly dirty floors, takes more time to clean the various parts",the United States,5-May-18,CrossWave Only,,"The Pet Pro version of the Bissell Crosswave is designed to take on the chores of vacuuming and cleaning floors - both hard surface and carpet - all with less effort. It is true that I'm spending less effort overall than if I were vacuuming, then mopping my floors. I'm not sure I'm spending less time overall, though. Some floor areas that get heavy use end up taking a lot of passes in order to clean. Also, I end up spending a lot of time after using the device to clean up and dry all the parts. Because of the amount of pet hair we end up getting (3 dogs/3 cats), I still end up pulling out my vacuum to get most of the dust bunnies before running the crosswave. If you have a more reasonable number of pets, you will probably do just fine with the Crosswave handling both tasks. And my experience is in an all ceramic tile home, so I can't speak well for how it handles carpet.Here's my experience with best practices on all tile floors. First, if you are NOT like me and clean your floors regularly, then this should be able to handle keeping your floors spotless. But if you are lazy like me, or maybe you just have a very high traffic area with lots of mud, then expect this to work, but after multiple passes. I will start by quickly sweeping the floors and picking up whatever loose debris I can. Then I start going over the floors with the Crosswave. What I've found works best is to have a bucket with cleaning solution and some sort of scrub brush and use that to loosen any caked on dirt. Then you can go over it with the Crosswave and have it suck up the extra water instead of wringing out a mop....SO MUCH EASIER. The scrub brush on the Crosswave just is not strong enough for the super heavy stuff. Also, I wouldn't expect the Crosswave to turn dirty grout into sparkling clean, like new grout. I could probably avoid the extra bucket and scrub brush if I just cleaned my floors more often, but that's probably not going to happen.PROs:-MUCH less effort in scrubbing floors, especially if you use it regularly-Don't need to vacuum floors, then wash/mop/wring out dirty waterCONs:-Takes many passes with the scrubber to get the really dirty parts-Lots of plastic parts to clean up and then let dry before you put it all away-Expensive official cleaning solution (though others have some DIY homemade options, I've read)Who this is for: This would be good for anyone who doesn't let their floors get too dirty between cleanings, and doesn't want to both vacuum and wash. It would also be good for someone who has a physical condition that makes it hard to scrub a floor with a mop and then wring it out.",5
Ceej,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest review, with the pros and cons",the United States,13-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,,"Let me first say that if you intend to buy this product, it is not a lazy person product. If what you want is something to quickly clean up messes and set aside, you will no doubt be disappointed by this product. I have had it for 3 months, and I use it almost daily. I made the mistake of not cleaning it each time I used it, the first week I had it and now every time I use it no matter how well I clean it, it smells. The reason for this is the plastic parts are porous so if you don't clean them right away, they will retain the odors of whatever it is you are cleaning up. I have tried everything, bleach, baking soda, cleaning solution, you name it to get those smells out, nothing works. On the bright side, if you take care of your machine and clean it immediately after each use, I have no doubt this will be the best appliance you ever own. I have 4 dogs and two cats, and this cleans up as well as it advertises. Kitty litter, pee, vomit, and hair are easy to clean up with this. I have even used this in my kitchen to pick up a bottle of dressing that I dropped. I have saved myself many rugs with this as it cleans animal mess from that too, as long as you clean it up that day. I had read a review that it leaves streaks of dirty water everywhere. That has also happened to me, and it turned out that the little hose that seals the opening into the dirty bucket was not properly in place or you didn't snap the dirty bucket securely in place. Once I figured that out, I never had that problem again. If you clean your brushes regularly as I have been they will last you quite a while. What you will probably be paying for most are new filters. The odors aren't so bad when they are brand new. Would I have paid $300 dollars for this, knowing all of these facts? Probably, but I would have taken better care of my machine from day one. Even so, everytime I fire it up and all I smell is dog pee and vomit, I have my second thoughts.",4
Andre Lafrance,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is not an all in one vacuum mop as they claim.,the United States,18-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,,"To clarify, I did not purchase this product on Amazon but I felt like I needed to leave a review somewhere.The crosswave is great at cleaning floors, however it is hands down one of the worst vacuums on the market. Don't make the mistake of thinking this will also replace your dry vacuum, it won't.The poor design of the dirty Water/debris canister relies heavily on the water to catch debris and pet hair on your floor. If you decide to just vacuum and not use the water as well, your filter will be completely ruined in under 5 minutes. There is absolutely nothing preventing hair and debris from getting directly sucked into that dinky 10$ filter. Even when used in wet mode, the filter still gets dirty alarming quickly.Cleaning the unit is also a hassle, do not expect to simply dump out the canister like they show in the commercials. You really have to spend 5-10 min after you're done cleaning your floor to then clean the entire vacuum after every use, it's simply not a fun job. Most times it's not even worth using this on big messes because you will end up spending more time cleaning the unit than you would have cleaning the mess with a paper towel or rag.At this price, I would rather shell out an extra 100$ on a cordless Hizero that is much easier to use, easier to clean and is actually aesthetically pleasing to look at, the crosswave looks like a toy.It's also not very manouverable and can't reach under tables without lifting off the ground.There's no wand for spot cleaning, not that it would do much because this things suction power is absolutely terrible.In conclusion, it cleans floors extremely well but you'll be going through atleast one filter a month and spending a lot of time cleaning the machine.I have since returned my unit, I couldn't stand the all the hassles that came with it.",One
D. Mcleod,5.0 out of 5 stars,It like magic and so effortless! I love it!,the United States,30-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,"To all pet lovers who love clean floors,  this is the most wonderful floor cleaner you will ever ever ever own. My brother bought this for me for my birthday and I love it; every time I use it!! I have owned two Hoover Floor-mates and they’re nothing compared to this. Light weight, tough and sturdy,  maneuvers well in tight and low places, easy on your back, and cleans floors like magic. It sucks up pet hair and dirt with little effort, cleans tough stuck on things like nobody’s business. Although it’s not required, I do spay a little of the cleaning solution on suck-on areas of grime to give it a few minutes to soften before running the mop head over the area and it sucks it right up. It also is wonderful for simple cleaning jobs like wicking up spills easily too. It is just a time saver!It comes with its own tray that you store it in. The tray also makes cleaning the mop roller effortless too. Simply  pour cleaning solution into the storage cleaning tray, turn it own and let it run till it runs clear and your done. To clean the dirty water reservoir, simply rinse it out with a water hose, a hand held shower head or simply put water in it, use a narrow long handled bush (like a toilet brush used for only the machines cleaning purpose), swish the water around,  pour it out and your done. This is a wonderful tool to own. I can’t say enough good things about it.The only thing I found that I didn’t like is that it can easily suck the power cord up Into the mop roller (and it doesn’t hurt the cleaning unit, just a little aggravating), but after I got use to holding the power-cord in my right hand as I cleaned and mopped the floor, it was all a breeze from then on.Please know I’m not affiliated with this company in anyway; except I own one of their floor cleaners, I’m am so impressed I simply had to share it with anyone who is looking for a simple easy efficient wonderful way to keep floors clean with kids and pets in their home. If you would like something to make your life so much easier when it comes to cleaning your floors, this is it. Now if I could find something to fold clothes and put them away, I’d be set!",
WB5MGR,2.0 out of 5 stars,A purchase filled with regret...,the United States,18-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,,"I bought the Crosswave Pet Pro from that orange big box store...because it was on sale and I needed to replace a competitive product which I had worn out and the other company was not making the same design any longer. The price of the crosswave was more than double of my older product, but cost was not my primary concern. I wanted a machine to mop my 2000sqft of porcelain tile floors that could perform light dry vacuuming, wet mopping and water removal. I was willing to give this unit a shot... Boy am I so sorry! This thing is in a word a dumpsterfire. It’s no more effective at cleaning hard floors than a swiffer wetjet. My unit is unable to pick up even small debris like a small dead bug, or a dropped peanut or piece of cereal. Best it can do is grit,dust and hair. Worst things about it is that the design forces the debris to be continuously ground against your floor as the roller spins as it doesn’t want to come off the roller and into the catch container. Also, even with the water supply container out of my machine it won’t pick up water well off the floor. So I end up just using it to wet and scrub the floor and then mopping it dry with a swiffer. (Porcelain with sealed grout won’t soak up water you leave standing on it, so you have to remove it or it will stay there till it evaporates...) This machine has no real redeeming value as a dry vacuum or as a wet floor cleaner in my opinion.",One
Tracy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where has this been all my life!?!?!,the United States,23-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,,"I researched this product for over a year before buying because some of the reviews left me hesitant. I wish I just went for it sooner because it has been life changing and my floors have never been this clean! Between 3 kids, a constantly muddy dog and a hubby that never takes his work boots off when he comes in the house, I could not keep up. A few notes to counter other's complaints:1. It is NOT had to clean all the pieces when you are done. It takes me 3 minutes, tops, to rinse all the pieces and wipe down the machine. Its not complicated or time consuming at all. I rinse them, then throw them in a little basket on the shelf in my closet so the can dry out. Easy peasy. No more work than cleaning out my mop bucket.2. It doesn't get close to the edges. But I use a spray mop for upkeep in between using this and get close to the edges with that on those day and have to clean my baseboards often anyway so get a little deeper cleaning of the edges at that time. Its been a non issue and the gains are worth this one flaw. I personally would not upgrade to the cordless to get the close edging. Having the extra time available with the cord is the bigger win.3. Don't use the cleaner that comes with it. I know the manufacturer says you have to, but I don't. I use a very mild alternative. It's their cleaner that causes streaks, not the machine.BUY IT!!!

I WANTED to love this crosswave. I would look at all the positive reviews and wonder what I was doing wrong to hate this product so much, but I can’t take it anymore. I am so disappointed I spent so much money on something I HATE so much. Here are my issues: 1) It SMELLS-Like musty, moldy water. I thoroughly clean every single piece of this product after each and every use and it still reeks. I use the self cleaning mode as well. Still smells.  2) Suction seems okay but lately, it’s leaving the floors VERY wet. 3) It leaves dirty puddles and drops of gray water at random times during use. You’ll have to go over and over and over the same area to suck everything up. The combo vacuum / mop feature is supposed to be a time saver- but because of this product’s shortcomings it ends up taking more time to clean the area. Normally I really like Bissell products-and I’m still blown away with how many positive reviews this product has. To me it’s just a bad product not worth the money.",One
D. Deckert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Changed my life!!,the United States,12-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,,"I  bought my bissel crosswave pet pro at Walmart a few months ago as they had it on sale for $239.00 at the time. I really struggled over whether to take a chance spending that much and I am so glad I did. This thing works great! I use it daily. I have a basset hound, a goldendoodle, and 3 cats. Not to mention I have several people in and out of my house every day. My floors are usually a mess. Was so hard to keep up on them due to the traffic. Not anymore. I can get them all done in under 20 minutes . Now that I can vacuum and mop at same time.I really only had one small concern in the beginning. Having all those animals, the unit has to deal with a lot of animal hair. It does a great job of it. However , when I would go to empty the tank, I would have to find somewhere to dump water with tons of crap including hair in it. I really didn't want it going into my septic. While weather was nice, I would take it outside, but that wasn't really practicle. Soooo, I ordered the pictured large tea strainer. I set it in my sink and dump the mess in it. It filters out all the bad stuff then I can just toss it in garbage. It is also large enough I rinse and clean all the pieces over it too.  Got it here on amazon for $9. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGWS7JS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The unit does come with the small strainer that fits in the waste tank to strain it out, but yeah, it can't handle the job at my house. lolThe unit also comes with a small bottle of bissell cleaner. I used, and it is fine, but I don't buy it to do my floors. I use my own preferred cleaner. Perfectly fine to do that. Just remember though, if you put your own cleaner in DO NOT go by the markings on the bottle for measurements. If you do it will be too strong and leave your floor sticky. I fill my jug with water and literally use about 2 caps full of spic and span. Works great! Saves money.I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to cut their floor cleaning time in half . You won't be sorry.",One
AnAmazonCustomer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Put it to the test and it does well,the United States,16-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"Heavy duty - no, not really. Good for daily maintenance - absolutely. What I like most about this little machine is the all in one feature. Press a button and the trigger - you can spray a light mist plus suck up pet hair all in one quick action. Perfect for tile floors. I was expecting this machine so literally didn't sweep or mop for days. I have dogs and cats plus live in Florida - land of perpetual sand and sunshine. Add in a few light spills in the kitchen floor and you get a pretty good picture of the dismal state of affairs. This arrived and it took about 10 minutes to unbox and put the handle, roller etc together. Use is pretty self explanatory. Initially I tried the vacuum only - not bad. About average. It sucks up a couple random oak leaves, cat hair and some dirt tracked in on our athletic shoes. Next I tried the mist/mop function on the area just vacuumed - again, not bad. This won't do a deep cleaning but it provides a quick pick up for small spots. Finally I just hit the mist and vac all in one to see how it would handle both at the same time...frankly this is how I'll be using it 99% of the time...did fine. Again, it won't fix deep set stains nor will it replace a shop vac but if you need a quick way to pick up paw prints across the floor while grabbing the cat hair along the way - this is the machine.",6
Caroline D. Roberts,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Timesaver if you have shedding dogs, complete review",the United States,13-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,,"I waited several months to write this review so I could make sure I had the entire picture. I am hoping it is helpful to you as I had so much trouble making a decision after reading the varied reviews for such an expensive product.Let me start by saying I love this floor cleaner overall. It has been a game changer in my life. I have two German shepherds which  shed like crazy and a cat.  Before this we would go through and sweep up all the hair, and then mop the floors. Then we found we had to sweep twice or somehow we would always end up with wet clumps of hair we had missed tangled in the mop. If we did not empty the mop bucket frequently, I felt like we were scrubbing our floors with dirty water. I hated it and would put it off.Enter the Bissell pet pro cross wave.  It vacuums up the hair as it mops with clean water and soap. When I was considering it a store associate told me she could not justify the price when she already had a vacuum, a broom, and a mop and she was not going to put out this kind of money. Well for the one time expense I save so much time and it’s so much easier, I don’t regret the investment one bit!  I can power through it in an hour with a lightweight machine instead of two lugging a heavy bucket and I am not smearing dirty hair with a mop on the floor!It does have a learning curve. My first few attempts left streaky floors. I learned a few that things:  as wonderful as it is to vacuum and mop together the less hair you have to deal with the better.  I will vacuum, sweep or pick up noticeable tufts of hair before I start. Cleaning the hair/dirty water filter is truly disgusting and the less wet hair the better.  That being said it’s wonderful that all the hair that is there just gets sucked up out of the way.Pass over the area with the soap on, and then again once or twice without the soap to suck it all back up. This is what keeps from leaving the floor very wet so it does not get streaks.I use this mostly for the tile in our house and it all looks great. We have one room with laminate, I also use it in there and it cleans the floor and gets the hair but it does not look shiny when done. It’s a lifesaver for all our tile.Cleaning it after each use is really gross as I mentioned. But it’s super easy just follow manufacturer’s directions and you will have it ready to go for next time for sparkling clean floors!",3
Michelle M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Machine/Worth Every $$!!!,the United States,7-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,,"I have purchased many other brands, claiming to be and or do everything the Crosswave Machines Can!!!  I DONT THINK SO!!!!!  , I purchased  the Bissell Crosswave Pet Machine about a year ago, when decided to purchase a Rottie!!!  So Pet Parents our there,  this is a must have machine!  It will save you hours of hard work!!  Needless to say, this machine is ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY the best floor cleaner you can buy!!  The intake Tank (Dirty Water)  includes a removable trap, whenEmptying this you were able to see all of the dog hair and other items that were collected prior to emptying the dirty water , which alone satisfied me greatly, with my OCD, i am very particular and hard to please for sure!!! I Am 100% certain, this machine works and guarantee your floors will be sparkling clean it’s amazing and it’s a must have!!  I have used only cleaners made for this machine, both the multi surface cleaner and the exclusive wood Floor Cleaner, and they DO make a difference slightly I believe!  I am almost certain that when using the Wood Cleaner vs the Multi Floor Cleaner my floors appear to be Shinier!  With the Multi Floor Cleaner they are still shiny, just think it looks a little duller, then when I use the Soecific Wood Floor Clean!!  For anyone on the fence, Think No More. It’s worth every dollar, AND IS A DEFINITE INVESTMENT!!",One
SKB1323,5.0 out of 5 stars,MADE FOR DOGS AND FARMGIRLS,the United States,28-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,,"his is possibly the answer to my dreams. Okay, I have never dreamed about a vacuum cleaner, but I have possibly fantasized about being that person with the always clean floors. I live on a farm and have several dogs and we all, at one time or another, parade through the house with muddy feet. I sweep up mounds of dog hair and dirt and grass and other stuff. I got this yesterday and tried it last night in my kitchen. I thought I'd give it the ultimate test. I didn't sweep or vacuum before I used it (and my vacuum is a shop vac). I thought it would probably lock up with dog hair and grass wrapped around the brush. IT WORKED!!! I literally scraped half a cup of mud out of the canister when I cleaned it up (and enough dog hair to clog my sink drain). I'd read some reviews saying it was hard to clean, but I thought it was super easy. I took everything apart and rinsed it in the sink immediately. Then, I set the whole vacuum cleaner in the sink and used the sprayer to backflush clean water down the hole. DON'T SUBMERGE IT!! Just run some water through that little hole where the dirty water runs between the brush and the dirty water canister. Worked like a charm! I used it today to clean the hardwood floor in my living room (I did a quick sweep first). I love this thing! My only ""complaint"" is that it doesn't get all the way to the wall. I haven't found a vacuum cleaner yet that does so that isn't a surprise. My ""complaint"" is that the rest of the floor looks so good that the little ring around the outside looks obnoxious now! LOL",4
Project XYZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very clean floor but time consuming when wrapping up.,the United States,7-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,,"I picked this one up from Walmart when I return back to California on a fishing trip. I dont have pet. It was intent to clean the floors after my 2 naughty kids. It picked up all the hairs especially the wife and smallest sand and particle. The hair will tangle and wrap around the brush. I find it best to pick up all the big item first, dry vacuum, and then wash. Prior to each process, I empty the tray, clean the filters, and brush. Result was great. No more smelly carpet or floor. For tangle, I use a scissor or small knive to dig and cut. For those who complaint about the suction or not sucking water, check the inlet. I find it easier to have extra brush and filters for quick swap and go. Clean everything when finished. Not recommend for day to day use but for weekly or monthly deep cleaning. Love how clean the floor is.",One
Teedubs13,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dirtiest cleaning tool I’ve ever had the displeasure of using,the United States,1-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,,"As a cat mom, the bane of my existence is keeping the bathroom where the litter box is clean. I was hopeful that this expensive machine would make cleaning the stray kitty litter (and resulting dust) away - as well as keep keep my laminate wood floors cans area rug clean.First, this doesn’t save time. The only way I was able to use this effectively was to go over once as a vacuum and then go over a second time as a mop. Otherwise this horrible machine would miss more than it typically did.Second, as other have pointed out, emptying the bin is disgusting. Think like trying to get gummy soaking wet litter that’s mixed with hair and heaven knows what else out of tiny “drain” holes in the strainer. Gross.After a few months of use, this disgusting machine began spewing rotten litter scents into every room I cleaned with it - and this was after I suffered through cleaning the machine after EVERY use.Finally, on low-ish quality laminate in my rental unit this ineffective machine left horrible streaks on the floor and sometimes appeared dirtier. And the room also usually smelled of stale, damp kitty litter.Moral of the story the $300 machine I purchased a few months ago is now waiting to be taken out to the dumpster.Bottom line: Ineffective, Smelly, Gross. Do not recommend. I switched to a Roomba and $25 swifter which is both easier to maneuver and way more cost effective.",2
Dawn B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,GAME CHANGER!,the United States,20-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,,"This thing is a GAME CHANGER. As a busy momma of 3, with three dogs (short hair; 2 chihuahua pugs & a slobbery American bully who loves to play in the garden) this thing changed my floor cleaning routine. I’ll never be without one of these again. I got mine from Costco, so I could avoid the hassle and frustration if it does break down (hasn’t yet, works great!).So, I used to sweep or vacuum and then use the swiffer mop. I’d then go back and clean any spots that needed it by hand. So, it was a process because our whole main living area is LVP (vinyl plank that looks like wood).Now I go through with us and vacuum. Takes me under five minutes. I can see all the dried junk it picks up- hair, leaves, dirt etc. then I go through and run it on wet where it scrub the floors and removes all the stuck on dirt and messes. It’s great to grab and clean up baby spit up with or dog slobber or when a big kid spills a drink. I rarely use my vacuum cleaner anymore.My biggest complaint is cleaning it to put it away. It actually takes over a day for all the filter piece to dry to put it away and then I’m ready to reuse it again. Because of my rush to put it away now every time I turn it on it smells musty because of the filter. I’m going to order extra filters so they can thoroughly dry between uses and it’s not out of commission while it dries for days at a time.Other than that I love this thing and won’t be without one again.",
Tom Steele,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for every job, but great for rugs AND hard surfaces!",the United States,22-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"I love Bissell products and own several, even one of their BIG room cleaning shampoo rug vacuums that does a really good job. This is exceptionally well made. It is classy all the way, with spare rollers and two (small) bottles of shampoo and the whole package is the Cadillac experience.And it works very well. As with all Bissell products, this is very good at cleaning up stains on rugs and cleaning floors, it is very good on hardwoods which a lot of shampooers are not. This is really good at pretty much whatever you throw at it. But I don't see it taking the place of all my other vacuums and shampooers.For instance, it isn't really able to handle big jobs like my big Bissell shampoo machine, although this will do well on medium sized jobs like when the dog has an accident or throws up in the middle of the night and you throw a towel over it until you can get to it in the morning. But I wouldn't set out to do the living room floor with this vs my big Bissell machine.And for regular vacuuming, I'm more likely to pull out my Dyson than to use this one.For hardwoods and tile, it is VERY good! That is one of its strong points.For me, I think for small/medium carpet cleanup and hardwoods and tile this is the bomb. Very well made, attractive, all the bells and whistles and reasonably priced. It's a win for me! Thanks Bissell.",5
Aubrey d.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Oh how I love this machine,the United States,2-Jul-20,CrossWave Only,,"for years I used the old broom and mop, but once my daughter started crawling I needed something better. Let me start with the pros. The best part about this machine is that it vacuums and mops at once, which saves you time. No hassle worrying about multiple tools to do the job, and bissels pet solution is great, it smells amazing! I have luxury vinyl plank flooring, so in the past ive struggled with different solutions leaving residue behind. I use this machine weekly all through my house, and almost daily after baby meal times.Now the cons...The power chord is not as long as I would like it to be. The dirty water tank also fills up pretty fast. I usually have to empty it twice before im done. The brush roll is not machine washable. While I love this on hardwood, washing low pile rugs is a challenge when the rugs aren't heavy enough to stay in place while you push the machine.Overall, I love my purchase and am so glad I got this for my growing baby who's quickly becoming quite the mess maker.",One
JMFlagirl,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Dirty water streaks, good, but def not worth price",the United States,15-May-21,CrossWave Only,,"I was sooooooo excited for this. I purchased from a store directly. Must say the first maybe 2 times I used it, it was not bad. By like the 3rd or 4th, I was having some issues with streaks. The water comes out ok, and the suction seems to work ok, but it leaves streaky dirty water marks. So I ordered new Bissell roller brushes. Cleaned every part out and replaced the filter (mind you, this was after only the 4th or 5th use, but I have dogs, so I thought that could be why). The streaks are still there. I've cleaned the wheels, everything. No clue what else to do. I still use it bc I spent SO MUCH and even got a few different cleaning liquids. But I have to finish everything off with a Swiffer wet wipe just to get rid of the streaks. Then I have to spend at least 20-30 min cleaning all the parts which honestly wouldn't bug me so much if it wasn't for the streaks.  Its also a bit frustrating that when it's in standing mode, it still slides and falls all the time. I have to prop it up against a wall when not using.  I think if I didn't have 2 bigger dogs bringing lots of dirt in, or tile floors that create little bumps when going over, I might actually be ok with it. But given my situation, it's too much money and work for subpar clean up.",
Maggi,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this machine for what it is for.,the United States,18-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,,"I live with a disabled relative who can do nothing for themselves. Even getting into the wheelchair is a big deal. When they say they have to poop they mean now and the other day I didn't move fast enough. By the time we got them in the chair they had pooped all over the floor. After getting them situated from shower to bed I then had to go tackle the floor mess. There is nothing more disgusting than this. Got the big stuff up and then got out ""Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro All in One Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop"". OMG! It did such a phenomenal job cleaning the floor. I was certain I was going to have to throw the unit away after all this but followed the directions on cleaning it until there was no smell. Cleaned up beautifully. One of my ludite family members finally conceded that the Crosswave was a well worth it machine. My machine is corded. Kinda wish it was cordless but then worried it might not be powerful enough. My complaints are that it doesn't get up close along the wall. I use Fabuloso as my cleaner. Smells better than most others",
Starry Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has met our expectations almost completely,the United States,17-May-21,CrossWave Only,,"We have had other floor cleaners before and were often disappointed by how heavy, complex and poor job the machines did when cleaning. We love the Crosswave because it gets the job done quickly and easily and it is no longer a chore to mop. With a small dog it is a constant project just keeping up with pee on our hardwood floors. We followed the instructions and used the Bissell branded multi floor cleaner. You just push the trigger to release as much soapy fluid as you like when going over the mess, then release to stop releasing fluid and to go over back and forth to mop and dry. The area dries very quickly (no more than 10 minutes) and it smells fresh and feels clean. Cleanup is so easy unlike our previous machines which took a mechanic to take apart. I was amazed by how little water this thing used for 3 rooms. We barely used one tank. I don't know why some people are having very different experiences. The dirty water was very dark and shows you just how much your regular mop missed. My only complaint would be that you can't really clean close to edges of rooms.. Overall very happy with purchase.",
Amazonian,3.0 out of 5 stars,Died in 2 years. Not worth the cost.,the United States,14-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,,"I bought this machine direct from Bissell's website. My overall experience with it was not very impressive. It definitely will leave muddy streaks while you're mopping. It also would build up dirt behind the squeegee on the bottom that would add more mess to the streaking. It seemed to have trouble spraying liquid out of the right spray nozzle which caused dirt to build up on the inner right side of the shield and the fuzzy roller. I took it apart and cleaned it a million times but it never got better. I still worked with it, only able to work from left to right to be able to clean up the streaks as they happened.Finally, i believe I fell victim to the rumored faulty suction pump belt. My machine completely lost suction. I have used a regular bucket and mop the last two times I've cleaned my floors and my back has been killing me again.I'm currently looking into alternatives. Possibly a spin mop? I don't know yet.Overall, I loved the concept of a wet vac for indoors, but this was a poorly executed attempt. Sorry Bissell. I also own a Bissell Steam mop and carpet shampooer and they have out performed and out lasted this by a long shot.",One
N,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really works great,the United States,22-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,,"I received this 2 in 1 appliance as a gift and I am so impressed. It's easy to clean and the entire kitchen was able to get cleaned on a full tank. I'm not a decent sweeper so I always leave trash / fur behind and moping was a nightmare with the traditional mop and bucket. I had to refill mop bucket several times and the area would still look as if I done nothing. It made me just want to get rid of the furry pet kids. But now clean up was noticable clean and super easy too. I never seen my white floors look this clean since the week the vinyl was installed. I can even clean the rolling brushes due to that special tray feature Bissell included. All I had to do was put the gadget together which was just the handle, clean water jug and the filter and the dirty water container it only took about 3 mins and no tools needed. I filled the jug to the water line for large areas then I added the included cleaning solution to the solution fill line plugged it up and put my foot on the vac's head and tilted the handle back then pressed the bare floor button and squeezed the button under the handle for 10 secs then I started mopping and vacuuming. I would remove my finger from the button underneath the handle at times just to give the water sprayer a break from spraying the floor and releasing that button also allows the machine to suck up the excess water from the floor which is hardly any. I also had a fan blowing on the floor as I mopped and the floor wasn't even wet looking but it was extremely clean.  Then when I was done I put the vac in it's tray, poured hot water into the tray's bucket holster and then I tilted the vac handle back and pressed bare floor button and it started spinning while inside the cradle tray so it could clean the brush. I done that twice I even pressed the button under the handle for 2 secs so it could release some solution into the tray so brush could get a better cleaning then I let the button go and it sucked all the water up from the cradle. Then I turned it off and opened the front part of the vac/moo's face and removed the freshly cleaned brush and placed it into it's holding tray/cradle.  I wiped the inside of the vac's face where the brush rolls so fur and debray won't sit and harden up then snapped it back shut. I also cleaned the filter and dirty water container too which was super easy aswell. I admit this was a very nice gift for me since I don't sweep or mop my floors that well. I was so happy to see all the dog kibbles and fur get sucked up in this machine. This Crosswave Pet pro actually works well.Cons- the edges don't get cleaned I have to do them with a rag and bucket or a regular mop. Also, the bigger dog food kibbles don't fit under the vac so I have to sweep them up with a broom. If only it was a feature to adjust the vac's wheels height and was able to do edges of would be perfectoThose 2 flaws don't bother me too much and it's still a great machine.",One
Beth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice start - we'll see how it does through time,the United States,1-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,,"NOTE:  I'll be updating this review occasionally to keep it current.UPDATE:  I've had this for two years and eight months. It's stood up fairly well to five dogs, one cat, and me. One side doesn't spray the solution anymore, but it's still limping along (beats the daylights out of the multiple hoover floormates I had before). It probably won't last the full five years as per the warranty, so I probably need to check that out and see what Bissell will still cover at this point.UPDATE: I've had this for a month.  I really like how light weight and extremely maneuverable it is (very different from the Hoover Floormate). You can go around corners and curves with it very easily.  Another plus - it's very economical with its use of cleaner, so the solution lasts a good while before I have to refill the tank.  I was worried about that at first and thought it might not do a good job of cleaning, but I was wrong - it does a great job.  It also does a good job of vacuuming up excess water, so it doesn't take long for the floor to dry.Original Review:I have four dogs and one foster, so having a good wet/dry vac is a necessity. Previously I've purchased three Hoover Floormate models (and got a fourth free in exchange for one that malfunctioned) that had no available warranties.  Those lasted anywhere from 3 to 15 months each, and were not repairable. I have lost all patience with paying what I view as a lot of money for something that breaks down so easily, so now I am trying the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro.  It costs more, but with a five year warranty there's a potential cost savings compared to buying more Hoovers so I'll give it a gamble.What I can say so far:- it has a five year limited warranty- it's easy to put together right out of the box- it's light in weight and very manuverable- it is a bit fiddly when it comes to taking it apart for cleaning, but that's easy to do and doesn't take long- the package I got (with cleaner, extra brushes, etc) includes equipment that makes it easy to clean the brush while it's still attached to the machine-it sucks up mud and debris, urine, dog hair (etc) easily.  The machine is not big/heavy, so I was pleasantly surprised- it is built so that the brush can get right up against baseboards (to about 1/2"") and underneath cabinet overhangsRight now I am tentatively impressed.  We'll see how it does in the long run.  Believe me - after my experience with the Hoover floormates, if I have trouble with this machine I'll be back in a heartbeat to update this review accordingly, and discuss whether the warranty proves to be any good or not.",3
Billy B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect- cuts time in half. Hardwood or epoxy floors,the United States,16-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,,After years of vacuuming and mopping this finally came along.  All in one and cuts time in half.  With 4 dogs and hardwood floors this is a dream to have.I also use in garage on gloss epoxy floor and now at the airplane hangar with a white gloss floor that will shop all dirt.  It was a pain to keep clean and shined. This cut time by an1/3rd and about to buy a second to keep there as well.  Leaves floor with gloss shine and clean without mop streaks! Believe me a white gloss floor will show up anything!NOTE:  in a heavily soiled/dirty area (they happen) - just push area rug button for higher water flow and go a little slower to scrub/flush/vacuum soil away then return to hardwood mode and continue.  I read some review saying roller was dirty.  You were going to fast with a very heavy soiled area.  On ‘normal’ floors it’s fast.  As fast as just a vacuum and it’s already mopped now.  Leave the mop on the closet.  This does it all!!,
Camygo,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a 10 star product!,the United States,22-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,,"If in doubt, this is a must have.  I have spent the last ten years cleaning 1400+ square feet of tile and chasing four boys.  I've tried everything from steam mops, Roomba's, and everything in between.  My previous favorite was a Hoover Floormate (wet/dry vac), which only had a lifespan of one year, and was cumbersome and labor intensive to use.Nothing even comes close to comparing to the CrossWave.  The vacuum on the CrossWave works 10 x better than my $400 Dyson vacuum, and I can clean my area rugs at the same time as the wet tile floor cleaning with a quick push of a button.  What's even better, is the CrossWave does everything in one pass, and is lightweight, and easy to clean and store.  I'm getting excellent results in a quarter of the time.  Because it's so convenient and easy to use, I clean my floor every evening instead of using the Floormate once a week.The only negative, which I can completely live with is, it leaves some minor streak marks, but that is very common on the smooth surfaced tile which happens with almost every product I've ever tried.Very seldom do I find a product I can rave about, but this is it.  These opinions are my own.",

It’s fast, effective, and easy to clean up. After years of mopping- I am done. It’s not as effective for deep cleaning (I had an issue with stuck on food *toddler in house*) and larger chunks of debris, but for maintaining my floors and cleaning up crumbs, hair + barf (2 cats) , spills- it’s worth every penny. I have several area rugs and this makes it effortless to switch between modes- and all the superficial dirt came right out. I actually purchased this at a major retailer, with a protection plan because my handheld Bissell spot cleaner broke after only 2 uses. I was nervous bc some reviewers made the cleanup part seem so much worse- it literally takes minutes and I will gladly take that over having to drag a bucket and mop around.",One

Nicole Gurski,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,the United States,30-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,,"Let me start by saying that I have black textured tile floors in my kitchen that show everything - fur, water spots -  literally everything.  We have 2 high shedding dogs and a long-haired cat.  I bought this because I felt like regular mopping was not getting my floors clean.  This does an amazing job.  The floors are cleaner than they have ever been and it takes me considerably less time to clean. I've been using it for about 6 months and find that I get a consistent clean and it does a really good job at picking up dog hair and cat litter off the floor.  I've been using the Pet formula Bissell cleaner and like it for the most part.  We have a wheelchair user in the house and it's important that the floors are clean without any residue or the wheelchair tires will pick up the residue. The cleaner generally does that and I like that I can also use it on hardwood floors - makes it easy to transition to clean the rest of our house.  Other Pros - easy to clean, easy to assemble - generally all of the other things folks have stated.  Here's why I only gave 4 stars:  I'd love it if the solution was a little more powerful.  As I mentioned we have dogs.  They like to lick the floor in the kitchen.  When I clean you can see the residue of their licks on the black tile.  The cleaner doesn't get it up.  I either spray these areas with Windex or vinegar as a pre-treat. I also think that a slightly stiffer brush head for tile would be helpful to really scrub the floor (I get that you wouldn't be able to use a brush like that on hardwoods but would be nice to really scrub grout and in my case, textured tile).  I really like the self-cleaning feature and the storage/parking tray.  However, it would be nice if the storage/parking tray was on wheels.  Other improvements I'd like to see:  better edge cleaning and  better tilt for cleaning under furniture.",2
Middle-Aged Lonely Husband,4.0 out of 5 stars,Purchase at own risk,the United States,25-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,,This product works fantastic but buyer beware. It is like the Cardi B of vacuums as it gobbles and swallows anything in its path leaving nothing behind it but a slightly moist snail trail. It’s also a bit of a home wrecker (explained below). Seriously though this is a wonderful wet/dry vacuum but fellas DO NOT get one for your lady. I bought one for my beloved wife and she absolutely loves it! Possibly more than me at this point as she uses it ALL THE TIME!! The suction power is so good it has sucked up my sex life.

Also that cats litter got dumped on the floor and it took 5 runs to clean it up all the dust from the litter all the way. Other than that this is a great vacuum. Very convenient for living with a roommate that's too lazy to potty train her dog. Sucks the pee right up and cleans it very well, cleans what left over of poop after picking it up and tossing it.

MissVee,2.0 out of 5 stars,First time used and WOW!!!! EDITED: After a few months... NOT impressed. :(,the United States,24-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,,"So after a few months I unfortunately have to change my review. The brushes seem to slightly matte down or something and barely touch the floor and the mop feature does not work well at all now. I will go back and forth over and over a simple coffee spill and after 30 seconds of trying to mop it, grab a paper towel and instantly wipe it off. Floors are left dull and with dirty streaks, you have to stop and take the head off and clean it out manually every few minutes (the cleaning it with hot water in the base doesn't help with dog hair.. this was advertised for pet hair). Dog hair gets stuck all around inside the head and leaves bits of hair and dirt everywhere. It only works if the floors are already really clean.. then, what's the point!? The time it takes to stop, clean the brushes, take it apart, wipe the head out... I could have swept or vacuumed and mopped twice with traditional methods and ended up with a much cleaner floor. Now I'm stuck with 2 more payments and this things is NOT at all worth the $300+ price AT ALL. Maybe worth $49.  Super disappointed. :(Original review: Vacuum and mop in one step. Brilliant. I’m sooooooo impressed. The instructions are a bit complicated not because the machine, it’s assembly or it’s use is complicated but just lots of unfamiliar names for parts. I read through the manual and then watched a couple YouTube videos. Turns out, It’s super simple. And MAN does it clean!!! I can’t believe what it picked up. And it goes from hard floors to area rugs instantly. The brush cleaned really well. My floors are spotless. I love this thing. Hoping it is durable!!!",3
Larry,3.0 out of 5 stars,Obsessed with clean floors,the United States,19-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,,"Overall, I love my Crosswave so don't let my list of cons discourage you from buying one.  It does a great job cleaning my hardwood floors.  I use it daily to clean approximately 1000 sq ft of flooring.  I would like to see 3 design improvements in the next version of the Crosswave. 1 - the clean and dirty water tanks need to be bigger. The dirty tank has to be emptied after every 5 minutes of use.  I probably empty it 20-30 times while cleaning 1,000 sq ft of floors.  2- the dirty water tank design allows too much water to contact the filter which eventually leads to water being pulled through the motor. 3 - they're not the most durable machine I've ever owned. I've used the cross wave system for 1 year now and I'm on my 3rd machine.  Granted, my daily use probably isn't something the designers envisioned for the product though.  On the other hand, I love the Crosswave so much I've been willing to purchase 3 of them and will likely get another one as soon as my current one dies.  They're that good.",
Nacho Libra,3.0 out of 5 stars,A lot of work; I'd probably like it if I had more hard flooring,the United States,18-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"I'm not overly impressed with this. Maybe if I had more hard floors I'd like it more. I have 2 indoor cats, one long-haired and a short-haired. I have vinyl plank flooring in my kitchen, dining area and bathrooms, the rest of my condo is carpeting.This assembles easily, just snap in the handle, insert the water/formula dispenser and you're off. I used the included floor cleaner, but I was apprehensive about my cats ingesting it through walking over it, then grooming and swallowing the residue, so I went over it again with my Electrolux steamer. I'd really like to use vinegar instead, but I've read elsewhere that Bissell says you can't use vinegar in this.Honestly, it's easier for me to get out my stick vac, vacuum up the cat hair, and then use my steamer.  My steamer cleans as well as the Crosswave. There is enormous clean-up after using the Crosswave. Thankfully, every piece comes apart to get all the cat hair gunk out and it goes back together easily. There's a pan to set it in which is supposed to be used for flushing it out, but that didn't work so well, so I did it over the kitchen sink and tried to catch the cat hair before it went down the drain. There was tons of cat hair and I didn't want to call a plumber to unclog the pipes.I used it on a small 2 x 3 area rug and it had too much suction, where I had to stand on the rug to clean it and keep it from sliding around.Even though this isn't supposed to be used on carpeting, I *did* try it on a high-traffic area and it actually did a good job on picking up the imbedded dirt...While I certainly don't recommend this for a carpet cleaner (and neither does Bissell), I don't see why it can't be used on a small area that needs spot-cleaning.3-1/2 stars (I wish we could do half-star ratings) - 3 stars means ""It's OK"" on Amazon.",11
Cindy Dennis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best...floorcleaner....ever,the United States,11-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,,"This baby here may just be my most prized posession. I bought it when i was sick of sweeping, mopping, and destroying area rugs every 5 seconds having so many dogs. I regretted it when I calmed down and realized how much i just spent. Today it got delivered so I figured I'd try it (I could still send it back). Holy 💩 is all I can say. This thing is amazing. It vaccumes, sweeps, mops and cleans carpets at the push of a button. It moves seamlessly between my hardwood floors, porcelain tile, and area rugs. My floors have never been this clean. My area rug is white again. I could not believe how much hair it picked up (more than my Shark) and the joy of not sweeping, mopping, and then vaccuming and scrubbing makes me do a happy dance. Whole house swept, mopped, vacuumed and scrubbed in less than 30 min with ONE TOOL and one refill. Did I mention I have a 💩 ton of dogs, run a rescue, and its muddy out?!?! I never recommend products unless I'm blown away. But right now, im trying to decide what I love more....my Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro or my only human child (Just kidding Kaden, for now...you may want to step up your game though so it stays that way.) 🤣 Best money I have ever spent. #Bissell #gobuyit #RottieLove",6
Ellen G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!  Lifesaver!,the United States,14-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,,"I’ve had this for about 2 years and before the stay at home order had only used it to spot clean pet accidents on area rugs as I had a cleaning person who took care of the floors.  I bought it to use instead of renting a rug doctor each time and although the suction isn’t as good, it does the job on area rugs.  I like having it in the house because I don’t have the bother of renting the rug doctor and can clean up right away.  But it’s only recently that I tried it in the wood and vinyl floors .. and I’m amazed!  Its fabulous!  It skips the step of sweeping or vacuuming before you mop and does it all at once (there’s usually a ball of dust in the dirty water), and the floors are cleaner than they ever have been!  I have a short haired pet and it does fine with both of our hair!  Lifesaver!",One
ANWoodall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do you have dogs, floors, and need more time to drink wine? Buy it!",the United States,9-Feb-19,CrossWave Only,,"This review is after first use, I will update as we continue to use the machine. We have laminate flooring and two dogs, one of which is a chocolate lab that sheds as if her life depended on it. The other is a 12 year old Yorkie who knows how to play dead, give a high five, sit, lay down, and use a Pilates reformer but can’t for the life of him remember to pee outside. I like efficient. Do the job right and fast and I’m happy (insert 12 year old giggles). The pictures provided were taken 3 minutes apart. THREE! It’s easy to assemble, it picked up enough hair to knit two Chewbacca’s and it didn’t spread the dirt/hair all of the place, and it dried within minutes. It’s like a shampooer for your hard surface floored. If you’re looking for a powerful vacuum, this isn’t your jam. If you’re looking for effecincy to save you from vacuuming, mopping, then yelling at your children to stay in their freaking rooms so they don’t walk on your freshly mopped floors only to have the dogs follow you around as you mop like you’re leading a conga line, then you need this in your life! You do need to take some things apart and clean after each use, which adds another step, but you’re probably used to cleaning up after everyone anyway.Ps. I didn’t buy from amazon, so out of guilt for betraying them I felt it necessary to post my two-cents here.",4
TNR,2.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced gimmick that does insufficient job,the United States,7-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,,"I REALLY wanted this to work on my hard floors. I have mobility issues and lots of cats and dogs to care for so my routine is hard on me. I have to go around the house with a flashlight and get on my hands and knees to clean pee or puke before I vaccuum, then I have to mop and then rinse the floor.  This promised to do all of that for me AND I would never have to worry about pee or vomit getting on the brushroll of the vacuum and me needing to take the vacuum apart to clean it.  Unfortunately the unit doesn't reach the inch between it and the wall so I had to go back with my regular mop and clean there.  You can't lower it enough to get under furniture like you can with a vacuum.  It doesn't vacuum up all of the dirt, hair and debris like a vacuum does so while the floors are cleanER, they still aren't as clean as if you'd mopped and vacuumed separately.  The strainer in the dirty water container is useless.  I ended up just dumping the entire thing in my sink and letting the sink strainer catch everything.  The only positive I see to this besides not worrying about cleaning the brushroll, is that it doesn't kick up a bunch of dust because everything is wet down, so I'm not sneezing the whole time I've vacuuming. And the solution they provide is HIGHLY scented, NOT ok for people or animals. If you want to do an insufficient job with an overpriced gimmick then get this, otherwise, stick to separate vacuum and mop.  I wish this had worked as advertised.",
Adam Waddell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game. Changer.,the United States,30-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,,"This thing is amazing! I had mopped my whole house (all variations of hard floors - tile, laminate, vinyl, wood) three days before receiving my machine. My normal cleaning routine is sweep, dry mop (dust mop), wet mop. I THOUGHT my floors were clean.When I received my machine, it took less than a minute to assemble and another 2 minutes to get it filled and plugged in. I used the top option for the water/solution, and after doing my living room, kitchen, hallway, mud room, and craft room, I still had more solution left. I was AMAZED at how disgustingly nasty my floors were. There was SO much pet hair (short hair dog and two kittens) and dirt that I would have assumed had been cleaned from the thorough cleaning the less than a week before. I had to empty the tank twice (not because it was full, simply because I couldn’t stand having that nastiness in the machine) during the process. After, WOW. My floors are amazing, and this machine cleans SO easily. This is a game changer!",One
KellyK929,1.0 out of 5 stars,Super Disappointing - WANT to love it.,the United States,18-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,,"We purchased our first machine in March 2019. Used for a few months and ADORED it. Then one day it stopped sucking up the water... we did all the trouble shooting things, and reached out to customer service. In January 2020 we received our replacement. Again...worked for a bit, and then over the summer, same story. Stopped sucking up the water. Again, we did all the trouble shooting to no avail.We also purchased a Hoover PwrOne Floor cleaner...It gets the job done, but not amazing either. October 2020 we have reached out to Bissell to report that machine #2 is not working. We can clean our whole 1,900 square foot house and only suck up less than a half inch of water.For reference, we have two kids, 3 small dogs...we normally clean floors 1x week. Would do more but cannot find time. We often vaccuum first as we realize that even though this is able to double as a vaccuum, we don't want to set it up to fail. Bummed - for $400 we are disappointed that we cannot get one to work.",

J. Mason,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save Your Money,the United States,5-May-20,CrossWave Only,,"I will NEVER buy another Bissell product.  I've had 4 Bissell vacuums and carpet cleaners; and they have all been subpar.  Either they didn't perform well, or they crapped out in an unusually short time.  I bought this cleaner directly from Bissell; and it is a piece of junk.  I run the dry vacuum first; and then I use the cleaner solution.  The vacuum suction isn't powerful enough; so when I apply the cleaning solution, I end up with a muddy mess.  Furthermore, the brush on mine only spins intermittently.  (Note:  I have checked and rechecked it; and it IS installed correctly).  Lastly, taking everything apart to clean the machine takes more time than the combo vac/cleaner saves.  If I could, I'd give this product 0 start.  Save your money folks.",One
Ashley,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,the United States,31-May-21,CrossWave Only,,I'm honestly pretty disappointed with this vacuum. I really want to like it and was excited about it making cleaning a bit easier. If anything its done the opposite. I have four large dogs. So lots of hair and lots of mud and dirt being tracked in. I've tried this vacuum multiple times multiple different ways trying to troubleshoot it and no matter what I do it just does not work well. It takes much longer to clean with this than just sweeping and mopping. It streaks terribly and often isnt able to scrub off mud on the floor even with multiple passes. I've been having to go back over the floor with a mop after using this. I've tried to google solutions for these problems multiple times thinking I had to be doing something wrong with all the positive reviews this vacuum has gotten but so far none of those solutions I've found have worked.,
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not perfect, but a good machine.",the United States,13-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,,"I bought this machine for one purpose. I hated spending time sweeping and mopping my laminate floors daily or every other day. It does save time, and I'm satisfied but it's not without pros and cons.Pros:-elimates two separate chores of sweeping amd mopping, instead just one chore of  running this gadget. Does a fairly good job so long as you aren't vacuuming up large pieces of cereal or nails or something.-fairly long chord-handles hair okay. (I have a German Shepard mix, and 3 cats. Short hair, but a lot of shedding. Picks up hair alright).-can use on area rugs.-does good on fresh messes and spillsCons-if you use too much cleaner, it streaks on your floor. Easily fixable with a few extra passes on the machine with suction only on, and no extra cleaner dispensing but happens easily and often.-a lot of parts to take apart and clean. 5 separate parts to clean, and it can be a pain if they are all filled with dog hair.-doesnt eliminate mopping completely as this machine has a hard time getting close to edges, but can reduce the chore to monthly or bimonthly if you are using this to maintain clean floors multiple times a week.-has no intense elbow grease scrubbing action, so it doesn't do well stuck on messes which have been there for a period of timeAll in all I am satisfied, it definitely saves time on sweeping and mopping turning a 20 to 30 minute chore to 10 minutes for me (depending on the size of your home of course), but there are improvements that can be made.",
Nate L,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work!,the United States,17-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,,I have a black lab so we have ALOT of hair dog hair and with a baby on the way I wanted a GREAT pet vacuum that got all the hair from the rug and this is NOT IT! At first it worked fine but now after 7 months or so it gets clogged all the time in the little tunnel that goes from the brush to the dirty tank and we have to stop about 15 times to empty it.. it just stops sucking up any hair and rolls it into balls instead! In this video I had cleaned out the tank and put a new brush on and it STILL didn't work.

Brianna Jones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of time & money,the United States,9-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,,"For the mount of money I’d rather Clean on my hands & knees & know my floor is clean.Received one week ago & I’ve only used twice. Today I notice that it doesn’t get off any stains or dried spots.There were multiple marks I had to actually stop & wipe with a rag.Also, the spray only came from the sides, there was no spray from the middle. So part of my floor wasn’t even cleaned.& last but not least I had to go over the same area so many times to get the water off my floor. So much more time consuming than just washing my floors by hand.The pro to this machine is than the vacuum function works quite well on both hard floors & rugs.

erccrn,4.0 out of 5 stars,Loving mine,the United States,31-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,,"I purchased mine about 6 months ago. I read a lot of the reviews before buying. I have 6 dogs. I use it at least once a week. No issues with suction- it's better than some of the traditional vacuums I've owned. It doesn't put a lot of water down so you aren't over saturating your floors. However since it doesn't put a lot of fluid down you need to do a small area and then move on- once you get the hang of it it's fast. I stop and clean my roller brushes based on the yuk factor I'm seeing when I go over the floors. I noted a review where someone complained about mildew- you are supposed to remove the brush after use so it dries out- no problems with mildew. Good long cord so I can cover a large area without unplugging so often. Nice slim head so I can get next to toilets easily. If I have a sticky or dried on area I just push the area carpet button and it seems to loosen it well. Cleaning the debris cup is no worse than squeezing out a dirty sponge ( noted many people who complained they didn't want to touch dirt. Since I can't afford to hire a house cleaner I'm fine with pulling dog hair off the filter). I also bought a brush head package with a carpet brush and an additional multisurface brush. Bear in mind this is NOT a deep carpet cleaner- it will work to remove surface stains on a rug though ( doggie accident tests), but I would suggest you use a traditional vacuum on a wall to wall carpet before spot cleaning especially if you have pets who shed.I'm very happy with mine and have recommended it to friends and family.",3
IMHO,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A little disgusting to maintain, but soooooo worth it",the United States,14-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,,"On the one hand, I love to clean.  I find transforming gross, dirty things into shiny, sparkly ones deeply satisfying.  On the other hand, I’m also kind of lazy.  Often the effort of vacuuming, then mopping, didn’t seem worth the payoff. And having wet floors for 30-45 minutes added to the burden.  This machine solves these problems. It picks up most dirt, and washes my tile and wood floors really well.  ALL AT THE SAME TIME. It doesn’t get into deep corners or tight spaces, so I still have to do normal vacuuming once or twice a month. But watching this thing zoom over a dusty, pet-hair covered surface and leave a clean, only slightly damp floor in its wake is pure joy.  The downside is that it’s kind of disgusting to empty out the dirty water and all the junk the Bissell picked up.  But even worse is emptying it after letting it sit a couple days.  That is VILE.  So if you’re so lazy you can’t manage to empty it within 24 hours of use, the Bissell can’t help you.  I bought a remanufactured unit for about 1/3 of the price at an outlet place.

Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not exactly a fantastic solution to cleaning,the United States,8-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,,"1- wife bought it I use it2 - My rating system that some vendors don't seem to like that they write asking me to raise it.

Pretty much too close to call.Why a 2 - The unit is heavy and awkward to maneuver. It is iarge and won't get into small areas and a pain to use in a small room. It's a PIA to clean when you are through you have to take all the components out, dig pet  hair and such out at least rinse every thing making sure you aren't dumping stuff into the sink that will clog the drain. Remember your picking pet hair, grit, dirt with the unit. Not good to dump down the drain. Old fashion Vac and mop - vacuum up dirt dump in waste basket. Mop take the head off throw in washing machine.

Yellow 11,1.0 out of 5 stars,WORST VACUUM EVER-DO NOT BUY,the United States,20-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,,"I had very high hopes after watching an infomercial on this vacuum. I ordered the vacuum and many “extras”. I have only used this vacuum 4 times and have given it away. This is the WORST vacuum I have ever owned, ever! This is NOT a vacuum for families with kids OR pets!! This gets tiny particles up, but dog food like the commercial?! NO. Dog hair like the commercial?? NO. All this “vacuum” does is push the hair around and clump it together from the rollers. As you can see from the pictures I submitted, it picks nothing up...just balls it up and clumps it together. I have tried every roller, I’ve read instructions thoroughly, contacted bissell directly to see if there was any chance I could be doing something wrong...as I suspected, it wasn’t me...it was this “vacuum” I have two giant breed dogs with under coats, I gave this to a neighbor with a small 8 lb dog that sheds the long strands instead of clumps like my dogs and my neighbor said the same thing...it doesn’t pick up any hairs or any pieces. I have always used Shark and I guess I’m spoiled by the intense suction from the shark. I wanted to try this vacuum because of the dual mop feature it has, which I never even used. I was so angry they claimed so many things with this vacuum that are definitely not true. If you like a vacuum to do what it is supposed to, DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!! WORST PRODUCT EVER! Shame on Bissell for charging so much for a literal piece of garbage. I can’t even give this thing away, that’s how useless it is",
Schmitty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Video is False Advertising. Cleaning machine after is each use is WAY more involved.,the United States,7-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,,"Buyer beware. The video is blatant false advertising. It shows a woman emptying the water tank, doing a tray cleaning then walking away. But I just got my machine and the instructions are WAY more involved than the video shows. You have to disassemble, rinse, and set out to dry (dedicate a space in your home) all four pieces of the dirty water tank before you can reassemble. Then you have to remove the roll and rinse it under running water, rinse the brush roll window, and wipe out the brush roll area. After all that is dry you can reassemble and put the machine away. So you are not going to be “done” cleaning your floors for hours and you have to dedicate more space in your home than just the footprint of the machine.

Christine L. Morris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cuts through the dirt,the United States,23-May-21,CrossWave Only,,"Unbeatable for cutting through layers of dirt. We live in Florida with 2 dogs and kids that track in endless dirt. We vacuum several times a week and mop weekly and I was looking for a tool to cut down the vacuum/mop time.  I was shocked at how dirty my floors were...judging by the color of the water (mud? Sludge?) after the first...and second use of this. I had no idea our vacuuming/mopping wasn’t picking everything up and I was torn between being excited over the cross wave and fully embarrassed about how dirty our floors had been.  I’ve now used this for both hard floors and area rugs and below are my opinions on pros/cons:Pros:- picks up more dirt than a standard microfiber mop- is light and easily maneuverable, requiring less effort than a regular vacuum or mop- easy to clean, especially using the docking tray to clean the brushes (this still got more dirt out of the brushes after I had cleaned them in the sink);  Wet dog hair easily wipes off all parts (brush cover, internal suction hose) and the pet hair filter is a nice touch- water container is clearly marked so you know how much water/solution to use- built-in overflow indicator stops the brushes/suction when the dirty tank is full so you know to empty itCons:- doesn’t get all the way to the edges, leaves about 1.5 inches along all walls that need to be wiped down with a rag. this was most pronounced when first using the cross wave (and cutting through the unexpected grime)...hasn’t been as pronounced an issue since- cleanup is a bit messy, but anything with water and dirt will be.- not really a con, but a point to note: the cross wave is not really meant to be a daily dry vacuum, though it may work ok as one in small spaces. It has no attachments/hand tools. Furniture, carpet, and regular vacuuming are likely best handled by a regular vacuum.I did not buy this on Amazon (had a discount price through a red box store), but purchase the pet multi surface cleaner through Amazon. We have tile and hard wood, and that cleaner works well on both.",

I have only used it once, but it was such an easier process, as well as it produced much better results.  The floor was actually clean!  Not like, sort of clean, where you can use 3 different Swiffer pads and still get dirt up.Cleaning the machine afterward was actually pretty easy too.  As I cleaned the floor and emptied the dirty water chamber, it was amazing to see the fur, grass, and dirt which came up.  But at the end, cleaning the machine was easy too, everything pretty much clicks out, and I think anyone with a bit of sense could figure it out.If you're hesitating to spend the money, just do it, this thing will make life much easier for you, and much cleaner.",
ab,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cuts cleaning time in half,the United States,1-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,,"I love this machine. When I saw it in the store, I had no idea something amazing actually existed. So I looked for it on Amazon. And then I looked for it at Bed, Bath and Beyond. I found it at BBB for about $30 more, but I was able to use a 20% off coupon, which ultimately made it cheaper there. So keep that in mind.This truly cut my time cleaning in half. We have two dogs. One is a geriatric beagle who sheds a lot but pees a lot more. The other is a 6 year old mutt who sheds like there is no tomorrow. I vacuum our hardwood floors incessantly, and still there are rolling tumbleweeds of dog hair. Then the mud and everything everywhere ... Sweeping it all up gets everything all gross and dusty. This truly cuts my cleaning time in half, it may even take less time than that! My husband came home from work, and he thought I had slaved away all day. I did not correct him. ;)There are two little cons I can speak to, but they aren't significant.1. Doesn't scrub up to the corners / ends of the baseboards, but I just swiffer the edges, the corners, and under my appliances quickly when I am done.2. If you wet on first swipe, sometimes you matte the hair down and it all doesn't get sucked up. Honestly, its much less hair than when I was vacuuming and mopping in two different steps. And the hair left afterward isn't that significant, and it can very easily be wiped up, dry swiffered up, but it is not very noticeable, so I only do that in areas where I can see it. Even doing this, my time is halved.",One
AlyMay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest Review!,the United States,19-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,,"If you have lots of carpet this is not the machine for you. If you’re like me and your house is mostly laminate or hardwood flooring then this machine will change the way you clean your floors!Pros:-Great for laminate/linoleum/hardwood flooring-One step cleaning: vacuums and mops!-Machine is always using clean water on your floors while the dirty water goes in a separate bin.-The crosswave alone does better than the vacuum/swiffer/swiffer wet/ steam mop combo I was doing previously.-One full container of the water and cleaning solution is enough for 3 rooms. If I’m doing a quick clean it’s enough for the whole house!-It really deep cleans your floors. My flooring has tiny grooves in it to mimic hardwood and this machine can get into them.-Great for getting up dry and wet messes! I’ve vacuumed up dog food and ice cream!-Great customer serviceCons:-Difficult to get corners and edges. You will have to spot clean using other methods for certain small areas.-I had to replace a part right out of the box. The container used for the cleaning solution would not tighten correctly. This caused all the water to spill out over the floor. But to Bissell’s credit they very promptly sent me a free brand new container and top that works perfectly.-It doesn’t work as well as a dry vacuum. It’s much better if you just use it for its intended purpose, wet vacuuming.-It works on carpets and does “shampoo” them but I wouldn’t recommend this vacuum is you’re house is primarily carpet. I think it’s better suited for hard floors and rugs.See attached pictures of results! Left is before, right is after. One pic is where I dropped ice cream all over the floor and then used the vacuum to get it up! Another pic shows you a light line surrounded by darker floor. That’s where I left the vacuum for 10 seconds to show you the difference the vacuum makes!!!!Also - extra tidbitIn-between (can be a con but maybe to only certain people):-If you want a deep clean you have to take your time with this machine. If you just roll it over your floor quickly it’ll clean it but not deep clean. Advice for a good deep clean: push forward with the vacuum to lay out the cleaning solution and then very slowly bring it back toward you going over the same spot. It’ll suck up the dirty water while also giving the brush time to really clean the floor.",

My first use was so awesome and pleased I paid the price and wished I had gotten a long time ago. I cleaned up just as instructions said to. My second time using it I did some general dusty tile vacuuming first then started to use the clean solution just as I did the first time. Only this time every push with the vacuume even without releasing anymore cleaning solution i left a muddy track behind. I was so confused. I cleaned everything exactly like the book and checked the trouble shooting tips. I started over with a never used brush roll. Again but not as muddy I left a wet dirt streak behind the vacuume. By this time I figure I'm not able to return it as its been awhile since I purchased it. So stuck with a disappointment purchase that im not able to use.,

I ordered mine straight from Bissell since amazon was out of stock but it’s the same thing! I have all vinyl wood and tile floors with a couple runner rugs in my house. Zero carpet. I have a Roomba I run everyday and have been using a Swiffer and Bona mop over the years. During quarantine I fell and broke my foot and spent a lot more time at home than I ever had. I have come to realize my floors might not be as clean as they could be. I shopped and asked around as to the best vacuum mop combo and this was the clear winner so I gave it a shot. Let me tell you, I have had it for three days now and I am OBSESSED. I can’t believe how well it works. It is everything I hoped for. I’ve even packed it up to take it to my sister’s to do her house. Yes you are going to be amazed at what you get off yours floors and out of your rugs. If you’re on the fence.... do it. Do it now.",One
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,this is the best vacuum I've ever owned,the United States,29-Jul-18,CrossWave Only,,"Overall, this is the best vacuum I've ever owned.  I have 2 dogs and LOTS of dog hair.  This little wet vac is amazing at mopping and vacuuming the floors, and I love that it can also shampoo and vacuum the carpet.  It's a great fit for a small apartment with pets and a mix of laminate and carpet floors.  HOWEVER... I gave it four stars because I really wish it had a couple things.1. A hand vac attachment.  I have pet hair all over my bed and sofa.  There's no hand attachment, so I had to buy a small cordless hand vac.2. A retractable cord.  My old vacuum had a retractable cord that automatically sucked back into the vacuum when you pushed a lever.  That was nice.  I hate having to gather up the cord.A few other comments: This vacuum seems like it will last longer than others because you can take it completely apart and clean every piece.  My last vacuum stopped working when it got clogged with dog hair and I couldn't clean it out, so it lost suction.  I don't think that will be an issue with this vacuum.  Of course, that also means that you have to completely take it apart and clean it after you vacuum, which takes more time.  BUT at least you can maintain your vacuum so it keeps working.This vacuum actually sucked up all the dog hair off my carpet, so that was amazing.  And it did a decent job of shampooing the carpet as well.  Overall, I was very happy with the amount of dog hair it cleaned up.",One
Flutterby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning floors is now both easy and fun!,the United States,15-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,,"All my common areas and bathrooms were tiled 7 years ago to help allergy issues.  We have 2 potty training toddlers, and 3 little yippy dogs with tiny bladders. So, I'm constantly having to clean up messes from muddy/dirty foot traffic, random food spills, crafting explosions, to potty puddles. It's exhausting...At least it was exhausting. Now that my husband broke down and bought me a Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro my floors are finally clean. And not just clean, but easy to keep clean. The tank makes it easy to mix the proper dilution so that you aren't leaving any residue.Just today in the time it took to cook white rice I was able to clean an oil spill in the kitchen and mud tracks  in the playroom. Then after dinner I cleaned the living room floor where my daughter made a mess trying to use her play kitchen as a real one. And the machine clean up is literally no more than 5 minutes.Before this Bissell I would have just picked up what I could see and have to spend a couple hours the next day sweeping, mopping, changing out water, and then cleaning my mop and bucket. And my floors would still feel sticky.To be honest, this is the first time my floors have truly felt clean in years. I'm actually excited about cleaning.",One
Jeff,5.0 out of 5 stars,This vacuum does a surprisingly good job at wet/dry cleaning on tile and area rugs,the United States,12-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,,"This vacuum does a surprisingly good job at wet/dry cleaning on tile and area rugs. I wasn't sure whether to trust it at first, because the idea of vacuuming up dry hair while wetting the surface seems counter-intuitive. Wouldn't the hair just stick to the roller?  But it doesn't. At least, not usually.  As the owner of a 75-lb Husky/Shepherd mix that's currently shedding like crazy, I put the vacuum to the test against the regularly appearing tumbleweeds of hair that collect almost immediately around the baseboards of the tiled areas of the house. Some of the bigger ones, no doubt formed by multiple smaller tumbleweeds coalescing into one giant replica of Cousin It, were a bit too big to make it past the roller, so it just kind of curled up behind it. That said, it was easy to pick up when the vacuum left it behind.The combination of the spray and the fabric roller did a great job of cleaning the tile, and it worked well on a small rug as well, although the suction was such that it really wanted to just lift it off the ground (this was basically a doormat-sized rug). When you're done, you have a rather gross dirt/sludge/hair mixture in the canister. Thankfully, they thought to include a perforated floor in the canister that can be easily pulled out, taking all of the solid matter out while letting the liquid drain through the holes to the bottom. This lets you throw away the solid stuff and then dump the remaining liquid as you see fit.Overall, it's a time saver. You could vacuum the tile areas and then go back to mop, or you can do both at once. I'll take the latter any day.",One
Lieselotte Bayer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars and then some !!!!,the United States,9-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,,"I have been dealing for over 12 years with several products to get my Greyhound mix's heavy  hair loss under control (other than brushing the dog of course) and it has been a struggle. Anything from traditional mop and bucket, broom  and dry air vacuum nothing worked to my satisfaction. I cleaned the floor one day,  dried around my dogs water bowl the next day and the paper towel was dirty.Than I watched a Bissell  TV commercial one day and really liked the idea of the vet  vacuum and despite some negative to disastrous reviews of some folks  I decided to buy it and could not be happier. I have had the vacuum for 3 months now and am loving it . It keeps all the promises, is easy to use, I love the options of hard floor and rugs.I still have carpet in my living room and bedrooms, but vinyl  and throw rugs in the kitchen and both bathrooms and it is amazing how it cleans.First of all it saves step number one, sweeping the floors before cleaning, because the machine does it for you in one step. It is so easy to  push the lever , watch the bubbles coming up, vacuuming up and down a few rows, release the trigger and go over the same rows again to vacuum up the water and it works just great.I have never experienced any water streaks or puddles  at all. Quite the opposite and another bonus that I have never heard mentioned before, as time goes on and I use the vacuum more often the floor begins to shine, with just the recommended cleaning  formula. I can switch from hard floor to area rug and take care of the kitchen floor and throw rugs in no time.Once I am done, I take the tank , the roller brush and other attachments out in to the yard,  rinse  everything with a garden hose, dry it and snap it back on. I bought a small thin bendable bottle cleaner brush  to get the dog's hair out of the  inside area where the dirty water tank sits - and that's it, ready for the next use.",
Eeper,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the Hoover Floormate,the United States,5-Oct-18,CrossWave Only,,"I have beige ceramic tiles with almond-colored grout in my kitchen and hallway. It’s a nightmare to keep the grout clean. Mopping is no good, because the dirty water gets into the grout and eventually turns it black. I’ve been using the Hoover Floormate for years...I’m on my third one, which has lasted 8 years. Only the first one I had picked up all the water from the floor. I’ve also tried steam mops, as well as an unwieldy Dyson floor scrubber that kept falling apart. I’ve been waiting for something new to come out and got a deal on the Bissel Crosswave Pet Pro that included extra brushes and the area rug brush. I used the Bissel for the first time today and I really like it. It has a swivel head, which makes it easier to maneuver than the Hoover and it’s not as heavy. I used the area rug brush first because I heard that it was really good for grout (my grout is really currently ready for a good professional cleaning and reseal), then followed it up with the all purpose pet brush. It did a better cleaning job than the Hoover and picked up more water and crunbs. I suspect it will pick up more and more of the residual dirt in the grout the more I use it. It also cleaned out better than the Hoover. I’m happy.",One
Barbara Page,5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST tile floor cleaner ever seen!,the United States,14-May-20,CrossWave Only,,"Two weeks ago I bought a Hoover ONEPWR cordless and returned it after first use. (will write a review on that)  Then I bought this Bissell and was so amazed by its ease and efficiency!  Did all my tile in kitchen, dining room, family room, hallways and bathrooms. Had to empty the dirty water collector midway, but the cleaning solution lasted the entire time with some left over. The brush roller has interspersed stiffer scrubbing pieces that remove ground-in-dirt but do not scratch.  The suction was strong, sucking up particles and even some dry pet food. Only downside is that there is about ¼"" where tile meets baseboard that has to be cleaned by hand as the wet roller cannot get that close;  however the vacuum pulls in anything loose in those areas. It does such a good job, that the ¼"" for hand cleaning would only be necessary periodically, and not every time. After the job, a very easy clean up with a strainer that lifts out hair and particles from the dirty water;  then easy rinse of removable parts and set them to air dry.  This purchase was bit of a splurge for me but worth every penny!  My floors have never looked this good!",
M.C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Everything gets stuck in the neck of the vacuum,the United States,30-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,,"I really can't reccomend that you not buy this model enough. For the money that we spent on this, we could have purchased a robo vacuum, dyson, or another pet vacuum.This vacuum is advertised as a wet/dry vacuum and that there is no need to vacuum before hand. I'm not a naive person and can handle the fact that was likely not true, especially given the fact that I have three dogs. I really wanted to love this vacuum and initially did as a vacuum but as soon as I tried to use it as a mop everything that could go wrong has.  The design is flawed and because it designed to be quick dry, it uses minimal water.  It doesn't use enough water to actually push the dirt back up into the waste chamber and instead it basically creates mud that gets stuck in the bend of the vacuum.  Now couple that with any amount of pet hair and you can imagine what a nightmare it is to clean.  When you receive the product, the instructions do state to clean it inbetween every use but this goes beyond that. I have to stop frequently while using it to disassemble and clean it in order to be able to use it.I have never been able to use it as a mop and when I tried to use it to clean a rug as it was advertised, it actually ruined the rug because of the aforementioned water issue. I had to get a seperate carpet cleaner to clean the rug after attempting to clean the rug twice with this.I could even deal with not being able to use it as a mop and just use it as a vacuum except if you accidently hit the trigger while vacuuming, you've now caused moisture and will have to disamble it, wait for the entire thing to dry before you can use it again as a vacuum.I have only hardwood/tile and three dogs. We sweep/vacuum 2-3 times a week, so this isn't a matter of expecting miracles but I've now spent hundreds on a vacuum that doesn't work and I still have to use a broom/dustpan and swiffer.We thought something might be wrong with the particular one we recieved so we contacted bissell about warranty and they informed us that it was under warranty for three years. Awesome! That's great news! They told us we can take it somewhere local. Even better! They gave us a list of places we could take it to. The first two places no longer do repairs one their behalf and the first one had really unflattering things to say about this model and bissell and the third one is only open during hours I work which makes it impossible for me to drop it off.  At this point I don't know what to do and more than anything I just wish I had purchased anything else, even just another model from bissell.",

yeehawranch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't be fooled by the ""Pet Pro""",the United States,31-May-20,CrossWave Only,,"If you have dogs that shed, this is not the vacuum for you.  I'm so sorry I bought this based on a friend's recommendation after my Dyson died.  I have two Labradors, hardwood floors, and one large area rug.  Needless to say, vacuuming is a daily chore in my house.  Not only do I have to clean out the reservoir two times while vacuuming just the downstairs, the vacuum is poorly designed so hair gets jammed up between the brush and the reservoir and won't pick up anything.  Once that is cleaned out, the vacuum works OK, but I guess I got spoiled with my 15 year old Dyson, which didn't need to be taken completely apart and cleaned out every five minutes.  Save up your money and just go with the Dyson.On the plus side, this is a lightweight vacuum, so hauling it up and down the stairs is easy.  I think it would be an OK vacuum if I didn't need it to vacuum up pet hair.Also, I didn't buy from Amazon, I purchased directly from Bissell and when I called to try and find out if there was something wrong with the vacuum, I was pointed to YouTube videos rather than walked through the cleaning process by their customer service.  I will never buy another Bissell product again.",

They are the type of people who do not take care of their 25 dollar vacuum.

Rugs were  damp but not wet,. Marble floors no streaks and it sets in my klitchen on the tray they sent.

It failed miserably. I have two dogs and laminate floors and wanted something lighter weight than the Floormate. From the beginning, the Crosswave did not have good suction. I fill the tank to mop a large area and when I finish cleaning there is barely any water in the dirty tank. While it was still under warranty, I took it to a repair shop who did nothing—it came back the same. I’ve replaced the brush roll and the filter and it still performs poorly. I’m meticulous about cleaning it after use (which is gross, by the way).

I have laminate, hard wood and tile. And I have 7 cats!! This thing is perfect for dust bunnies, hair, litter, kibble, dried cat puke and crumbs!  It doesn't work on carpet so don't bother even though it says it can. I use it on very thin throw mats but that's it.  Dried messes need a bit of elbow grease but most come right up. I use Pine Sol or bleach depending on the floor. It has saved me so much time cleaning now.  You do have to maintain it -- clean the brush roll periodically. It does a really good job of sucking up the hair and not wrapping around the roll. My only complaint would be that getting under tables is tough because the head doesn't swivel the best.

Amanda D,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so exicted for this, but it's just not keeping up.",the United States,11-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,"I was so so very excited for this product. I saved up my money for it, researched different models and brands (thought i had good information), but this crosswave simply isn't doing what it promised. I have a sub 1200sqft home with 2 dogs, 2 cats, and a teenager. I clean my floors daily.  Like many other reviewers, I loved this product in the beginning. I believe though, it was puppy love and I was more in love of the idea of the product. I'll give it credit though, it does pick up more fur and dirt than I even knew I had! The machine itself is fairly easy to disassemble for cleaning, the clean tank and the dirty tank lasts me the entire house. It's light weight and easy to maneuver.Now for the downsides. Honestly, there's a number of design flaws. The biggest being the beater bar located behind the vacuum and roller assembly. This bar picks up more dirt and fur than the vacuum itself. It's effectively just spreading around the dirt leaving me with still dirty floors. I can see the specks and streaks of it even after passing over the same spot multiple times. It builds up so quickly that I feel as if i need to stop and wipe it does every few passes, but instead I do it after every room i clean. Similarly, the vacuum and slip on roller guard collect the dirt/fur, causing them to clog easily. the wheels also get dirt/fur caught in them, making them so that they don't turn. At the end of the cleaning session, more dirt/fur has to be removed from the beater bar, inside of the roller gaurd, and unclogged from the vacuum, than is even picked up and sucked into the dirty tank. As a side note, it'd be great if Bissel made the componets (dirty tank especially) dishwasher safe. Overall, I just want my money back. I don't mind cleaning the machine after each use, that's expected; but I shouldn't have to clean it every 100 sqft or so to make it work properly. Bissel - please do better. Test your products in a real world situation before claiming it's better or ""for pets"".",
dezgie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and it works.,the United States,7-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,,"My husband did his research and eventually purchased the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro about a year ago or so. We loved it from the start. He didn't keep up with the floors and they went way too long before I finally picked it up and went to town! The task we set for this little cleaner was (and still is) huge! Our kitchen floor is still plain plywood, not finished, no permanent flooring laid on it, just regular plywood that absorbs all the smelly gooey gross things spilled on it and dragged in from outside by the dogs or by us. Our oldest dog (he passed away 2 months ago) was an American Bulldog. Over the last 6 months or so, he started to lose his ability to hold it and the messes were huge (we couldn't always get him out the door fast enough). Swiffers are fine and all, but on unfinished floors, they can shred. Anyway, I used the Crosswave on the plywood floor and it did an amazing job. I had to go slowly, but that's expected considering the level of ground in crud that was there. Maintaining the floor should be much quicker. It's easy to clean up and clean out. Someone mentioned that it's gross to clean out. Yep, it is. Dirt can be gross. Dirt mixed with water and cleaning solution turns to mud and yep, it's gross. The stuff has to go somewhere when it's sucked up into the machine. The only reason it might not be gross is if you are starting off with a clean floor, but if I was doing that, I wouldn't need this thing ;-). As for cleaning out the waste water chamber, it's easy. Push the button to remove it from the mop, dump it out (I dumped most of in off to the side in the yard for the worst of it) and rinse it off. The filter is small and simple enough to rinse out. I soaked it in Mr. Clean and some warm water when it got smelly, and that worked like a charm. I used the tray to clean the brush and I'll likely remove the brush later to give it a good cleaning now. The solution container, again, simple to use. Pull it out, add water to the fill line and add solution to the solution fill line and plunk it back in and start cleaning. The Bissell cleaning solution has a nice fresh scent to it and did a reasonable job (it probably kicks butt on a finished floor). I used a bit of Mr. Clean on the worst of the worst, but again, the floor I was/am cleaning was absolutely horrendous. Now that it's finally scrubbed up, I'm looking forward to keeping after it on a weekly basis with this machine.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat! Replacement brushes and filters aren't terribly expensive either. All around, this thing kicks butt and does way more than we ever expected it to. Maybe one of these days we'll actually put a real floor down and save some cleaning headaches!",One
Sheila Ronning,1.0 out of 5 stars,No no no.  I do NOT recommend.,the United States,3-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,,"First, you need to clean the machine after each time you use it.

Fifth, I have carpet in the bedroom and a large rug in the living room and this does not work on either.  Good thing I kept my old vacuum for those areas but having two floor machines along with a broom and mop (because you will still need them!!) in an apartment is ridiculous.  When I really want clean hardwood floors, sweeping and mopping trumps this machine every time.  This was an expensive mistake and I am pretty sure I am way past any return policy!

Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it to me...,the United States,10-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,,"So I really hesitated upon purchase after reading some of these reviews, but I’m glad I bought this thing. I have two German Shepherds, two cats, and live in the PNW where it rains a lot. My hardwood floors get very dirty. It does come with some quirks which I will mention down below. I would prefer this to a broom, dustpan, and mop. It works really well on SHORT carpet that is not thick. It is also not what I would consider a deep cleaning tool, but for everyday use. If you use it everyday or every other day, then you won’t have to worry about build up and deep cleaning. I’m fortunate that I can do this.Things to keep in consideration when using and why I docked a star-•Remove the brush to rinse off in the sink prior to using for mopping, or you can even switch out to the second clean one you have.• You also should take the canister off the vacuum and dump out the dirt and hair in the garbage and rinse out in sink. THEN it will effectively work to mop your floors. IF you don’t do this you get brown muddy streaks everywhere.•There are extra steps to using this but I don’t mind them when I have as much dog hair and dirt in my house as I do. Instead of “priming” in its dock thing, I just pulled apart and repeated the above steps to clean it.UPDATE February 2021- it works well if you baby it. Change the brush and filters. Keep them clean in between changing them out. I now have a kid that crawls everywhere. I vacuum with this twice a day and it does a good job on the hardwood and SHORT carpet we have. With two long haired dogs and two cats, I have a lot of pet hair and dirt. If you take care of the vacuum it works well.",

I've literally purchased SEVEN of these machines, this one I was using was a replacement by Bissell as it had stopped working during the warranty, so after a few months, it stopped sucking water and it no longer under warranty.  You need to FREQUENTLY clean the rollers and bottom, 3 or 4 times during use to keep the floor from getting dirty again.  Clean filter frequently.  I have to flush the dirty water because it is not good to pour sludge in any sink.  I have 4 cats and 2 dogs so there is always a lot of hair even though I vacuum prior to using it.

Pamela S Worrell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, just wow!",the United States,17-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,,"Initiated our new Bissell crosswave pet pro floor cleaner.  We have a ton of dogs and red clay soil.  Our hard floors get hammered, especially when it's muddy outside.  I bought this machine hoping it would work  half what the reviews said it would.  Well, just finished pretty much all the living area with it.  I used one full clean water tank full.  I only had to move to two outlets, thanks to the super long cord.  I have real oak hardwood, cheap laminate, and high quality composite flooring.  I used the multi surface let cleaner solution provided.  The floors look amazing.  The machine is very lightweight compared to the floor mate and regular carpet cleaning machines.  About same noise wise, but it wasn't awful sounding like the floor mate which has a higher pitcher noise i hate.  I did not feel overly hot, either, like when I vacuum.  The cleaning solution is not over powering smell wise.  A plus for me.I ran out of solution before getting the throw rugs.  I did a quick vacuum on them and they are noticeably cleaner.The part I was dreading was the clean-up after use.  It actually was very easy.  The parts come apart easily and, more importantly, go back together easily.  It took no time to clean it up.  I love having two of the different brushes.  One can dry while I use the other.All in all, I'm very pleased.  It was hard spending the $$ on it but I'm glad I did.  Money well spent!",
J. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great tool but understand its limits,the United States,24-Nov-19,CrossWave Only,,"I got this as a gift and I think it does a good job. I find that on the textured tile in the kitchen it is less effective but still manages to do a decent job. I think it will be a great daily “maintenance” tool rather than a one time deep clean tool.  .On the hardwood floors it did a great job.My floors were quite dirty and I felt like after 10-15 minutes of use, I wanted to take it back to the base station and do a self-clean. I don’t think I would need to do it as often if I do it every few days. Likely won’t need to use the cleaning solution but once a week, just water the other days.I have a dog, lab, who sheds daily but mostly wanted this for mopping.  The cleaner did a good job with the dog hair and cleaning up the machine wasn’t too bad...a little extra work with taking out the roller, emptying the water bins, and general clean up if the machine.I’d recommend this!!",

I was able to clean up cat hair including grose cat hair balls, cat litter,  kibble, kitchen grease, dried tomato sauce, and out door dirt from foot traffic. It is easy to assemble, use and clean.  It would have been nice to have a corner attachment.  I am also not a fan of cleaning out bagless machines but I am not disappointed I bought this machine.  I bought mine direct from Bissel, no discount, and bought more cleaning solution, rollers, and filters up front so my total paid was close to 500, alot more than I would have liked to pay.  Just a note: I found the carpet roller stiff enough to clean the grout in my bathroom tile floors.",3

I have to stop and empty the chamber multiple times just cleaning my small living room and kitchen. Pet hair gets clogged very easily and I have to stop even more to keep unclogging it. When i do stop to unclog, or to empty the chamber, dirty water leaks all over the floor. I spent 45 MINUTES cleaning the machine after the first time i used it, to make sure it would work good the next time. The brush roll smelled like mildew, even after cleaning with bleach and letting air dry for a whole week. The next time i used it and I had to stop to clean the chamber in the middle of vacuuming my area rug, nasty black water leaked all over my rug and ruined it!

There's always a 2-3 inch strip around the baseboards that it doesn't clean so I have to go back with a  wet sponge to clean all the way to the wall. It barely pulls the water back out of my low pile rubber back rug.I was hoping this would be a huge time saver and that I could mostly retire my traditional vacuum and mop. However, for the time I have to spend cleaning the crosswave itself after use, it would've been easier to just use the traditional vacuum and mop.Furthermore, about 4 months after I paid it off (less than a year into use) part of the roller sponge door broke and it doesn't create a good seal anymore.

A. Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Throw Out the Old Mop & Bucket! This Machine Does it All!,the United States,18-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,,"A very good machine overall. Minimal assembly and worked tight out of the box without any learning curve to speak of. The best part is the bristle brush that handles all kinds of surfaces. It’s great at picking up lint and light debris off smooth hard surfaces, as well as rug piles and transition areas. The stiffer, longer bristles also do a good job of light scrubbing. I have not used it on a tile floor with deep-set or heavily soiled grout, but would not imagine the bristles could really be very effective on such a floor. The roller brush is easily removed for cleaning or replacement.Some of the product videos show cleaning situations that I think are a bit too much for it to handle. While it does vacuum and wet clean at the same time, results are maximized by doing some sweeping or cleaning with a more robust vacuum first, on heavily soiled areas.  The wet vac feature does a good job extracting the water and bringing it back to the collection tank where it can be easily emptied. There are a wide variety of cleaning solutions available making this a quite versatile machine. It would be nice if the detergent and collection tanks were a bit larger. It would disrupt the compact nature of the design, so it is a trade-off.I haven’t had any problems with the machine, but it simply doesn’t feel like the most robust thing out there. The price of the product seems a bit high for this reason, although the lightweight and compact design is nice. Definitely recommend as it is much more pleasant to use than a mop and bucket.",

He lets anyone he meets know that they should buy this product. It’s his latest obsession. I love this product because he gets so excited to clean our floors! The bissell leaves our floors shiny and clean. Perfect for a daily clean or a deep cleaning. We have used bona and swifter before but they have just caked on dirt on our floors and left the floors sticky. Not to mention, it takes twice as long to vacuum and mop. This is super useful because we both have back pain and the bissell doesn’t require us to exert our backs by scrubbing the floors like other products have. The bissell has great suction power and picks up the things on our floor with ease. We have had zero issues with streaking as other reviews have mentioned. Overall, I’d give this product a 9/10. One star off because I wish the collection bin was slightly bigger. Love, love, love this product!!!",

After vacuuming I'd often clean the floors with a wet towel but the rugs were a different story. I even rented one of those rug shampooers but it was too heavy and messy. When I saw this ad I thought, why not try it? It was extremely simple to put together and get ready for use but best of all it was so-o-o-o lightweight and maneuverable. Now if it just cleaned. I decided to just do a couple of rooms the first time but it was so easy and worked so well that I did the whole house! My favorite part was the rubber-type carpet in the kitchen that I've never figured out how to ""wash."" And, yes, when I cleaned it, there was MUD in the reservoir. That's good, right?! It was easy to clean up the machine and is small enough to slip into my closet beside my vacuum cleaner . . . which I may never use again. Oh, and after Easter and my grandkids were here, I ran it across the entry rug again to freshen it up. I don't have pets or kids so that could change my outlook.

We have had it a few weeks and my floors have NEVER been cleaner than they are now. They used to be yucked up with smashed bananas, fruit, mud etc and now they’re sparkling clean. I use it once a day, sometimes more if the smallest child throws his food everywhere. If you’re looking for a baby shower gift that’s a little out of the norm, buy this. It’s a necessity.

We purchased it and I vacuumed the light dirty floor(all tile). Noticed that when you use the spray cleaned if you have anything on the floor it would not actually bring it up took about 10 passes on a piece of dirt for it to mop it up.  I thought some of the stuff perhaps was really stuck on so i took my shoe and tried to see and it came right up. After about 6 months. this thing started falling apart. We are very good about cleaning it after each use all the parts including filters.. It started to just leak black nasty water on the grounds when using and cleaned even worse. Almost no suction anymore.  I called and they had me take it to a repair center that told me it will be a month before I possibly get it back and they are just going to send it to Bissell. Sir Shop and Vac.. So now I have to guy buy a new mop.(The reason we bought this was to now have that).  My Kirby vacuum is 10 years old works amazing. I may just order their tile cleaner.

SAS,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing this sucks is your time, effort, and money",the United States,5-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,,"We owned two Bissell vacuums before this one, and having been previously very pleased with the brand, we thought we'd shell out the money on the Crosswave Pet Pro. BIG mistake. In sum, it does not clean well, has an awful after smell, takes forever to clean, and Bissell's customer service is more useless than their over-priced time-sucking machine. Bottom line: save your time, effort, and money and spring for anything other than this product. Here's why  (and what we tried in vain to explain to the Bissell customer service representatives):1.The Crosswave Pet Pro fundamentally fails to do its core function: to clean. It can barely handle anything bigger than a granule of sand, and it does not adequately remove pet hair from carpets, which is why we bought it in the first place. Further, it leaves streaks on both hardwood floor and carpet, which  is the case even when switching out the brushes and using ones specialized for each surface. Every time we used the vacuum, we needed to go back and individually vacuum and mop separately, thereby defeating the purpose entirely.2. The after smell of the Crosswave Pet Pro is absolutely horrid, even though we cleaned it immediately after every use. Despite cleaning all the parts, it still omitted a smell that was a cross between mold and rancid water every time we came to use it. We even changed the filter twice to no avail.3. Cleaning the machine is a massive pain and takes forever, once again  nullifying the supposed “time saving” element of having a 2-in-1 vacuum. The hair gets stuck in the filter and where the brush attaches to the vacuum and in the tube around where the tank attaches to the vacuum. We spent more time cleaning the machine than the floor.4. When attempting to speak to a customer service representative - a supervisor in fact- to explain all of this,  we got a whole bunch of ""sorry, I'd love to help you, but. I can't."" Turns out customer service is as useless as the vacuum.",
E.Swope,3.0 out of 5 stars,Slim and light but no good for carpeting,the United States,25-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"is near as good as our Hoover anniversary (the best which we have had),  We also have a mop/ hard floor cleaner by Bissel which is very good.  In my opinion, while the Crosswave is a good idea, and a real space saver (vs owning 2 machines) it is not as good as either of the others is at the task it was designed for.  The Crossswave is slim and light but not as powerful as either the freestanding vacuum or mop.As a vacuum, the Crosswave has real limitations. It has 2 setings: hard floor and area rug.  It was not designed for and can not really do a reasonable job on carpeting.  For us, that means this is at best an accessory.  We still need a vacuum for the carpeting.  Aas a mop, it works pretty well as a multi-surface cleaner.  Unlike our older Bissel mop, it sprays a finer mist of solution, but the vacuum, not being as powerful, means it does not remove the water well.  Most of our house is teak parquet.  I did test it on part of the floor, but since it does not remove the water, would not be comfortable using it on fine wood (unless I was prepared to go back with a dry mop or cloths to remove the water which would otherwise damage the floor). The older mop does have a second chamber for the dirty water it vacuums up.  The Crosswave does not.As a vacuum it has real limitations since it can not be used on carpeting.  It  did fine on our tile floor in the bathrooms bith as a vacuum and a mop.  It was less good on the limestone in our living room, where it did not remove the water in the divots/ uneven areas characteristic of limestone.  What I like best about it is that it is small and light, and consequently easy to move from rom to room.  The head is also slimmer than our other vacuums (yes, we have a few) and so can get under the lip of our bookcases where pet hair doea tend to build up (since the other vacuums do not fit under there).  On the downside it does on have onboard tool storage, a retractable cord (the cord was constantly getting in the way, and is almost as heavy as the vacuum) or, most significantly, work on the carpeting, so we still needed to use another vacuum on half of the house.  For me that is enough to kil it in terms of utility as a multi-tool.  It could work well for someone with primarily hard floors and the occasional area rug.  It is anj improvement over a stick vacuum, and not a lot bigger or heavier.As a mop it worked remarkably well given that it does not pick up the dirty water.  I have to say that I really hate the cleaning fluid it comes with, and the Febreeze left our flooors sticky and smelling like a cheap motel or public washroom.  We did not have a problem with pet odor. (We keep our dog clean) but did have an odor problem after I mopped.  We had to air out the rooms for hours.  I would not use that cleaning solution again.  I also have to wonder how effective it is when the mop head is not brand new, since it is not removing dirty water.In sum, here are the pros and cons:Pros:Small and light, easy to move room to roomEasy and intuitive to operateSlim brush head gets under furniture and other places I can not easily reach with other vacuums or mopsFine mist means it can (maybe) be used safely on wood floorsCons:Not as powerful as other vacuums, or their older mopInsufficient for use on carpeting, literally requires another vacuum if you have carpetIt is a single tank, does not pick up dirty water.Cleaning fluid left our house sticky and stinking of something like air freshener (I found it nauseating and had to air the rooms in which I used it)No onboard tool storage or retractable cordAt the end of the day, I still think my old old Hoover anniversary vacuum is the best of dozens which have passed through our house, with our older Bissel pet vac coming in a close second,  Their older mop, while heavier and more of a challenge to use, has more suction and picks up the dirty water.  This has a finer mist but does not pick up water.I would recommend this for people who have primarily tile flooring with the occasional area rug.  Others will likely need a second or even third device to clean effectively.  Unless you like the smell of air freshener, really like it, do not use the cleaning solution.  For me that was the biggest liability, though the  easiest to remedy.",6

Trish,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I bought it!!,the United States,6-May-19,CrossWave Only,,"I’m really happy with this product. It does exactly what it says it does. I don’t understand some of these negative reviews. Either you’re not using the machine properly or your floors are just super dirty and that’s not the machine’s fault. It’s an every day/week vacuum cleaner for floors and area rugs, not a once a year cleaner. Also If you’re trying to do a shag carpet I doubt it’s going to do what you want.It cleaned really well for me and I loved that it’s basically a broom, mop and vacuum together in one. It sucked up all the pet hair and never left any dirty streaks for me. The dirty chamber fills up pretty quickly and then the suction stops but it’s an audible sound that lets you know you need to empty it before continuing so it wasn’t bad.And it’s super easy to clean. There’s no super complicated filter. You just take out the chamber and take out the filter and wash everything off. The brush is also easy to clean. Cleaning takes basically 10 mins.The only complaint I have (and this is me just being SUPER picky - it’s not even a real criticism) is the cord gets in my way a little when I’m cleaning. But like I said it’s not a huge deal. It doesn’t keep it out of the 5-star category for me.It does a great job on my area rugs without leaving a really wet feel to it. It’s just damp and dries quickly. And I like the scent of the cleaner. It’s just a nice fresh scent without being too overpowering.Def recommend if you’re looking for an easy cleaning routine.",One

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too time consuming,the United States,2-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,,"I bought this vac mop after it came highly recommended by my mom. I have an 85 lb German Shepherd (GSD) and I used this device on a tile floor with grout. I'm not sure if the grout had anything to do with it but the hair wouldn't get sucked up easily. The hair from the dog didn't all go through into the canister but instead got clogged under the filter. Some of the dirt did fly out of the sides and the air from the vacuum would push the hair away from the device causing me to go over the floor several times to pick up the dog hair/dirt. There's no hose attachment to get those harder to reach areas under the couch or coffee tables. I then switched to using the mop. It did the job however I had to fill the canister twice to cover the floor, which was around 800 sq. ft. Once you start using the mop, the wheels won't turn on the floor... You'll feel it glide around instead. It took me roughly 70 mins to vacuum and wash the floor. This device is too time consuming and very needy since it has to be cleaned after use.",

I told him to pitch the Shark Steam cleaner as it had quit steaming and really didn't do a great job in the first place, but he tossed my old bissell.  So, feeling quite justified, I went out and purchased the crosswave pet and I love it!  It was easy peasy to assemble and I love that it has a tray that you can clean your mop head.  My only complaint is that the Bissell cleaner that came with it left my floors super streaky, but I refilled the cleaner bottle with water and just a touch of Murphy's Oil Soap and my new wood floors look amazing!  It is super easy to use, super easy to clean both the dirty water tank and the roller and it will get right up to the baseboards if you are facing them as well as fit under the kitchen cabinets!

Only had it for a couple of weeks now but it has been fantastic thus far. We have bamboo floors and four different area rugs, one of which is long shag that our old vacuum couldn’t clean well at all and the CrossWave just powers right through all of them.Yes, it’s kind of a pain to clean when you’re finished, but it still cuts cleaning time in half. Love that it has the clean and dirty water in separate tanks. I’ve only used it with the included multi-floor solution thus far, but I’m sure using any all purpose cleaner would be fine.",2
Sam and Ashley Adams,2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves water/streaks,the United States,27-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,,"It vacuums hard floors greatly, but leaves a lot of water on the hard floors as well as in its brush rolls.  Even with slowing down.  I don't feel like they scrub as great as I'd expected, either.  It seems you go through the clean water tank 4 times faster than the dirty tank fills up.  Wasn't worth the amount of money I spent.",One
tami troutman,2.0 out of 5 stars,Over priced for the durability/value received,the United States,3-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,,"I liked it when it worked. Was extremely excited I got exactly what I wanted for mother's day, but now it is broke before Christmas. Dumps water because the cap doesn't seal on the tank. It's available as a replacement part, but it should be more durable. It also doesn't suck up all the water. I am hoping it's because the cap was bad, but I'm afraid the suction has actually broke as well. For the price I would not buy it again or recommend to others. If it were cheaper id consider it a yearly disposable and probably be happy with the results and saved time, however not at the current price point it would need to be about half the cost for me.",
Stephannie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great floor cleaner,the United States,23-Mar-20,CrossWave Only,,I have loved this floor vacuum/mop since purchasing it.  I do have two notes in regards to it:1.) I would recommend taking it apart each time it's used (dirty water reservoir parts and the roller) and soaking the parts in a sink of hot bleach water.  I've noticed if it's left between cleanings that it begins to smell.  Get an extra roller and change it out each time and let the used one dry out.2.) The roller cover is VERY difficult to remove.  I have arthritis in my wrists which makes it more difficult than usual.  It would be great if it snapped off with a button rather than having to be pulled off.  I ask my husband to get it off and he's commented that it's difficult.,
M. Burkett,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t suck up water from floor,the United States,10-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,,"It seemed to work the first time great then after that it’s just a Mess.  I have 3 cats and a cattle dog which produce a lot of hair.  I have dark laminate floors so it’s easy to see dirt especially when the sun hits it just right.  This machine DOES NOT suck up the water off the floor, the brush just spreads it around and this is very little water in the tank.  When the water dries, I have dull streaking everywhere.  It does great for picking up dry hair and litter so I just use it for that.  I am disappointed however than I can’t use it to wash my floors. I have taken it apart and cleaned every section of it I could but it still does a terrible job getting the water off the floors.",
Daniel Oliver,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so great,the United States,19-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,,"After 3 months, our original wouldn't suck up anymore water. The hose somehow got a giant slit in it. We got sent a replacement. Used that one twice and it wouldn't suck up anymore. Tried contacting Bissell numerous times and got nowhere. Threw it out to the curb and bought a Hoover Powerdash for hard floors. Yea we have to vacuum and mop again but the hoover clean the floors 10x better than the crosswave ever will. Bissell has turned into a cheaply made money grab. Like your favorite fresh restaurant switching to frozen and canned goods and hiring crack head Tammy to be your waitress who offers to blow you out back for an extra $10. Hey, if that's what you're into, then you go for it. For an extra 2 bucks, I hear she'll take out her teeth ;-). Anyways, Bissell is the new Tammy.",One
Mikey N,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It does what it says it will do ""with the greatest of ease""!!!",the United States,2-Oct-19,CrossWave Only,,"I used my Cross Wave today for the first time. I used it in my laundry/mud room. This room has a doggy door, so my two dogs track mud inside. Both of my dogs have medium long hair and shed continuously. The Bissell had no problem cleaning the "" white"" tile floor and the excessive dog hair. I particularly like the Bissell has the option to vacuum up the excess water off the tile floor. I also tried it on a carpet runner I have at my front door, I did have to hang the rug outside to dry. I am very pleased with the results of both. The Multi-surface cleaning solution leaves a pleasant smell. It was easy to clean the dirty water container during use and to clean the machine afterwards.  Using the rinse and store tray makes clean up of the Bissell quick and easy. The storage tray insures the machines and rollers dry without damaging the surface of the storage area.  :-}",One

I've had it a year now and the moment a droplet of water goes last the brush it mixes with dirt in the ball forming a glue like substance. Then the hair gets stuck in the ball & now there is no suction. Beyond frustrating (not to mention disappointing, especially with the price tag) that about once a month, if not more often, I have take apart the vacuum or stick my finger/tools into the vacuum and clean it out. I rarely use this to mop, it is really from vacuuming over wet paw prints. Not worth the frustration and money IMO!",
Elissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much better than regular mopping,the United States,24-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,,"I love this vac mop so much.  Wish I would have gotten it a year ago when we put our new flooring in.  Because we have red clay dirt/dust where we live, I used to do the 2 bucket method and would have to change  the water at least once for each room. Ugh I hated mopping.  It was a sweaty2 hour workout.With the crosswave I like to go over the floor a few times in different directions to get it really clean.  On my last 2 passes over the floor I make sure to NOT press the water button & suck up any extra wetness left on the the floor.  No streaking!  Mopping is much more enjoyable now.Common sense tip: don't try to mop-vac up an entire  raw egg or a spoonful of peanut butter or any other gooey sticky mess  - use some common sense and wipe most of it up with a paper towel or rag first, like you would with a regular mop.",
T H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love hate relationship but I did discover a trick to help with the cleaning of the machine.,the United States,13-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,"Love hate relationship but the secret to cleaning the roller brush, the tunnel/hose where everything gets sucked in, and the cover that gets super dirty after cleaning carpets..... spray or dump a small cup of water/cleaning solution on hard floor surface and let the crosswave suck all the liquid up and let it run for few minutes. That usually does the trick for unclogging the machine and getting debris out of brush and off the window cover. Cleaning out the dirty water and debris is gross. I started using my dogs pee pads to dump the dirt and grime and then throw away the pad. Then rinse the container and filter in soapy water.",One
Bailey Bronson,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wouldn’t recommend spending the money!,the United States,12-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,,"My boyfriend just spent over $300 on this vacuum with high hopes that it would work great on our new floors.. to say the least, I’m HIGHLY disappointed. Please for your wallets sake, do not waste your money on this vacuum. I’ve literally used it THREE times and the suction is so minimal I almost feel like there must be a defect in this vacuum. I blatantly will a little dirt on our hard floors to see if it sucks anything up, nope. It runs it over time and time again before it even sucks part of it up. I have two short-haired dogs who shed minimally and I still find hair everywhere. I tried the solution on our area rug too... just don’t LOL. This thing is not worth the money. If you need clarification, I’d be happy to send you the mess it leaves all over our floors after I shut it off. I clean and empty this thing after E V E R Y use and it is still junk. SO disappointed - I figured spending hundreds of dollars would almost guarantee a worthy vacuum, trust me when I say don’t do it.",
Shelby,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute Waste of $,the United States,12-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,,"I bought this because I have 2 long haired pets (a long haired cat and a husky). I was so excited to use this on my 2 area rugs (3x5 and 4x6). Within 5 minutes I realized it wasn't sucking hardly anything up, rather just pushing hair around. And pretty much was just making my rugs wet. You're supposed to be able to go back over the rug and dry vacuum to suck the dirty solution out... doesn't really do that either lol. so now I have a soaking wet rug with clumps of pet hair all over it 😐",
M. R. Muller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, awesome product!",the United States,16-Oct-19,CrossWave Only,,"This is our second crosswave and what a great, great product it is! It takes a bit to understand how to take care of it, but so very worthwhile. For instance, we both didn’t tighten down the cap on the detergent reservoir properly and ending up soaking the floor, but if that cap is on tight it never causes an issue. So easy to clean up too. What I love is that it not only does a great job of picking up the fur from our year round shedding kitty, but you can tell it captures the oils and dander she leaves behind too. Thank you Bissell for creating such a wonderful product. I will always have a crosswave in my arsenal of cleaning tools. We have low pile carpet in half of our house and it’s working great on that as well. Thanks again!",One
Meredith Kohls,1.0 out of 5 stars,BUYER BEWARE!! AWFUL PURCHASE!! SAVE YOURSELF THE $$$ AND READ THIS.,the United States,22-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,,"Overall - I am so disappointed and angry at this purchase!! I would sell it but it SMELLS.I am aggravated also, that they advertise this as a on-in-all tool for moms and pet owners. IT IS NOT THAT! The streaking on wood floors, uneven dispense of fluids, the smell, the lack of suction, the lack of mobility.. Do NOT buy this vacuum. I was on the fence and regret everything.This is the MOST disappointing product I have bought in my adult life. I am 26 - never leave reviews. I cant begin to tell you how terribly wasted my money was on this vacuum - For three reasons:- False advertising: This is supposed to be a mop/vacuum all in one but its NOT! The vacuum (while its suction is OK) can NOT get into the hard to reach areas. My vacuum couldnt even pick up confetti or leaves. The Mop - leaves streaks, does not deep clean and STINKS!!! I have ONE small dog, I clean the vacuum after every use - IT SMELLS TERRIBLE. Again - DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOURE LOOKING FOR AN EASY TO USE VACUUME- lack of quality:As I stated before, the vacuum barely picks up larger items, my $15 amazon vacuum gets the hard to reach places and larger items better than this piece of JUNK. Not only that, the cleaning process is tedious and NOT easy.  and even if you DO clean it after every use - it REAKS. I am not a smelly person - I live in a 500 sqft apartment - the crosswave is terrible for apartments bc you have little crevices and hard to reach areas. Also, my Swiffer wetjet works better than the mop on this. I am so upset I didnt just spend the extra $$ and get a freakin dyson.- maneuverability:Again, hard to reach places!! This vacuum is NOT for you if you have those! Its bulky, doesn't move smoothly and cant deep clean where you need it.Save yourself the time and money - buy a wet jet, a dyson or shark - and never purchase this POS.",
Jessie S Leichner,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money!,the United States,27-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,,This machine leaves streaks when on lenolium and when it washes carpet. The rollar is like ten dollars a shot . I spent 300.00 and used it a few times and got frustrated at the fact my floors I ended up hand scrubbing after I would try using the cross wave . And the money for new dollars is costly. I literally gave this machine away for free !,4
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,#GameChanger #MomWin #BestPurchaseEver,the United States,20-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,,"I dont usually write reviews because it takes time and I usually forget. But i am actually taking the time to review this pet pro because it has seriously changed my life. No longer shall I spend my days hunched over, slaving away to clean the floors. This machine is the ultimate weapon in the battle against filth.  I have 3 little mess making kids, 1 really cool cat, 3 dogs (who should have no hair from the amount they shed) and 1 fiancee who refuses to wipe mud off his shoes. My whole house is hardwood and laminate floors and we have a few large area rugs. Trying to keep the floors hair and mess free was a never ending chore. I was always sweeping and mopping. I even went as far as to buy a $300 robot vacuum, which I really dont need anymore. If I had to choose between this pet pro all in one or the robot vacuum I would, without a doubt, pick this machine. I have named her Nancy and she is my best friend! It doesnt replace a carpet shampooer but it does great on spills and even old coffee stains! My daughter (18mo) loves to pack her plate or bowl around while she eats and it always ends in a spill. This morning I had soggy cap'crunch and this afternoon it was ramen noodles on the rug. I didnt have to get on my knees and expertly pick up each soggy piece while trying to keep from squishing them into the carpet, all while trying to keep her from eating them off the floor. I just grabbed Nancy and BOOM the mess was gone. It actually picked it all up too, rather than just push it into the rug. The only reason I gave this 4 stars in one category is because there is a strainer inside the collection bin that is meant to strain out the solid pieces and dog hair you've sucked up. It works pretty good but doesnt get everything. It was a simple fix though! I just bought a wire mesh sink strainer and it picks up anything the other strainer misses. Seriously, if your even considering this product just go for it! Trust me on this one. Your welcome!!",2
j,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very much worth the purchase.,the United States,30-Mar-21,CrossWave Only,,"I am glad I purchased the Crosswave.  I have two in/out shedding dogs , three in/out cats, and lots of grandkids & their friends in and out all day long. We removed all carpet and have no rugs.  I usually run the iroomba first to collect as much dirt and hair as it can. Then I mop.  Having vinyl plank floors with grooves is not the easiest to clean.  I used to use the bissell cleaning liquids, but they just left streaks. Now i use water and vinegar. Took me several repeated moppings to get all the bissell product up. Now i just know that the floor will never shine like other types of flooring; and i have to be content that overall they look pretty good. Upstairs is a smooth vinyl plank that looks like laminate. It tends to leave streaks, so i might try a different roller.  I don’t regret the Crosswave at all! So much easier on my back than any other mop i have tried!",
Kurt Weber,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hardwood floor and pet hair vacuum/mop cleaner ever!,the United States,13-Aug-18,CrossWave Only,,"As of yet, this is the best hardwood cleaning machine I have ever used. Hand mops, steamers...all leave streaks and require constant changing of pads and rinsing of the mop to even get them to streak slightly less. The Crosswave allows you to do the entire floor with maybe one emptying of the waste bucket. Cleaning is a breeze and the very cool brush cleaning method showed on the video not only cleans the bush of hair and dirt but spin it to a slightly dampened state.On carpets it performs well, although vacuuming and cleaning with my carpet cleaner works better, albeit it takes three times the work. For everyday cleaning the Crosswave is my go-to gadget.What others gadgets fail at is the cleaning, especially with hairy pets. I spend nearly equal time cleaning them as cleaning the floor.  The waste bucket and roller are an amazing easy clean even with a very hairy floor.The price is a bit steep but this is a specialized gadget that is well thought out.  If you have very messy pets you will appreciate the light weight and quick clean up this provides. If you use the hardwood floor setting this gadget slightly wets the floor and uses the detergent economically.",2

Artback,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very Good, Yet Proper Machine Clean-Up Afterwards Takes Time",the United States,6-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,,"This is a great machine for cleaning wood floors and/or area rugs after our aging medium sized dog has an accident.  As this dog ages, however, frequency of use of this machine is increasing.  Every use of this machine winds up being up to a 45 minute adventure, not because of the time for cleaning the floors, but for the time it takes to properly disassemble, rinse, wash and thoroughly clean the components.  Disassembled dry time is supposed to be 24 hours, yet our frequency of use is more often lately.  For frequent users, I recommend buying at least one additional brush roller and one extra filter so they can be rotated between uses for proper drying of the other set.  In addition, there is a rubber gasket used where the wastewater tank joins the vacuum.  Don't lose that one as Bissell is currently out of stock (on back-order) and you won't have use of the machine until they're back from their supplier.",

It would take me hours to clean on my hands and knees scrubbing.  then about 15 years in we decide to ge a puppy, well it was worse and i kept it clean but it was back breaking.THEN I SAW THIS COMMERCIAL AND BOUGHT IT.

I've suffered through the ""hard way"" of cleaning hard floors for years -- spray floor cleaner + flat mop (such hard physical work when you have acres of hard flooring, but would be just fine if I just had one or two rooms of hard floors -- but if you don't change the pad very frequently, you're just spreading dirt around) and then tried the steam mop (works fairly well and isn't such hard physical work, but you still have to change that pad very frequently or again, you're just spreading dirt around). I found the Crosswave much, much more effective and the final outcome MUCH better. I can't believe how much dirt comes off those floors. Wow. My floors look GREAT.

Needless to say, I have to clean my floors daily, sometimes twice a day and am SOOOOOO very happy I bought this. I’ve bought several different vacuums and floor cleaners, there’s nothing out there like the crosswave.. Nothing is able to vacuum and clean the floor at the same time and I’ve tried everything on the market. I’ve had multiple shark vacuums, a Kirby, a dyson, oreck, etc... you name it, I’ve owned it. I’ve had the crosswave for 6 months now and like I said use it everyday for large areas, both hard floors and carpet and I’m always amazed at how well it works. I also love the fact that I can clean ALL the parts and with such ease!

Nathaniel W. Martin,1.0 out of 5 stars,I can't comprehend how anyone would ever 5 star this garbage,the United States,23-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,,Easily the worst purchase I've ever made.  It is only good as a hard wood vacuum and even then a broom will suffice.  I bought this because I have laminate floors which aren't supposed to get really wet but the mop portion of this barely gets the dust off the ground.  The worst part by far is the bottom tray that holds the bristles in.  It's cemented on after each use and requires at least 50lbs of force to pull off (measured with a hook) and is a must because it gets clogged with hair and dust immediately.  The hole gets clogged often where the water is supposed to be vacuumed into the garbage reservoir which stops all functioning until it is cleaned by a hose outside where mud from the floors gets to run all over the vacuum and your hands.  Do not consider buying this at all please do yourself a favor.,

Josie O,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tired of sweeping and mopping?,the United States,24-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,,"Then this is for you!! I just bought it from Walmart last night (it was a few bucks cheaper and I like instant gratification lol). I assembled it today in less than 5 minutes. This included tearing open the box, making sure everything was there, putting it together and taking box out to the trash. I had it set up in another 5 minutes during my breaks in cooking dinner for my family.Then I turned it on!Oh. MY. Gawd! It's like mommy heaven... or cleaner heaven.... or just plain heaven. No sweeping up to empty in the trash. Gone are my days of hauling around a hardfloor vacuum, a mop, and yes, even a Swiffer to get to those hard to reach places. And buh-bye to begging someone to help me. I plugged it in and off I went, like Dorothy on her yellow brick road, except mine were clean (squeaky clean) tile that takes a wire brush to get that way.So if I haven't sold you on ease, let me tell you about cleaning.... its a no brainer. It has a filter. it helps catch hair, fur, and larger debris. A quick swipe with the inside of a plastic bag and presto! All clean!! Then a quick rinse of the reservoir and dirty water tank... and finally, the best part of cleaning it thus far has been the brush cleaner. This part involves a little maneuvering but nothing extraordinary. You put it on the base, fill the base with water. and vacuum it up! The rollers clean themselves and all you have to do, instead of touching dirty rollers, is put the clean ones to dry in its respective part on the base.Now, I'm learning t bgg at it takes a little extra time to do the extra cleaning of the machine.... but honestly, with all the time I'm saving... what's a few extra minutes?It's worth it for my family and finally being able to walk barefoot in my home. This mommy is 100% pleased. And note:: I almost never comment and I felt the need to make this comment. DON'T PASS THIS UP!

Paula,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro does what it says it does.,the United States,16-Sep-18,CrossWave Only,,"I purchased my Pet Pro from the Bissell website, but reviews here on Amazon are what made me decide to buy it, so I thought I would review it here. I am a 56 year old woman, with 3 cats. I find mopping with a mop and bucket to be tedious, and it makes my back ache. I've been looking for a product that would clean my floors without all the work of mopping.The Pet Pro cleans very well.  It works by dispensing cleaning solution through a spinning roller. The roller does the cleaning function. The vacuum then sucks up the dirty water and puts it in a separate, dirty water, tank. This solves the problem that I always disliked about mopping: no more pushing dirt around on the floor with a mop that still has dirty water on it. The vacuum is very strong, and has no problem sucking up dirt, water, and whatever else gets in its way (I accidently bumped into the cat food bowl while cleaning, and it sucked up the spilled dry cat food, lickety split). The Pet Pro has a different spinning rod for every type of floor: a super soft brush for wood, a stiff brush for area rugs, and a hybrid soft/stiff roller for tile. The rods are super easy to change in and out, as are the clean and dirty water tanks. This unit actually cleaned my grout. I am very impressed. Also, I thought my floors were cleaner than they actually were. The dirty water I found in the tank was a little alarming. Yuck.The only thing I don't like about the product is the smell of the wood floor cleaner. I wish it smelled more lemony. Other than that, I really love my Pet Pro, and would highly recommend it.",
Summer Smith,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,the United States,15-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,I enjoy Bissell products but this does not deserve all of the hype it gets. Prepare to have to sweep and especially mop after using it. The suction is poor and basically pushes around dirty water. I live in a small home with one dog who sheds minimally and it is still not equipped to do the job. I also put the dirty water tank in the dishwasher as I wasn't able to clean the crevasses and now the tank isn't usable and needs to be replaced. Any product that gets that dirty should have dirty water tanks that are dishwasher safe. I would consider this as a deep cleaner if there was actual suction power and was easily maneuverable. Prepare to clean around all baseboards and corners as this is unable the reach them. This product is a 1/10.,

I have always hated to do floors and the Crosswave makes it simple.  I was skeptical at first that one machine could vacuum and clean at the same time.  It does a good job and I am very happy with it.  What really makes me smile is that it is easy to clean too.  At first I thought it would be tough to clean but after doing it a few times, I think it is very easy.  I actually get a kick out the automatic cleaning cycle.  It is easy to take apart and easy to put back together too.  Hope this lasts a very long time because I really like it.",
Curious One,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Concept...,the United States,25-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,,"The idea of combining vacuuming with deep cleaning appealed.  After several months of use, the vacuum suction lessened and the brushes required constant un-clogging of pet hair.  At this point, I basically use it for deep cleaning only.  I liked how clean water and dirty water containers were separate.  I use this on rugs only and it will take at least 24 hours to dry.  This Bissell uses a lot of water when it cleans.  They include a sample cleaning product that worked well.  They include a tray to clean the brushes but I stopped using it because it took too long and who has the room to store a bulky vacuum accessory?  My conclusion is that the execution needs a little more work.",

I used to have to sweep/vaccum first, then fill up the mop bucket, get to work and then use a fan to dry.The crosswave has far exceeded my expectations. It requires little detergent and you can even make your own home alternatives. Assembly consists of about five pieces, all of of which are very easy to put together. Cleaning the entire machine takes me less than five minutes and I only do a full clean every three uses or so. And the results speak for themselves!! It vaccums all the debree and leaves your floors squeaky clean. You can even use this on small rugs. And what's better, I got a remanufactured one from Ollie's for $115 bucks, and I guarantee it works as good as the new ones. Best buy I've made so far this year.Two months later and I use it almost every day. This thing is a breeze. No mess, I can't recommend it enough and I have 6 cats and a dog.

Our first floor is entirely darker laminate ""wood"" flooring, and with 5 pets (one of which is a high-shedding dog), it's impossible to make look clean - or so I thought.I've spent the last 2 years cursing these floors... they never look clean even after hours of work to vacuum, dust mop twice, and then mop them. They were always dull, streaky, dirty looking.This product easily cut out about 70% of the work that I was doing... and my floors actually look clean (unfortunately, they are so clean now that you can see all of the scratches from our energetic, 60 pound dog - really the only drawback I've found! haha).I had to dump the canister about halfway through, but I'm totally okay with that. It's worth the 2 minutes I spent to do that.",One
Scott,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't quite work right,the United States,19-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"I wanted to try and see if a smaller size wet/dry would be easier than one of those larger bissell ones. Well for the most part it is easier, lighter for sure. The bristle head pivots a little and that helps move it around. The cord is nice and long which helps you not have to keep changing plugs a lot. When you first open the box all you really have to do is put the handle on so its pretty much ready to go out of the box.The soap cleaning solution container is great....finally one that doesn't leak. The free solution they give you smells great. I used hot water hoping that it would help in making the cleaning better....well......this is where the problem is....i went over spots that i could have cleaned easily with my large bissell cleaner but this smaller one didn't really do a good job. I had to keep going over the same area to get it to start to look like it was doing anything. And then It made any dirt and stains look darker.I also noticed that the soap container was just about empty and there was barely and i mean barely any dirty water in the waste container. The vacuum was sucking up but just not enough i guess.I figured overnight after it dried id see if it helped but it really didn't do that great of a job cleaning the spots/high traffic areas. I also tried the hard floor button and i found the same problem. i had to go over spots multiple times (and i mean like 10) for it to work good. Mind you, my floors get done every 2 weeks but with the nasty weather we've had lately, they really needed a scrubbing.Don't know why it didn't work as i hoped. i put plenty of solution in using the guides. I'm going to try again and hope for better results.",5
carrie wilson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Burns up and starts smoking almost immediately,the United States,2-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,,I  have been struggling with this since mothers day. After only about a month if i did too much area at a time it would start smoking.. wasn't too big of a deal at first i would just take a break between upstairs and downstairs. Ive tried everything I can to work around it since I spent so much money on it. I don't run it with less then half of the solution bottle full and only for shorter and shorter bursts but now it is completely useless. I had to put it outside after using for less than 5 min because i thought it might burst into flames.. I never write reviews and just work around issues but this is ridiculous. I should have written this sooner. Unless you have a studio apartment I would NOT buy this!!!! I got this as a mothers day present for my mom and myself and its been a total waste!!!!,
Ogr8ys1,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good News / Bad News,the United States,18-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,The good news is I got to throw away my bulky 15 yo shampooer as this lightweight entry cleaned the rugs just a step below outstanding.  The bad news is because it is lightweight so if you have pets such as I you will still need your heavy duty vacuum.  I also think for larger houses this will not replace your original vacuum as it fills to capacity rather quickly..  Overall an excellent product with those caveats.,4
Kim M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,So glad I bought this!!,the United States,23-Apr-19,CrossWave Only,,"This machine has made my life so much easier!  I knew I had to get one after my neighbor raved about hers and I'm so glad I did.  I have a great deal of tile in my home and there always seems to be dog hair, pieces of kibble, dirt, accidents, and slobber messes that pop up.  Cleaning the floor was practically a project - vacuuming, swiffering, mopping.....this machine takes care of the mess in one step.  I only had to use a small bit of solution for the kitchen, dining, hallway, and front room, and only at the end did I run out of liquid in the dispenser.  This machine is worth every penny.  Please note that you do have to use the Bissell solution with the Crosswave Pet Pro, but a little goes a long way.",
Connie Bell,1.0 out of 5 stars,What a disappointment!!! Stay away from this mess!!!,the United States,13-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,,"I haven’t purchased this thing yet and have now decided not to based on the reviews I’ve read here and the fact that a family member bought this thing and I went over to try it out as I couldn’t believe it was as horrible as she said. She was not exaggerating. It’s hard to clean, leaves dirty water everywhere, and the suction is abysmal. Thank goodness I dodged this bullet. My suggestion is to STAY AWAY and don’t waste your money.",
Nicole Littletaylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Cleaning Product I Have Ever Purchased,the United States,28-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,,"I have never purchased a cleaning product that I have been more pleased with. I have stained concrete floors, 3 kids, and 3 dogs. Keeping floors clean has always required constant mopping and vacuuming. I use this cleaner mainly just for mopping, as I run our robot floor vaccum daily. To keep up with pet hair.Things I loved:1. Because it is also a vaccuum,  it still sucks up the missed spot of hair/dirt while you're mopping. Previously, I would vaccuum the house and mid mopping, see a clump of hair that was missed and have to pick it up by hand.2. You are cleaning with CLEAN water only. Versus the mop/mop bucket where the water is only clean when you start.3. The floors dry ridiculously quick, as this machine is sucking up water after it has laid it down. This allows pets/kids allowed on the clean floors much quicker than when I used a traditional mop.So far, I don't hate anything about it, which is also a plus!",One
Kevin le,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not perfect but it works,the United States,14-Jul-21,CrossWave Only,,I’ve had this for almost a year. This is a good product - I have read many other reviews about it - people want this to be a miracle machine - yes it does smear and you do see left over dirt but if you look at the water tank after it sucked full you will see that it picked up a lot of grime off ur floor. The key for me is to do a second run with my other bissell spin wave to pick up the residue - also must was it with a hose after you use it to keep it clean.,2
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,I wouldn’t give this to my worst enemy,the United States,21-Aug-21,CrossWave Only,,"I won this in a raffle and honestly that’s the only reason I still have it. If I bought it I would sent it back for my money back. But week after week I attempt to use the floor washing feature (the vacuum is fine) but it leaves a dirty water puddle every time! It also leaves dirty streaks on the floor which I then have to clean with my swiffer. I have tried EVERYTHING! I have frequently changed the filter….. frequently changed the roller to anoint where I’m buying new ones constantly. I have cleaned the thing top to bottom. I cleaned the bottom of it, the inside, and all the parts. Well today was the last straw. I cleaned the whole thing, replaced the filter, and replaced the roller and it still did it. So I have to reclean the floors when I’m done and with all the time to clean the vacuum itself. It’s just not worth it. I’ve never hated anything I’ve had more in my life.",
Tsukiakari,1.0 out of 5 stars,Found elsewhere at a significant discount; wasn't even worth it at that price,the United States,3-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,,"I was excited to finally scrub my floors. I found this at a great price on sale elsewhere so I picked it up after seeing how highly rated it was. Boy has it been a disappointment. I was hoping to tackle some grimy spots but it really doesn't clean my floors any better than the ol' Swiffer with wet pads and it left the small rug I cleaned feeling crunchy like a stale towel. Even at a big discount, this wasn't nearly worth the price--it's going back. There's got to be something better out there.",
KWT,5.0 out of 5 stars,You need this!,the United States,3-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,Friends said I couldn’t live without it. When it went on sale I took the plunge. My first cleaning was from construction so dry wall dust everywhere! On NEW vinyl plank flooring. I was nervous. It did GREAT!! I failed to take before and after pics.Some areas did take more than one swipe but it was DIRTY!My only complaint is that it doesn’t get as close to the wall as I would like. I used my swifter to get in the crevices and against the baseboards.,

It’s easy to use. The maneuvers around table legs and cabinets w/o loosing power and cleaning ability. It vacuums and cleans better than I thought possible. I would rate it higher than a 5 if I could. It’s easy to use, cleans very good and most of all it’s easy to clean up and store away until next use. I’m a very happy and excited costumer.",
Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must if you have pets,the United States,23-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,,This product is so amazing. We have hardwood floors and sweeping every day and mopping all the time was just not ideal. We purchased a small vacuum for hardwood floors to help with the dog hair but it just wasn’t enough. The cross wave has a powerful vacuum that picked up al the dog hair. I used it on our mats we have in front of the doors too and it made them look brand new. I finished the entire downstairs with one water tank and didn’t have to refill. It also only took me about 20 minutes versus the 1.5 hours it used to take. The floor also felt so clean after. Love this!!,One
David Armstrong,5.0 out of 5 stars,A gift from the cleaning gods,the United States,28-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,,I absolutely love this machine. I had a Hoover floormate and not even one full month it was already malfunctioning. This crosswave is far superior and much quicker too. The cleanup of this machine is also quicker. Get the area rug brush for rugs as I found the multi surface pet brush made my rugs look ugly plus it works better for stains. I also got the wood floor brush since majority of my home is wood floors. When going over stains take your time on those parts and it will come out.,
Route66Guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome machine,the United States,23-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,,"OMG, our new Bissell Crosswave is awesome. Mop and sweep all at once with fantastic cleaning power. Great for someone with chronic pain, disabled or back injuries as light weight and it does all the work. Wish I had found this years ago. It's great at handling the long hair from our pet. The suction power is incredible. During the self cleaning it did great cleaning itself up. No more wringing out a mop or doing twice the work vacuuming first then moping which my back couldn't handle. We got a better deal directly from Bissell. I highly recommend this product.",
Russell Fanelli,2.0 out of 5 stars,Defective machine that is more trouble than it is worth.,the United States,24-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"The advertisement on Amazon for the Bissell Wet/Dry Vacuum is attractive and persuasive.  I ordered it.  When it arrived we took it out of the box and quickly set it up.  The directions for use are excellent.  Now we had the machine ready to go in our kitchen and we prepared to wash the kitchen floor with the vaccuum.A bottle comes with the machine that we filled with warm water and cleaning solution as per the directions we were given.  We placed the bottle where it belonged on the vacuum and heard the bottle click in as directed.  Unfortunately, water immediately started flowing out of the bottom of the vacuum.  We quickly took the bottle off, checked it carefully, and put it back on the machine, hearing it click in as directed.  Again, cleaning solution started coming out the bottom of the vacuum.  Our machine is defective.That said, we did have plenty of water on the kitchen floor so we did use the machine to clean the floor and discovered that it did not do a good job getting up soiled areas of the floor; these we had to clean by hand.  I thought, all right, the vacuum is also designed to work on carpets; perhaps I will have good success on another surface where water is not needed.  Sadly, the Bissell is very difficult to push back and forth over a carpet surface, much more difficult than our regular vacuum cleaner.Now that we had tested the machine on hard floors and carpets, we needed to clean it and we discovered that cleaning the Bissell was more trouble than it was worth even if it worked reasonably well, which it did not.Bottom line.  We received a defective machine that leaked water and did not clean well even when used as a dry vacuum.",9

It’s super messy, muddy, and hard to clean after you use it. If you also have a large house it’ll only work halfway through before you have to clean it out. Also must wash the roller each use otherwise next time you use it it’ll smell like rotting garbage. I hate this and it was a HUGE waste of money for what it’s worth.

I owned a number of bissell sweepers over the years, still no SUCKSION POWER. Never never dump your dirty water from the floor in to your kitchen sink, very very unsanitary, I know bissell's commercial shows that and could not believe my eyes, I worked in a hospital for 20 yrs., with the CDC coming in every 8 to 9 months, this can be emptied in toilet, shower or tub drain,  but never in a place where you prepare food.",
Eileen,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not that good,the United States,19-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,,"I had high expectations for the price. It is okay for quick clean up but not what it claims. I does not have the suction it should, can't get close to the wall, it leaves a good inch you have to clean by hand, and does not put out the amount of water necessary to clean well. It sprays so little water that you don't get a good rinse. You have to go over and over. The filter is not very good, clumps of hair in the bin, in the water, ,in the area all around the floor roller, in the filter that is supposed to keep the hair out. For the price I do not recommend. If all you want is a quick fix for spot cleaning, not bad. I have had to go back with a mop and for carpet pet messes.....I have to go back to my heavy Hoover carpet steamer to actually pull the water and mess out of the carpet. .",

Deb231,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pet Hair and Water Do Not Mix,the United States,2-May-19,CrossWave Only,,"I had extremely high hopes when purchasing this vacuum, unfortunately, it has been a waste of $$$.  We have two dogs with medium length hair and two cats.  The vacuum has good suction power and is effective on both hard floor surfaces and area rugs.  Under no circumstance, however, is the mopping feature effective. Water and hair = major clogging in the suction chamber.  Sadly, the suction tube  easily clogs with hair when using the mop, making it impossible to proceed without stopping after every room to take apart, clean, and reassemble.  I have even vacuumed the whole house first then gone back to use the mop feature separately, but again, even the smallest amount of hair clogs the tube.  Another major problem is once the suction tube is clogged, dirty water leaks back onto your floors and carpets.  The Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro All in One Wet Dry Vacuum and Mop has been one of my biggest purchase regrets.  I paid a lot of money to get to end up with just a vacuum.",

And why Bissel made it to where you can't remove the cloth pad and throw it in the washing machine, I will never understand.

I was hoping it would work better on grout, but didn't find it helpful there.  It seems to have problems with stuck on debris, and has problems with slightly larger pick-up.Maybe I was expecting too much for the big price.It cleans up like a smaller carpet cleaner, and takes a good while to dry.It's convenient, and I will keep using it.

It vacuums just fine...  when you o to wash your floor, it leaves nothing but dirty water tracks EVERYWHERE (and it STINKS) when you turn it on.  I wash it thoroughly after every use, and have even tried washing it in when going from one room to the other.  Nothing works.  I use it to vacuum up dog hair (my little 20$ vacuum does the same exact job) and IF I use that feature on the vacuum, I have to stiffer afterwards.

The vacuum does a good job of doing the sweeping and mopping at the same time. At the end of the day, I did not have buyer's remorse but I am also not sure if it will replace any of my current cleaning tools since it has drawbacks.Cons: My biggest issue is the lack of a detachable wand to get in tighter spaces and corners ( between toilet and tub etc). The vacuum leaves about an inch gap between from the edge of the wall where the brush doesn't reach so a wand would be helpful there too.",
Cheryl T.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't get this if you have hair, have kids that have hair, pets that have hair ...",the United States,23-Dec-19,CrossWave Only,,"You know what is worse than trying to cut hair off of a vacuum roll?  Trying to cut and untangle hair off of a WET vacuum roll.  You know what is worse than a clogged hose or nozzle?  Having to stick your fingers in the part that connects the brush roll to the dirty fill tank and pulling something out that looks like the hairballs our cat occasionally barfs up, but smells worse and is muddier.  Also not fun, the lovely wet dog smell that starts to happen about halfway through cleaning the house b/c ... we have a dog ... which is why we got the pet version in the 1st place.  Also, the strainer doesn't catch enough, so I end up rinsing mud out of the dirty water tank.  It's a PITA to have to clean it and dry it each time I use it, especially with as often as I clean my house.  I bought spare filters and  brush rolls to swap halfway through each cleaning to try to fix the wet dog smell issue - and so that I would always have some filters dry and ready if I had just cleaned and a kid or dog had an accident  - but it's just a big fat NOPE for my household.  It doesn't replace my vacuum b/c it doesn't have enough features (IE no hose and doesn't do well on big jobs)  It doesn't replace my steam mop (doesn't scrub well enough and has the tendency to leave dirt behind)  It's basically a super duper expensive cheap version of a wet dry vac that doesn't do either wet or dry particularly well.

Joe & Brenda,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THIS MACHINE,the United States,28-May-19,CrossWave Only,,"I purchased at BB&B because I had to have it that day...patience is not my thing.I have had Floormates for years and when my last one quit, I decided to try the Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro.  SO GLAD I DID.  I don't like vacuuming and mopping at the same time, at least I didn't.  This little machine is amazing.  I have only missed vacuuming and mopping my floors one day since I got this.  It cleans very nicely and dries quickly.  It doesn't edge all the greatest, but that's not much of an issue for me.  The best part, for me, is how easy it is to clean the machine afterwards.  I love how you can pour water in the base to clean the machine.  The sifter thingy is great.  Just rinse the filter, the floater, the tank, pop off and rinse the thingy that holds the brush roll in, and rinse the brush roll (which is already pretty much cleaned from rinsing in the base) and let everything dry.  I highly recommend purchasing extra filters and brush rolls.  Be careful not to let it lay or fall on the ground.  It soaks the filter and doesn't want to work with a soaking wet filter.",

Andersen,2.0 out of 5 stars,Design Disappointment,the United States,12-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,,"Purchased the Crosswave Pet Pro machine for Christmas (2018) to clean newly installed Engineered Vinyl Plank flooring in a home with 2 cats. Out of the box the machine was very easy to assemble and first use was fantastic, extremely light weight and relatively quiet compared to other vacuums. Reasons for purchase of this unit versus a Dyson was the ability to do daily dry cleaning and periodic wet cleaning of the flooring with the same machine. Given the fact this was advertised as designed for a pet household, sealed the deal. After about 3 uses the suction was virtually non-existent.This is where our rating takes a serious hit. There is a hepa filter on top of the canister. Very little of the dirt and hair vacuumed up by the machine ends up in the canister because it's trapped in the top by the filter. Rather than being positioned to prevent dust from being blown back into the house by the motor, the filter's on the top of the canister catching virtually all of the debris in a very small area on the top of the machine. This forces you to clean the filter at least every use (by hand), and sometimes during extended use (1,000 sqft of flooring on our first level), while the canister catches little of the debris.While we have not used it for wet cleaning yet, still having trust issues with the machine, it's dry cleaning leaves much to be desired. When the filter is clean it works great. But it gets bad fast so only little touch-up dry cleaning is recommended. Other reviews have commented on the small wet capability but we knew this going in so not expecting to have huge issues with this. But as a dry vacuum machine, not recommended, especially in pet households.So, bottom line, gave it 2 stars because it's easy to assemble, does work great for a short time; but the shortcomings of the design for us is its undoing. This is not adequate as a primary vacuum for pet households.",One
Oakwind,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Floor Cleaner,the United States,13-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,,"I am a Breeder/Exhibitor of Pembroke Welsh Corgis. I have anywhere between 6-12 dogs in the house at a time (not including puppies). I recently replaced 2000 sf of carpet ruined by the dogs and contractors. Mopping that much floor was exhausting and was looking for something that would allow me to do quick cleanups as well as deep cleaning without having a bucket of mop water around all the time. I must say that it has done the trick. It is light weight, doesn't over wet the floor so drying time is quick. Pulls up the hair, mud and paw prints tracked in, easy to clean and small size makes storage easy. LOVE the storage tray.",
Marvelous,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed For The Price,the United States,26-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,"This product disappointed me. I've got to dump the tank several times while cleaning because of it's small capacity. It doesn't do a great job on pet hair as most of it floats to the bottom of the tank (under the ""strainer"").

It’s the best cleaning present I ever received! The suction is so powerful. I have had it for 4 months now and no issues. I guess some people have had issues but not me! I have dogs and kids and I can sweep and clean my entire house in 30 min. The battery has never gone dead. I do have to stick my fingers in a cleaning port to remove hair but it’s no biggie. Anybody who is trying to decide to spend this money on a vacuum... do it! It’s a game changer. It does leave a tiny bit of water on the floor but it dries so quickly that my floors will not be damaged.,

I quickly realized I needed another vacuum that had greater suction and attachments. I cannot live without attachments. My routine: vac one time per week and vac + wash one time per week.

It doesn’t matter how many pets you have, this is not a great.  This does not work so great on hard surfaces, it tends to leave dirty water when it’s shut off. It gets clogged with hair/fur very easily. I find myself having to unclog it after only vacuuming a fourth of my bedroom.  The brushes are very hard to actually get clean. Maybe the suction isn’t strong enough. Maybe it should be rubber blades instead of brushes. But I find myself cleaning the product more than using it to clean.",

Kayla Rigney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Multi-Surface Wet/Dry Vacuum for Pet Owners,the United States,8-Apr-18,CrossWave Only,,"This Crosswave Pet Pro Wet/Dry Vacuum got a real work-out the day it arrived.  My Service Dog had a severe IBD flare; and my Crosswave Pet Pro got down to business.PROS1) The Crosswave Pet Pro works on both hard floors and carpet/area rugs - wet or dry.2) Easy to assemble and use.  Just measure Bissell's Pet Pro solution into the provided water bottle, snap in the bottle and you're ready to go!3) Provided Bissell Multi-Surface Pet Pro solution is clear and scent free.4) Removed the stain left by my dog's vomit and left my ancient carpet looking new. And it left my hard kitchen floor looking great, too.5) The Crosswave Pet Pro is easy to maneuver around and under furniture.6) Comes with an extra brush, so you always have a clean/dry one at hand.7) The multi- surface Pet Pro formula is made to specifically remove odor as it cleans. (It really does!)8) Easy to take apart, discard dirty water, clean brush and store. It comes with a brush cover and snap-on drying rack.NOT A CON BUT A CONCERN1) It's by necessity heavier that some dry vacuums. I'm a person with disabilities; and while I appreciate the Crosswave Pet Pro's ease of use, its weight was on the heavy side for me.  After about five minutes cleaning up pet stains, I was *done.*Speaking as one whose Service Dog has IBD, the Crosswave Pet Pro Wet/Dry vacuum is a godsend.  It's great for spot-cleaning those small pet stains. And it's made to clean larger areas as well. It does what it says it will do: it cleans up stains left after your pet makes a ""mess"" on the floor.  The Crosswave Pet Pro is a wet/dry vacuum that will leave your house looking and smelling fresh.5 Stars for getting the yellow bile stain out of the carpet.",2

The vacuum (with either style of brush head) cannot handle pet hair.  We have 1 collie and 2 cats and vacuum multiple times a week.  It jams in the tube and doesn't even make it to the canister.  On top of the fact that we had to clean it out every 30 seconds while vacuuming (not exaggerating) to avoid having to use a wire hanger to push a pet hair clog through the machine - the brush head connection points would get clogged with hair and start burning/melting.  Eventually the machine stopped working entirely because the connection point was so destroyed that the head wouldn't turn.  I truly don't understand how this vacuum received good reviews, it was the worst vacuum I've ever owned.",

Squeal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Has potential,the United States,15-Jun-18,CrossWave Only,,"I have hardwood floors through at least a third of my house and a shedding golden retriever, a cat, and very messy kids.  I love when I can find a good vacuum/mopper all in one as it saves me so much time from my vacuuming then steam mopping.  I was hoping the Bissell Crosswave would be my wonderful timesaver.  It definitely has potential but with a couple caveats.  When I started using it the first time, it worked like a dream in the beginning, leaving the floor nice and clean, but as I got to to the end of my kitchen, I noticed it was leaving dirty streaks.  The brush roll had just gotten so dirty it couldn’t seem to clean effectively.  The Crosswave really is not good at cleaning a whole lot of really dirty floor (it had been a while since I had mopped. Vacuumed yes, but not mopped).  If you use it regularly, this seems to help with the dirty streaks problem.  Also, cleaning up the Crosswave after using it is a lot of steps. It’s not something you want to skip though because not cleaning it will result in the dirty streak problem.  Cleaning It takes up quite up a bit of the time I saved from not having to vacuum and mop.  I’m hoping as I get used to the routine, it will get a bit faster to do.  So overall I feel that this is a nice machine and I am hoping with continue use, I will see better performance and get quicker at the after-care portion.",3

Laurel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good on really dirty muddy the floors,the United States,18-Nov-18,CrossWave Only,,"I've had two Floormates in the past that did not last so I decided to try the Crosswave based on the excellent reviews.  I have five long haired dogs and I live in the Northeast that produces tons of mud in the backyard.  The floor mate does a better job on muddy tile floors than the Crosswave.  I find that the Crosswave just smears the mud on the floor and you need to go over it multiple times for the machine to pick up the dirty water.  I believe this happens because of the roller design. If the roller becomes saturated with dirt, the streaking is more evident. Therefore, you have to stop and change the roller in the middle of the job.  The crosswise does a good job on laminate but it can also streak based on how much dirt there is.  I think the crosswise would be a good choice if you have minimal dirt and grime on your floors.",2

NOT with this unit.  This really leaves very little amount of water on the floor and does an excellent job on my wood and tile floors.  It does a good job as well on my area rub that sees a lot of traffic.  I think it really works best for area rugs that have tighter fibers and are not very long as there really isn't a lot of water that appears to go down.There are several great features that I love about this.1) That it has an extra brush that you can easily pop in and out with very little effort2) That it comes with a cleaning station, if your brush gets dirty, it has everything to need to clean it (doesn't show it in any of the pictures, but a tray that you can snap the entire vacuum in, poor solution into the tray, turn it on and let the brush spin in the solution to come clean.3) Easy removal of the dirty water as the clean and dirty water are in separate areas4) you can use your own solution if wanted, however I found the solution they provided works really well on my hard wood, no streaks or left over residue.5) Hard floor or Area Run setting, with a push of the button at top of the handle, letting you go from one to the other seamlessly.6) Generous cord length that wraps up nicely7) the Pet hair strainer does a fairly good job separating the pet hair from the waters, so when you dump it down the train you are not dumping hair down it to clog the drain.  You will want to be careful, if you have a lot of pet hair and monitor dumping the water down the drain the first few times to ensure you are not dumping down hair!It does a average job at vacuuming the food/crumbs left my my 3 kids.

Simply read the directions and you won't run into any of the issues from the 1 star reviews. Some people are too quick to pass judgment without taking the time to read a few lines. This vacuum is BETTER than the Dyson and shark. I actually want to clean my floors and I love the end results. I never knew my floors were so filthy. Cleaning is a breeze, I just dump the muck in the toilet and quick rinse in the sink. I have long hair and 2 dogs so my floors are always covered in muddy prints and hair.

It cut my floor cleaning time in half, if not more. The Bissell was easy to use and the floors dried super fast because the Crosswave sucked up the dirty water as I cleaned. It also sucked up the cat hair ( I have one cat) and strained it out so I could easily throw it in the trash. And there wasn’t cat hair left behind on the brush roll like I typically get using a traditional mop. The Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro is exactly what I needed!",
Faith Spondike,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks if not thoroughly cleaned after each use,the United States,25-May-19,CrossWave Only,,"It had great suction and did all it’s jobs well. However, on the second use it smells absolutely horrific, and at that point I realized it was the dirty water tank which needs to be cleaned out immediately after each use. Not a huge deal, although somewhat inconvenient. A few uses later I realized the brushhead and its compartment also needs to be cleaned after each use or else it will stink. We don’t have particularly dirty floors, and we don’t have any pets. Three months in and the liquid quit dispersing as efficiently. It seems like it’s immediately sucked up before it can do anything, so I have to use way more cleaning solution. It also leaves streaks on wood floors unless you are incredibly meticulous about fully drying before moving on - which takes a very long time. I was amazed the first time I tried it, but given the high maintenance and now the inefficient cleaning, I’d never recommend this.",

As you can imagine, the struggle is real.  THIS MACHINE IS SENT FROM HEAVEN!  I was a little hesitant on making such an investment but I'm glad i did. No more sweeping, vacuuming and sweeping again. It does everything all at once. Yes, the clean up is kinda nasty but I just dump the dirty water in the toilet. The cleaning solution goes a long way and smells great. It's super easy to use, manages corners and edges great. So far I have nothing bad to say about it. Makes my cleaning go super fast and well worth the money.

I love the idea that all of our dirty mop water isn’t just being pushed around our floors. The vaccuum works amazing on our rugs, but the scrubbing SUCKS. I have to go over and over... and over and over the same dirty spot on our tile and hardwood floors before the spots actually become clean. If you ask me it takes longer to clean my floors this way versus sweeping, mopping and vacuuming. I dont know if this item is worth the price honestly, for anyone who has been eyeing them.",
Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!!,the United States,30-Jan-19,CrossWave Only,,"I have 4 cats and one puppy and this wet dry vacuum works amazing on picking up cat hair and dirt. I have all hard wood floors, 3 throw rugs & vinyl floor in the downstairs of my house. The amount of dirt and hair it picks up is mind boggling, it picks up dirt and hair that I don’t even see on my rugs. The dirt container is always filled to the brim. The vacuum is easy to clean, the only thing I would recommend is for a long scrub brush (similar to a pipe cleaner) to clean in the small tube area that leads into the dirt container. That’s the best I can explain it but if you had the vacuum you would understand. The only complaint I have is the cleaner sometimes leaves a white film streak on the floor. This seems to happen in areas I run the vacuum over only once or twice. If I run the vacuum over it multiple times or don’t push the button for the cleaner as often then the streak is preventable. Overall I love this product and am buying the handheld upholstery cleaner next ! Thanks BISSELL !",

The tank is always full of clean water and solution, and when you empty the separate dirty water reservoir, boy can you see how much dirt it cleaned up!

After the first use we stopped to clean the filter, and readied it for the next room. The vacuum turned itself on and off multiple times, freaked us all out, and never turned on again. We cleaned the filter we tried trouble shooting it, however the vacuum was inoperable. This is the second Biseel we have had issues with.

The water does not get suctioned up properly- the dirty water never went into the ""dirty water compartment"", it just went all over my floor. Then if you try to mop a rug after using it, it makes your rug filthy. When not using the mop option- the air that blows out of the vacuum blows the dirt away before it gets suctioned up.

I used it on ceramic tile, marmoleum tile, nice hardwoods, crappy hardwoods, concrete, laminate, and on three different kinds of area rugs. It works and powers through all of it. Kinda felt like gagging when I saw what it got up that my dyson stick vac didn’t.",

In fact, I had such high hopes, when the first one I bought quit working and was deemed irreparable, I bought another one.  Now it has the same issue.  The pump/sprayer mechanism and the suction is no longer working.During the 3 to 4 months that the vaccmops were working, I was quite pleased with their performance.  However, at this price, I do not want to buy a machine every 4 months.Buyer beware.",
Nana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle worker!,the United States,27-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,,"Our vinyl floors get a lot use and a lot of in and out from a muddy back yard from both the family and the dog. I was very impressed with this vacuum that was able to tackle every bit of our floors, leaving them shiny and fresh smelling (I used the multi-floor pet solution). It was gross to see how dirty our floors were even after a weekly clean! Cleaning up the machine was also a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product. (I purchased mine elsewhere)",
VanessaMSC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful don’t buy,the United States,30-May-21,CrossWave Only,,This vacuum is awful. Not only did it spit dirt back out the back but the “wash” feature just spreads dirty water on your floor.The only nice thing I can say it was easy to put together and change brushes. After using it twice I’m returning to the storm tomorrow.,
Annette McCall,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not suck anything up anymore,the United States,3-Mar-19,CrossWave Only,,Absolutely loved it when I received it. Not anymore... clogged permanently.

Patricia,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The tanks are too little - you have to constantly stop, clean and refill.",the United States,17-Dec-18,CrossWave Only,,"The machine is for light duty cleaning NOT anything tough.  This house has filthy, ground in dirt and the Pet Pro does not get it.  Not only that, but I have Pomeranians with long hair and it wraps around the rollers so I have to cut it off the rollers.  Also, the machine will not clean up to the edge.  When you have to take the roller out and clean it, you end up with dirty water all over the floor where you are taking the machine apart.",

Also when you stand up the bissell after you’re done using it or just to simply move anything out of the way there is always a puddle of dirty water where it was sitting.

I have a lot of hard floors (tile and sealed wood) as well area rugs. The title says it all. My floors are gleaming. The fact that the Crosswave vacuums as it mops cuts the time it normally takes to vacuum and mop in less than half. The spinner brush can get up spots much faster than I can with a mop and elbow grease.,2

Dr. Zach Beims,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great at first, quickly declines",the United States,11-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,,"The first time we used this vacuum it was incredible, however, it quickly declined and is now to the point that we don't use it at all to avoid leaving large puddles of muddy water on the floor. Instead of picking up the cleaning solution, it just leaves it on the ground in puddles or streaks, working to just spread the mess around instead of actually picking it up. Look elsewhere for your next vacuum.",
siba2893,2.0 out of 5 stars,This product does a bad job.,the United States,7-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,,I really was hoping this machine would actually save time for me and I did try to love it. But I don't know if its my kind of tile or what but this machine leaves a terrible amount of marks and streaks all over my floor any time I use it. You can see the water spread evenly when you pass it forward but when you move it backward it leaves a bunch of streaks and sometimes even little pounds. I really can't do anything with it. I really feel sad for those 300$.,
Mariah,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is a beast (in a good way)!,the United States,13-Jul-18,CrossWave Only,,Bought this for our new home and vinyl floors. Since it’s a new area there is a lot of dirt flying in the air. We have two dogs and their hair seems to multiply. This thing vacuums well (probably not for tough jobs) but cleans the floor amazingly great. It’s gross and rewarding to see the brown filthy dirty water after each use. The clean up the first time was a little hard to figure out but the second and third time around is easy. Works perfect. Really really pleased with results.,
Benjamin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk cloggs,the United States,9-May-19,CrossWave Only,,"Bought it for my wife for Christmas. We have hardwood floors and 2 cats.

Bridgette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this machine,the United States,4-Jan-20,CrossWave Only,,"I have tried 3 others and this is by far the best machine.  I don't use it as a vacuum because I have 2 large long haired dogs.  I vacuum first and use this to clean the floors.

And I don’t mind that it doesn’t really deep clean. If you keepUp with you, you don’t have to, and if I have to deep clean a few times, it’s still a timesaver.

t. walters,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great concept, poor performance",the United States,25-Oct-21,CrossWave Only,,"The product worked well but began to fill the room with mildew odor during subsequent uses.  The spinning brush/roller leaves streaks and holds a lot of water.  You'll end up taking so much time breaking down and cleaning the machine after each use (and you have to clean it THOROUGHLY after every use)  that you might be better off simply using a mop and bucket.  Great concept, poor performance, and waste of money.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted to like it.. but it doesn’t work. ☹️,the United States,19-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,,I bought this before I brought my puppy home. I really wanted to love this and was so excited to use this when my pup has accidents to deep clean. The vaccum sucks up the water and crud but if you stop it all runs back out of the machine. Every single time I use it this happens. I’ve cleaned it every time and followed all directions. Very disappointed? Especially with the price tag and the amount of food reviews.,
Janine G,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not purchase!!!!,the United States,29-Sep-19,CrossWave Only,,"I am beyond disappointed with this product. From the day I received it, it was a messy machine.

However, this vacuum picks everything up and completely eradicates any pet smells. It makes cleaning a lot easier and quicker. I don't have to vacuum, and then mop.There are only two real downsides to it. One, it doesn't get close to the walls/furniture. There's about 1/2 an inch it can't get to once it's butted up against something. Two, you have to clean it every time you use it. It's not a big deal, and it does cut a lot of the time off cleaning, but overall it's wonderful.",

Christopher Albano,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer beware!!,the United States,16-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,,Buyer beware! This unit just doesn’t have the suction to get pet hair and water off the floor both. Floors are very streaky vacuum cleaner is easy because of the wet and dry application definitely not worth the money. Also customer support is aware of issues and they will not do anything to help other than to try and service it or send a new filters.

I was worried it would be hard to take apart and clean but I was shocked when I was able to detach each part, rinse, and dry in about 5 mins.

"Anything Office, Inc",5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the money,the United States,18-Jun-19,CrossWave Only,,I don't have much time to clean and this makes it much easier. It cleans my laminate floors better than anything I have tried and does not leave streaks. Cleans area rugs very well too. I love that with a switch of a button I can go straight from my floor to the rugs. I could not believe the dog hair it got up the first time I used it. And cleaning it is a breeze. I certainly hope it continues to work well and doesn't let me down but so far I would highly recommend it.,

GardenCat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I still find I need a mop bucket and don't like dumping the fill cup, but it is light and works beautifully as advertised",the United States,17-Mar-18,CrossWave Only,,"I am actually surprised this is living up to its promise because I didn't expect it to do what the videos were showing without clogging up and needing a lot of time wasted trying to cut off hair or unclog something.  There are 2 of us here with extremely long hair, and I saw that it said that it could handle hair up to 8 inches.  Well, ours is more like 28, and we also have 10 cats that come inside to eat and when it is very cold - and all the hair and fur stops up toilets and tubs and kills vacuum cleaners dead faster than fast.The beauty of this is that it is NOT full of tubes and hoses.  It squirts water out, and there's a furry roller with plastic brush teeth that pull everything back to go up one really short entry to the dump bucket.It is light and easy to maneuver.  It really washes and vacuums at the same time.  I can pick it up with one hand.The brushes do not get hair caught in the ends, but you take the ends completely off often to wash/dry them anyway.  There are no tools needed to take the brushes off- they are MADE to come off to dry after use!There's a base that you can put cleaning solution in, and run it in the base to clean the brush.There are some downsides, but I'm still giving it a 5 because I really do love it for my kitchen, bathroom, and low area rugs.Downsides-Emptying the FILL cup is some nasty business.  I cleaned up a nasty pet food area and needed to empty the bucket 3 times.  It fills quickly if you are mopping and vacuuming and the contents were pretty gross.  I poured them in the toilet but got scared I'd stop it up, so went outside.  I got my husband to get me a mop bucket so I could only make one trip out.  So personally, I still feel I need a mop bucket.-It's really best to only do small areas at a time if they are dirty.  The fluid runs out quickly.  For instance, I have a rug that is a short runner in front of my console.  It is only 2 feet wide and about 6 feet long.  I had to refill and empty twice while cleaning it, and it wasn't that dirty.  It did come really nice and clean though!  It looks new again.-The solution that it comes with, for me, was only enough to do one room and one rug.",5

Destini Layne Spencley,5.0 out of 5 stars,You wont regret it!,the United States,27-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this Crosswave after spending hours online, reviewing different vacuums. All the floors in my rental house are painted concrete.. which makes it exceptionally hard to keep clean; add in the fact that they're unsealed, which makes staining easy, and well.. I spend countless hours sweeping and mopping throughout the week.Did I mention I also have two dogs? No? A 190lb, mess-making Great Dane, and a small terrier who enjoys mud bathing almost as much as she loves fetch.THIS. This device is top notch. I've only had it a short time but I am SOLD. The first night I used it, I couldn't believe my eyes. The dog hair and muddy pawprints just vanished! It works so much better than a broom and mop.. I'm just disappointed I waited so long to purchase this.So long dog-hair dust bunnes!!(I've included a picture of my floor after using it on my concrete for the first time. I let the dogs in after a long play outside in the rain, in anticipation of this purchase and giving it a test run!)",5
Eric,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's better than manual mopping, but it isn't the smartest design",the United States,19-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"This is my first ever electric mopper, so I don't have anything to compare it. However, it unfortunately falls a bit short of my expectations. The mopper does seem to work; it cleans my tile floors with minimal effort required of me. I don't need to apply pressure or strain my back as I'd do using a classic manual mop.The issue is that I literally have to go over each tile about 3-5 times to clean all of the dirt and grime that has accumulated on it. I also have to move the mopper very slowly. Each individual 1'x1' tile might take 1-3 minutes to clean. This problem could easily be resolved by adding more weight to the scrubber, thereby increasing pressure against the floor (more elbow greese, so to speak).If the manufacturer were concerned about reducing maneuverability as a result of adding weight (and hence, more scrubbing power), they could have easily designed it to accept removable weights. This way you could add or remove weight to increase or decrease scrubbing capability as needed. Of course this would mean a little more power consumption, but that wouldn't be a problem.The other issue I experienced right from the very first use was when the clean liquid reservoir gets below half full, it's as if the suction feed to the brush head gets disconnected and loses flow. The mopper makes a distinctly different noise, as if the suction line were disconnected and sucking air instead of fluid. I'm sure there are ways to design around this issue for increased reliability.Finally, at $300, I was hoping for something more efficient and reliable. I'll still use it as needed, but if I purchase another electric mopper in the future, I'll most likely try a different model.",2
bama girl,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not a fan,the United States,17-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Everyone seems to thing this is greatest thing. I have 3 non-shedding dogs.

Jenn Ross,3.0 out of 5 stars,An honest review,the United States,17-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I had really high hopes for this as we have 3 kids and 2 dogs, I find it hard to keep up with mopping. I bought this hoping it would REALLY clean our area rug, again with kids and dogs, it has obvious stains, dried food etc.First, I had to buy a different brush for the area rug which was $19.99.It seemed to get alot of dog hair, so much so, i had to clean the roller in the middle of ""washing"" the rug. Suction with the rug roller was pretty good, i didn't have to use my other vacuum first so that's nice.Second, the original roller it comes with, it includes 2, so that's nice.The hard wood floor roller does PRETTY good with spot cleaning, im not sure i would replace actually mopping but since we have 3 kids, its nice and more practical to bring out the crosswave and just clean a few spots.Ive used my crosswave 3 times now and like i said i had REALLY HIGH hopes. A little disappointed it wasnt the miracle cleaning machine i had hoped for, but for now it is my favorite machine.",
Amanda ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely One if my best purchase,the United States,3-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I was a little bit unsure about this product at first because reading the reviews, specifically about the streaks that it was leaving on people’s floor- I have three types of floors on my first level I have ceramic tile I have vinyl and hardwood. Are used the product on all three and I found that if you do not use the drying method that It can leave streaks. So if you use it they way the instructions say specifically to, you will get non streak floors. Totally worth the money timesaver definitely deep cleans my floors. I’m a person who sweeps and mops my floor 3 to 4 times a week before this product and with the first time I used the Bissell vacuum mop the water was so dirty. I was so surprised. I was also worried about the maintenance and cleaning the product, but everything comes apart easily so very easy to keep clean!",

We tried vacuuming....good suction and easy to move....but the loud high pitched noise never quit.  We called Bissell support, who basically read us a very basic troubleshooting pointer that didn’t work. Then we were advised to return the vacuum to Amazon.

My cats have some ""bad habits"" and I love my animals, but geeeezzzz!  So this tool keeps me up off the floor and I feel like it can get the floor cleaner and cover a wider area that I ever could by hand.  It can take several passes to get rid of stubborn, dried on issues, but it's never failed to get rid of it eventually.  It's good for quick touch ups before an issue gets worse.  I never thought about cleaning the vacuum/scrubber itself, but it's quite easy with water in the tray.  You know you are a grown up when you are excited to receive and try out cleaning appliances!",

Then of course you have to clean the unit after each use which causes some mess on its own too.I suggest the SAMSUNG Electronics VR20T6001MW/AA Jetbot - runs on its own and has a lot better spot cleaning power. Then you just have to clean the pads. Money much better spent.",
Megz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed. Easier to just use vacuum and manual mop.,the United States,18-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,My floor linolium plank and is 800 ft² and I had to clean the Bissell 3 times and swap out the soft roller twice because it was not sucking up the liquid off my floor. It leaves behind a residue when using their solution. It does not switch from area run to hard floor easily as the area rug uses twice as much solution.  It did not remove any part of the stain on my area rug. I would rather just vacuum and then manually mop as I feel that would clean my floors better.,

This is the second Bissell I've owned the first was a steam cleaner and I had wall to wall carpet and two cats...that was several years ago and it worked like a dream.",One
Haeley Marie,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,the United States,30-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Works well on hardwood floors only. A small rug broke the vacuum all together after a year of owning. Forget about vacuuming a normal carpet because it barely gets the surface let alone deep suction.Waste of money for me.,One
John Wayne Lea,5.0 out of 5 stars,Time saving machine you’ll ❤️,the United States,27-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE ❤️ EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MACHINE‼️ Yes it’s love ❤️ after first room. However,be prepared for shock when your done when you thought your floor was sooooooo clean. Clean up a snap. 25 foot electrical cord a big plus. There is one(1) con. You’ll have a 1/2 inch or so that you will not be able to get against your baseboard. Really don’t let this minor con change your mind.",
linda freer,5.0 out of 5 stars,cleans & freshens,the United States,3-Feb-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I have wood flooring and area rugs.  The febreeze solution works nicely on both,  leaving the house looking and smelling clean.  The second time I used it the floors looked even better.  There may have been a residue of prior cleaning product on the floor.  I have a long haired dog and 2 cats.  there is no trace of pet hair or dander when i am done.  The long hair is trapped in the strainer basket when I empty it.  Unit works as described in advertising",
Lori L Taylor,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good,the United States,27-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I'm very disappointed in this product it vacuum great the first time but the second and third time it wouldn't vacuum up hardly anything and the filter in the top of the vacuum jug plugs all the time,One
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,the United States,29-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Just received this product and have only used it once but what a difference it makes. I was struggling with having to lift buckets of clean water and cleaning solution to wash the floors. This is easy to fill, push, and clean out.  My floors looked great and I have 2 dogs, including a bulldog who slobbers all over my hardwood and tile floors.  I recommend this especially if you need to clean your floors a couple times per week.",
Carrie Ann sanders,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seriously worth every penny!!,the United States,5-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Wow this product absolutely amazes me. I was skeptical but let me tell you I have a 1 year old, a cat, and 2 dogs, plus me and my husband both have long hair that sheds. The crosswave picked up everything!! I mean hair and debre and even sticky stuck on spots on our wood and and tile floor. It cut down our cleaning time in less than half and picked up stuff we didn't even realize was on our floors. I am totally impressed.",
jill l.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,the United States,9-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"So far I’ve given this a run for its money, we are having all new tile in our house, used this to clean up, it worked great, so much easier not having to sweep or vacuum before mop, also I scraped popcorn off two ceilings and tried to cover as much of my new floor as possible but of course that stuff goes everywhere, this made clean up great. Where has it been all my life 😊",
Olesya Stevens,5.0 out of 5 stars,In Love with this Bissell Crosswave Pet!,the United States,7-Jul-19,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We just bought a new house. Was looking for washing vacuum cleaner that does multi surface and also when you have pets. This Bissell Crosswave Pet is amazing! I washed my area rugs, tiles and the wood floors. Washes very well and suction is great, the tiles and the wood floors were dry in no time. Great quality, very light and does an amazing job! Absolutely great product!",
Paul Lemont,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed.,the United States,20-Oct-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"We have a very, very large open living, dining, kitchen and hallway area with luxury vinyl plank flooring.  I was so excited to try the Crosswave, really hoping it would cut down on sweeping, mopping time.  I was very disappointed.  Does an ok job cleaning but maintenance is a pain.  We have one cat and one dog, moderate shedders.  Constantly having to stop and remove the sticky wet pet hair from the strainer seemed to take as much, if not more time, than vacuuming and then using the wet jet.  Wet jet formula dries much faster and more convenient to rip off the dirty disposable pad and throw away than it is to run clean water through the Crosswave tray multiple times to clean the roller or cleaning out the filter, tank and wet pet hair after mopping an area.  Live and learn I guess.",
Marietta S. Litke,1.0 out of 5 stars,WASTE OF MONEY,the United States,17-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"After one year, it leaks, does not vacuum the disbursement.  have to go back to mopping the floor than I just need to put the mop in the washer.  this product is a lot of cheap plastic, ineffective motor and requires a lot of cleaning miniatous, not worth the time and money.",
Debbie Janow,5.0 out of 5 stars,HIGHLY RECOMMEND ♥️♥️♥️,the United States,9-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,I LOVE LOVE LOVE ❤️ this Vacuum. I wish I had taken my daughters advice and gotten it months ago. I have 2 Australian shepherds that live inside and they shed SO BAD. This machine picked it up great and due to the fact that it also sets the floor it helps to keep the hair from floating away before it gets sucked up ❤️.and it’s very light weight.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND,
s lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,In love with this power machine,the United States,16-May-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Awesome! In love with this convenient powerful machine has great suction, portable and lightweight. Haven’t used the rug cleaner but I’m going to try that out. But so far so good. Highly recommended. Nice color, the stand is a great feature.",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not use on hardwood floors!,the United States,8-Sep-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Do not use this on hardwood floors!  It left scratches everywhere!  I tried it on my tile floors, it didn't leave scratches on my tile, however, it left water everywhere as the suction is not strong enough to pull up the dirty water from the floor.  Also, the clean up part is a mess -  everything is collected into one container.  This got returned right away.",One
~Julia~,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect in every way!,the United States,19-Apr-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Absolutely amazing! This thing literally cut my work time in half! I would highly recommend everyone to get this every day handy helper while you can because you will not be disappointed! I use this thing several times a day since every floor in my apartment is tile and it never lets me down. My job has been so much easier. Thank you Bissell!,
Erin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,14-Nov-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Not super impressed. I had high hopes for it and I’m pretty disappointed. I have to sweep before using it. It leaves muddy streaks and you have to take it apart and throughly clean it after every use. A broom and mop take less time and do a better job.,
April Brackin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does fine,the United States,13-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"After all the hype I was expecting this to be some magical vacuum that solves all of my problems. LOL I will say it does it's job, but there is nothing that makes this stand out from other vacuums. I spend more time cleaning it out than I do using it. Pet hair clumps up when wet and gets stuck inside. Plus there is no attachment for it. You would think there would be an attachment to clean furniture and get into corners and hard to reach places if it is going to be a ""pet"" vacuum. I wouldn't recommend buying into the hype. Do more research and save yourself the hassle.",
Robert L,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super vacuum,the United States,4-Jun-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Super duperThis vacuum was almost retuned because my wife stated there is no way this will do as stated.After one use she was amazed and I have gotten more kisses for purchasing this than I have gotten in months.

Simona Lippens,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,the United States,14-Jan-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,Very disappointed.

tasha,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok,the United States,9-Dec-20,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"Only works on flat floors, our kitchen tile has a very small texture and unless I go over is 100 times it isn’t clean.

Hollyann Shelton,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hate it.,the United States,19-Jun-21,CrossWave Only,,I have had it for about 3 months now. It barely sucks up my dogs long hair.

Mary,3.0 out of 5 stars,WARNING do not use on area rug!!!!,the United States,13-Aug-20,CrossWave Only,,I've liked this for my hardwood floors but for the love of God do NOT use it for an area rug. For the $300 I spend I cannot believe how much this thing TRASHED my daughters area rug in her room the first time I tried cleaning it. I just bought the rug recently and its absolutely destroyed. I felt like this would be the perfect machine for me since I have all wood floors and it could help me with the couple area rugs I have and I was way wrong. Very disappointing.,One
Dylan Barries,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works good for a while. Bad for a lot of hair,the United States,17-Apr-20,CrossWave Only,,"I loved it at first but quickly came to realize this is not the vacuum for you if you have a lot of pet hair.  It gets full really fast and on a normal day of vacuuming I have to empty it like seven times. Plus hair gets wrapped up in the brush and on the side. It got so bad, even with me cleaning it out every few minutes that hair got stuck in the side where the brush turns. Mine still works right now but I know eventually it’ll be useless due to this. That’s my biggest complaint.",One

Sunni,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money!,the United States,6-Nov-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"I admit I liked the idea of helping animals. Also, the pro ratings seemed to outweigh the cons. I was excited to use the machine thinking it would cut cleaning time to about 1\3rd. So wrong. Using hot water as instructed, it wouldn't remove my dog's drool spots unless I went over the area multiple times. The vaccum feature picked up short hair, but didn't do as well on the long hair. I finally got disgusted and gave up. I don't know if it is the texture of the floor (faux wood ceramic tile) or exactly what, but I'm definitely not pleased. Will not buy another Bissel product (sorry furry friends!).",
carol,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s great,the United States,19-Sep-21,CrossWave Only,Verified Purchase,"With this machine I swept and mopped all in one, in half the time, and it did a great job. If there is stuff stuck on your floor you may want to pre treat. I love this machine it is great.",
